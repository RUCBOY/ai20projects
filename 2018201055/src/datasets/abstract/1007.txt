Problems that are carefully formulated lead students to develop more sufficient and realistic solutions. By front-loading the process of problem solving through problem formulation, students are able to reduce the amount of time spent on solution development, and thus increase their efficiency towards meeting their main objective. By teaching students problem formulation, especially in computer science related activities, foundational skills in computational thinking are introduced, used, and refined. Using a problem solving archetype as a means for this formulation is an effective tool for students to leverage. As computational thinking skills are honed, these concepts can translate across barriers into other content areas.
