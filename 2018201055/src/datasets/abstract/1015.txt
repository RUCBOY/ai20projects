The MPICH project is an example of translational research in computer science before that term was well known or even coined. The project began in 1992 as an effort to develop a portable, high-performance implementation of the emerging Message-Passing Interface (MPI) Standard. It has enabled the widespread adoption of MPI as a way to write scalable parallel applications on systems of all sizes including upcoming exascale supercomputers. In this paper, we describe how the translational research process was used in MPICH, how that led to its success, the challenges encountered and lessons learned, and how the process could be applied to other similar projects.
