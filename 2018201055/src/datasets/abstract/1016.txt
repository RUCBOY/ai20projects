Computational geoscience is an established field for better understanding and protecting our planet. It covers a wide range of different fields that are closely related to Earth systems. As a popular research area that largely relies on high performance computing, the efficient translation of novel techniques from computer science to practical geoscience solutions has emerged as an important and challenging problem. Based on a series of efforts in conducting interdisciplinary research in computer science and geoscience, this paper summarizes the measures we have taken and the lessons we have learned to successfully translate selected computational laboratory innovations into practical solutions.
