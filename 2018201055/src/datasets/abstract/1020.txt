Parametrized fixed points are of particular interest to denotational semantics and are often given by “dagger operations” [Stephen L. Bloom and Zoltán Ésik, Fixed-Point Operations on ccc's. Part I, Theoretical Computer Science (ISSN 0304-3975) 155 (1996), 1–38, https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(95)00010-0; Stephen L. Bloom and Zoltán Ésik, Iteration Theories.

Dagger operations that satisfy the Conway identities [Stephen L. Bloom and Zoltán Ésik, Fixed-Point Operations on ccc's. Part I, Theoretical Computer Science (ISSN 0304-3975) 155 (1996), 1–38, doi: https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-3975(95)00010-0.] are particularly useful, because these identities imply a large class of identities used in semantic reasoning. We generalize existing techniques to define dagger operations on ω-categories and on O-categories. These operations enjoy a 2-categorical structure that implies the Conway identities. We illustrate these operators by considering applications to the semantics of session-typed languages.
