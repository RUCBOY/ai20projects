The fields of computer vision (CV) and artificial intelligence (AI) have undergone rapid advancements in the past decade, many of which have been applied to the analysis of intraoperative video. These advances are driven by wide-spread application of deep learning, which leverages multiple layers of neural networks to teach computers complex tasks. Prior to these advances, applications of AI in the operating room were limited by our relative inability to train computers to accurately understand images with traditional machine learning (ML) techniques. The development and refining of deep neural networks that can now accurately identify objects in images and remember past surgical events has sparked a surge in the applications of CV to analyze intraoperative video and has allowed for the accurate identification of surgical phases (steps) and instruments across a variety of procedures. In some cases, CV can even identify operative phases with accuracy similar to surgeons. Future research will likely expand on this foundation of surgical knowledge using larger video datasets and improved algorithms with greater accuracy and interpretability to create clinically useful AI models that gain widespread adoption and augment the surgeonâ€™s ability to provide safer care for patients everywhere.
