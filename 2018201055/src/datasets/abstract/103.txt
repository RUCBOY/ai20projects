In this paper, we investigate a class of optimal circulant {0,1}-arrays other than the previously known class of optimal designs for fMRI experiments with a single type of stimulus. We suppose throughout the paper that n≡2(mod4) and discuss the asymptotic optimality and the D-efficiency of k×n circulant almost orthogonal arrays (CAOAs) with 2 levels (presence/absence of the stimulus), strength 2 and bandwidth 1, denoted by CAOA(n,k,2,2,1). We show that for n≡2(mod4) the largest possible value of k for statistically optimal CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) cannot exceed n∕2. We also clarify that CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) with high D-efficiency and k greater than n∕2 can be obtained via perfect binary sequences. By applying algebraic constructions for perfect binary sequences and by computer search, lists of such efficient CAOAs and the new class of optimal CAOAs are provided.
