The report documents the results of the project and sports training seminars modelling and embedded simulation, action sports simulation, and habitation. The main objective of this workshop is interdisciplinary and pan-disciplinarily research and computer science with technology following modelling to imitate the importance of sports at this seminar, experts in modelling and computer science, motion science and industrial simulation were invited to discuss the latest developments in these areas, computational models are used in motor control and learning, biomechanics, sports research, training, sports psychology, sports and applied sociology the impact of balance and embedded systems is directly felt in our daily walk of life. Sports training effect simulation embedded system Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA, appliances, aerospace applications anywhere in the network to reach the status of the sensor network embedded systems Sports competitions, sports and adaptation training. In short, this seminar shows that different areas of application face closely related issues. Discipline can benefit from mutual knowledge of the applicable theory that connects computer vision, biomechanics, and field experts
