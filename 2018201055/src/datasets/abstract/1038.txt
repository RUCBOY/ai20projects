Computers in Industry started 40 years ago with a mission to promote research in the use of computers within manufacturing industry. The journal was started by IFIP TC5 and aimed to cross boundaries, not only between countries but also between disciplines, and specifically between academia and practice.
This paper provides a personal view on the journal’s aims and scope over these four decades. Decisions were taken concerning these aims and scope which are described from a bird’s eye view. The arguments for such changes are outlined. The paper can be seen as a plea to continue with journals in interdisciplinary applied research, with academic rigor but also with practical relevance.
