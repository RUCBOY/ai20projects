This study contributes to the questions of which instructional methods are suitable for school, what instructional methods should be applied in teaching individual subjects and how instructional methods support the act of learning. All three questions represent challenges to general education and education in individual subjects. This study focuses on the empirical examination of learning outcome in chemistry education with respect to two instructional methods: the experiment method and computer simulation. An SPF-2 × 2•2 design is used to control instructional method, trial and class context. Learning outcome on reactions of metals is assessed. The empirical findings show that learning with computer simulation performs similar to the experiment method.
