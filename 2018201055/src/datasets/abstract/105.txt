Trading strategies play a vital role in Algorithmic trading, a computer program that takes and executes automated trading decisions in the stock market. The conventional wisdom is that the same trading strategy is not profitable for all stocks all the time. The selection of a trading strategy for the stock at a particular time instant is the major research problem in the stock market trading. An optimal dynamic trading strategy generated from the current pattern of the stock price trend can attempt to solve this problem. Reinforcement Learning can find this optimal dynamic trading strategy by interacting with the actual stock market as its environment. The representation of the state of the environment is crucial for performance. We have proposed two different ways to represent the discrete states of the environment. In this work, we trained the trading agent using the Q-learning algorithm of Reinforcement Learning to find optimal dynamic trading strategies. We experimented with the two proposed models on real stock market data from the Indian and American stock markets. The proposed models outperformed the Buy-and-Hold and Decision-Tree based trading strategy in terms of profitability.
