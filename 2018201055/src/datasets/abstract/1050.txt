The intelligent machine vision technology based on man-machine interaction mode has the advantages of weak intrusion, low adhesion and no device binding. With the development and progress of science and technology, the intelligent machine vision technology has become one of the most important directions in the field of humanâ€“computer interaction. Compared with the traditional interactive mode, the intelligent machine vision interaction technology is quite convenient, and the existence of these problems can also influence the vision of the intelligent machine to a certain extent. And the wide application of the sense interaction. At present, the operation precision is the main basis of the machine vision interaction design. Therefore, this paper studies the precision of the visual interaction of the intelligent machine. In this paper, three point-to-click experiments will be carried out on the basis of the Fitts' Law. The accuracy of the machine vision algorithm is experimentally studied from the operating direction, the mapping scale equation and the machine vision algorithm, and a reasonable suggestion is made for the intelligent machine vision interactive design of the human interaction mode.
