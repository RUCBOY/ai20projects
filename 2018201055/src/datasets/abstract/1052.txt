The management and maintenance of university laboratory is an important part of university work. With the rapid development of computer technology, computer-aided technology is widely used in the management and maintenance of university laboratories. This paper first analyzes the current situation of university laboratory management and maintenance, and points out the importance of computer-aided technology to manage and maintain university laboratory. Then, through the introduction of the Internet of things, the information collection, sensor technology, and other modules are used to build the university laboratory management system. Finally, by giving the credit security evaluation model of university laboratory management, the experiment of university laboratory security maintenance is completed on the data of different years. The experimental results show that the model constructed in this paper can evaluate the security situation of university laboratory management well. Through the use of the management framework and safety assessment and maintenance model, colleges and universities can ensure the orderly operation of the laboratory, through effective management and data analysis, reduce the potential safety hazards in the laboratory, and avoid unnecessary security problems.
