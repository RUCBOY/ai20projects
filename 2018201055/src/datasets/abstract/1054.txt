During last few years the computer applications have gone dramatic transformation from simple data processing to machine learning, thanks to the availability and accessibility of huge volume of data collected through sensors and internet. The idea of machine learning demonstrates and propagates the facts that computer has the ability to improve itself with the passage of time. The western countries have shown great interest on the topic of machine learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition via organizing conferences, workshops, collective discussion, experimentation, and real life implementation. This study on machine learning and computer vision explores and analytically evaluates the machine learning applications in computer vision and predicts future prospects. The study has found that the machine learning strategies in computer vision are supervised, un-supervised, and semi-supervised. The commonly used algorithms are neural networks, k-means clustering, and support vector machine. The most recent applications of machine learning in computer vision are object detection, object classification, and extraction of relevant information from images, graphic documents, and videos. Additionally, Tensor flow, Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2 model, and Anaconda software development environment used to identify cars and persons in images.
