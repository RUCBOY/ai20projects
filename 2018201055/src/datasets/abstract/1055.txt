The ternary optical computer (TOC) has the characteristics of numerous bits, bit-wise allocation, bit function reconstruction, parallel calculation, and easy extension of the processor. With the successful running of the adder on a 192-bit prototype system SD16 (an abbreviation of Shanghai Daxueâ€™s machine 2016) of the TOC in Shanghai University, the theory and technology of the reconfigurable optoelectronic hybrid processor have matured and the great advances have been made in this field. In this paper, based on cellular automaton, a three-lane traffic flow model is studied and applied on a ternary optical computer. The three-lane traffic flow model is designed and the steps for implementing the model on SD16 are provided in detail. An example of the three-lane traffic flow model is given to verify the correctness of the model and the feasibility of the implementation method. It takes advantage of the numerous data bits, reconfigurable operation bits, and parallel computing of the TOC.
