Environmental exposure to man-made electromagnetic field (EMF) has been rising as modern technologies have grown and changes in social behavior have generated more synthetic sources. For safety of human health, EMF levels need to be regulated. The level of EMF should be well below levels where there might be harm, hence we do not expect to see any health effects at these levels. Current regulations fail to place a strict limit on EMF in situations where multiple nearby devices transmit simultaneously. The way these regulations are expressed needs great care because it will have an effect on the design of wireless communication systems. In this paper, it is argued that transmitted power constraints on wireless communication devices should be expressed in a different way, namely that devices should limit the EMF spectral density that they generate to the difference between the maximum allowed, by the standard, and the amount currently present, as measured by the device, in the spectral region where it is active. Note that the limit on EMF should be expressed in terms of its EMF spectral density rather than as a total EMF over each of a series of separate bands. If all devices limit their own EMF spectral density, in the spectral region where they are active, in such a way that total EMF spectral density is below the regulated limit in that region, then it is certain that the aggregate EMF spectral density will be below the regulated limit at all frequencies.
