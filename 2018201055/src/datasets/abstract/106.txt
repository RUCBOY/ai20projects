The homodyned K (HK) distribution allows a general description of ultrasound backscatter envelope statistics with specific physical meanings. In this study, we proposed a new artificial neural network (ANN) based parameter estimation method of the HK distribution. The proposed ANN estimator took advantages of ANNs in learning and function approximation and inherited the strengths of conventional estimators through extracting five feature parameters from backscatter envelope signals as the input of the ANN: the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), skewness, kurtosis, as well as X- and U-statistics. Computer simulations and clinical data of hepatic steatosis were used for validations of the proposed ANN estimator. The ANN estimator was compared with the RSK (the level-curve method that uses SNR, skewness, and kurtosis based on the fractional moments of the envelope) and XU (the estimation method based on X- and U-statistics) estimators. Computer simulation results showed that the relative bias was best for the XU estimator, whilst the normalized standard deviation was overall best for the ANN estimator. The ANN estimator was almost one order of magnitude faster than the RSK and XU estimators. The ANN estimator also yielded comparable diagnostic performance to state-of-the-art HK estimators in the assessment of hepatic steatosis. The proposed ANN estimator has great potential in ultrasound tissue characterization based on the HK distribution.
