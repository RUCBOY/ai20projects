Spatial ability and self-regulated learning have broad implications for students. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the improvement of spatial ability and self-regulated learning of students who obtain computer-assisted learning using the 3D Cabri program. This quasi-experimental study with pre-test and post-test design involved 71 tenth grade high school students in Bandung, Indonesia. Furthermore, the experimental class obtained computer-aided learning using the Cabri 3D program, while the control obtained conventional learning using a scientific approach. The analysis discovered that (1) the improvement of students' spatial ability in the experimental class was better than those in the control class, (2) students of the experimental class achieved better spatial ability than those in the control class, (3) the improvement of students' self-regulated learning in the experimental class was better than those in the control class, and (4) students of the experimental class achieved better self-regulated learning than those in the control. These facts can help educators to consider the application of the Cabri 3D program in mathematics education in the future.
