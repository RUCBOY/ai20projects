As one of the most commonly used operations, multiplication has been widely used as the basis of other numerical operations. In order to simplify the multiplication application on Ternary Optical Computer (TOC), the mechanisms about the implementation of carry-free multiplication on TOC are discussed. And a modified signed-digit (MSD) based multiplication platform is designed and implemented. Using the platform, users only need to input the necessary operation parameters without needing to know any details about TOC. The platform automatically generates the necessary information that is needed in multiplication according to the application requests. And it sends the information formatted to the slave computer of TOC which answers for monitoring and controlling the operation process. Meanwhile, it answers for sending back the results to the users when the operation is accomplished. Experimental results show the multiplication application platform is feasible and correct. It can much simplify the multiplication application on TOC and can be used as the basis of other kinds of applications.
