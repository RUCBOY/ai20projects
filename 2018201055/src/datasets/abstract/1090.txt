The growing quality of computer graphics makes it difficult to classify real photos from rendered images. At the same time, a high-quality classifier that separates real-world photos from the images created by computer graphics allow solving many applied problems: from automatic evaluation of the quality of the image to detecting manually modified photos. The main directions of research in this area are associated with the identification of distinctive features in the images for use in classification models. In this paper, we provide experimental studies of various classification models and groups of features on the image dataset from Vkontakte social network. We show that the best choice from a variety of features for solving the classification problem is the combination of Haralick features, Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) with Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) descriptors and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) histograms. In addition, we show that Gradient Boosting model being trained on the specified combination of feature groups outperform other machine learning models with 90% accuracy.
