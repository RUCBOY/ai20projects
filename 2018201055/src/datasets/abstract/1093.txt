Static computer-assisted surgery (s-CAS) has been introduced to improve the results of implantology. A prospective cohort study was conducted following the STROBE guidelines to determine the presence of a learning curve in s-CAS. Six partially and six totally edentulous patients were treated by two surgeons experienced in implantology but completely inexperienced in s-CAS. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomography scans were matched to assess coronal, apical, and angular deviation and the positioning error. The accuracy data were used to evaluate the learning curve. Fifty-six implants were inserted. In partially and totally edentulous patients, the mean (range; standard deviation) coronal deviation was 0.87 (0.34–1.27; 0.35) and 1.24 (0.72–2.67; 0.79); the mean apical deviation was 1.13 (0.48–1.63; 0.39) and 1.52 (0.88–3.84; 1.15); the mean angular deviation was 2.63 (1.89–4.50; 0.98) and 3.59 (1.69–6.30; 1.65); and the mean positioning error was 0.80 (0.32–1.25; 0.35) and 1.14 (0.35–2.56; 0.77), respectively. A typical ‘learning curve’ effect was not identified for s-CAS.
