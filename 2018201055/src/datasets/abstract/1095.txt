Human computer interaction plays an increasingly important role in our life. People need more intelligent, concise and efficient human-computer interaction. It is of great significance to optimize the process of human-computer interaction by using appropriate calculation methods. In order to eliminate the interference data of thumb recognition based on sEMG signal in the process of human-computer interaction, simplify the data processing, and improve the working efficiency of general equipment of sEMG signal. In the process of gesture recognition using sEMG signals generated by thumb, a method of redundant electrode determination based on variance theory is proposed. The redundancy of five groups of action signals is divided into 16 levels and visualized. By comparing the results of thumb motion recognition when different redundant channels are removed, the optimal channel combination in the process of thumb motion recognition is obtained. Finally, two kinds of classifiers suitable for sEMG signal field are selected, and the classification results are compared, and the best method of thumb motion pattern recognition is obtained.
