Parkinson’s disease is a neurogenerative disorder that occurs due to the loss of dopamine-producing cells. Till now, there is no cure for this disease but correct medications can slow down the progression. Therefore, early diagnosis of this disease is very important to improve the quality of life of Parkinson patients. This paper provides a comparative analysis of computer-assisted technologies for classification, prediction, and monitoring of Parkinson patients. The articles are selected based on the type, source of data, and symptoms to diagnose Parkinson’s disease. Our contribution in this paper includes the study of recent articles from the year 2017, 2018, and 2019 and some other articles to consolidate some of the previous work as well. Research articles are chosen based on symptoms, type, and source of data to cover each aspect of Parkinson’s disease. There is a great potential for early diagnosis as well as improving the quality of life with the help of computer-assisted rehabilitation techniques. We have divided our analysis into six sub-categories. A detailed analysis has been done on each sub-category. Information about some tools, software, and libraries are provided for the use of researchers. A comparison has also been done on different feature extraction and classification techniques so that researchers can further explore these techniques. Research gaps and future directions are also discussed along with challenges related to each gap for researchers to work on.
