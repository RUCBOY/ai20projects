As we know, the world today is based on 5G and 3D technology, where everyone needs a fast processing unit for mobile applications. CORDIC is an approach that is capable of performing trigonometric calculations in a fraction of time. As for the old processing unit, they have only a computing unit which contains only ALU, but which is not sufficient for the rapid processing of the trigonometric function, so that the CORDIC algorithm is converted into a CORDIC processor which is capable of fast processing. In this paper, we conducted a comparative detailed study of the previous existing CORDIC algorithm and the CORDIC processing unit. In this we also did a comparative analysis of the system level and a comparative assessment based entirely on algorithm and structure level, primarily based on the parameters.
