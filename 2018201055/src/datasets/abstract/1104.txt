Fibre rope usage in deep sea lifting operations is gaining more prominence in recent times. With rope minimum break loads (MBL) comparable to that of their steel wire counterparts, the use of high modulus polyethylene (HMPE) ropes is seen as a viable option for use in subsea construction cranes. The ropes are worn out during use and visual inspection remains one of the main methods of determining whether a fibre rope is to be retired from use, therefore a natural extension is condition monitoring through computer vision. Creep and temperature are constraining with HMPE ropes and should be monitored continuously, particularly when the rope is cyclically bent over sheaves. Additionally, interpreting the thermal history of the rope during use could give insight into deterioration. In this paper, a condition monitoring system based on combined computer vision and thermal monitoring is used during cyclic bend over sheave tests performed on 560Â kN break load of 12 strand braided HMPE ropes. New monitoring features such as local length and width through computer vision algorithms combined with surface thermal monitoring and global elongation are presented and their effectiveness as condition monitoring features is assessed.
