This paper is dedicated to numerical computation of higher order derivatives in Simulink. In this paper, a new module has been implemented to achieve this purpose within the Simulink-based Infinity Computer solution, recently introduced by the authors. This module offers several blocks to calculate higher order derivatives of a function given by the arithmetic operations and elementary functions. Traditionally, this can be done in Simulink using finite differences only, for which it is well-known that they can be characterized by instability and low accuracy. Moreover, the proposed module allows to calculate higher order Lie derivatives embedded in the numerical solution to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Traditionally, Simulink does not offer any practical solution for this case without using difficult external libraries and methodologies, which are domain-specific, not general-purpose and have their own limitations. The proposed differentiation module bridges this gap, is simple and does not require any additional knowledge or skills except basic knowledge of the Simulink programming language. Finally, the block for constructing the Taylor expansion of the differentiated function is also proposed, adding so another efficient numerical method for solving ODEs and for polynomial approximation of the functions. Numerical experiments on several classes of test problems confirm advantages of the proposed solution.
