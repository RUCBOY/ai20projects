Digital dermatitis (DD) is linked to severe lameness, infertility, and decreased milk production in cattle. Early detection of DD provides an improved prognosis for treatment and recovery; however, this is extremely challenging on commercial dairy farms. Computer vision (COMV) models can help facilitate early DD detection on commercial dairy farms. The aim of this study was to develop and implement a novel COMV tool to identify DD lesions on a commercial dairy farm. Using a database of more than 3,500 DD lesion images, a model was trained using the YOLOv2 architecture to detect the M-stages of DD. The YOLOv2 COMV model detected DD with an accuracy of 71%, and the agreement was quantified as “moderate” by Cohen's kappa when compared with a human evaluator for the internal validation. In the external validation, the YOLOv2 COMV model detected DD with an accuracy of 88% and agreement was quantified as “fair” by Cohen's kappa. Implementation of COMV tools for DD detection provides an opportunity to identify cows for DD treatment, which has the potential to lower DD prevalence and improve animal welfare on commercial dairy farms.
