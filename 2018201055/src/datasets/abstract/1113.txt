In this paper, we present an application of the homotopy perturbation transform method to compute the approximate analytical solution of the nonlinear fractional order computer virus propagation (CVP) model. The fractional derivatives are used in Caputo sense. The proposed approximate method generates the numerical solution in the shape of a rapid convergent series by utilizing the provided initial conditions. The main purpose of the paper is to analyze the effect of variation of fractional order α on the meeting time of susceptible, infected and recovered computers. Moreover, the local stability analysis of the fractional order computer virus model is also presented using Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion.
