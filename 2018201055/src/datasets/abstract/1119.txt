Connected vehicles can transmit real-time information to traffic control management systems. Despite the recent technical advances of telecommunication networks and mobile computing there have been no real-time adaptive traffic signal control experiments with connected vehicles. Most of the research in this field has been carried out only with simulations. In this work we present the computer system that was adopted to regulate traffic signals in real-time with "smartphone-connected" vehicles as the only source of information. We introduce the description of the computer system architecture that was deployed in an experiment of a Floating Car Data (FCD)-based adaptive traffic signal in which a traffic signal has been regulated in real-time with 100% "smartphone-connected" vehicles. The description of the system based on commonly-used technologies could help others to develop and deploy new traffic signal management systems in new "connected" intersections.
