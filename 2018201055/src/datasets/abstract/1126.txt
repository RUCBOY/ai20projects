Since the invention of the first computer, scientists have striven to minimise the size – and we can see the fruits of their efforts in the form of the Raspberry Pi. This is a series of small, single-board computers developed to promote the teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing countries. According to the Raspberry Pi Foundation, more than five million Raspberry Pi boards were sold by February 2015, making it the best-selling British computer. By November 2016 the Foundation had sold 11 million units, and by March 2017, 12.5m, which made it the third best-selling ‘general purpose computer’. In July 2017, sales reached nearly 15 million and less than a year later, in March 2018, 19 million.
