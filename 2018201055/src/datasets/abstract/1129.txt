Security research on the employees’ expressive motives in committing computer-related deviant behavior is limited. In this research, drawing on the appraisal tendency framework (ATF), we examine how employees’ emotions (anger vs. fear) and perceived sanctions influence their computer-related deviant behaviors in the workplace. Our empirical results show that employees who experienced anger were more likely to commit computer-related deviant behavior mediated by perceived informal sanctions. In contrast, employees who experienced fear were less likely to commit computer-related deviant behavior mediated by perceived formal and informal sanctions. The results provide important guidance for organizations to improve the effectiveness of deterrent controls.
