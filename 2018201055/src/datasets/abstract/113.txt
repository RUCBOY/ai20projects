Recent results by R. Szász, individually and in collaboration with E. Deniz and M. Çaglar, and foundational work by U. Jayatilake collectively combine to provide a proof of Brannan's longstanding coefficient conjecture for the case that β=1. The resulting cumulative proof of the conjecture relies on a computer-assisted argument. In this paper, we present new results and use them to provide a complete direct analytical proof of the conjecture.
