Computer modelling is expected to play an increasingly important role in fusion design and technology, where the complexity of the physical processes involved (plasma, materials, engineering), and the highly interconnected nature of systems and components (“system of systems” design), call for support from sophisticated and integrated computer simulation tools. In this paper, we review the contribution of coupled computer modelling to the design of the reactor, breeding blanket and integrated first wall in terms of neutronics, materials behaviour (including plasma-materials interaction, radiation effects and compatibility with fluids), magnetohydrodynamics thermofluid issues and thermo-hydraulic aspects, as well as simulations of plasma transport out of the confinement region to determine heat and particle loads on plasma facing components. The current capabilities and levels of maturity of existing simulation tools are critically analysed, having in mind the possibility of integrating several tools in a single computational suite in the future and highlighting the perspectives and difficulties of such an endeavour.
