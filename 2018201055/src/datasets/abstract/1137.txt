The presence of mineral impurities in acrylic fibers leads to disruption of its structure, additional defectiveness during thermal treatment, reduction of characteristics of carbon fiber produced from it [1,2]. In this paper the issue of acrylic fiber thermal treatment regime optimization involving computer modeling with allowance for density growth kinetics descriptive models and weight loss models, exo-effect and equipment characteristic. The findings are consistent with the data in [3] and confirm the thermal activation capability of thermal stabilization process.
