Distributed computing offers an incredible variety of quick, flexible delivery of assets following the interests of customers, expanding the classification data to provide and prepare essentials. The rapid development of its huge interest in this innovation, and in many applications, including government, business, and the order has been accepted. At the same time, the complexity of the material helps to understand the student computer science and related topics by eliminating regional requirements, improving refinement, and rewarding experience to display computer science and related topics to Cloud. Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is used by accelerating computationally expensive applications. Low power utilization drawn from industry and academia are important considerations. FPGA is the base attraction towards the treatment of intangible assets and their distributed computing circles reconfigurability of the causes and adaptability in critical mode. The basis for most universities are the use of under-utilized assets, adjusted asset utilization, happen to have flexible and innovative requirements. A new approach is introduced to software engineering, virtual or Open Distance Learning (ODL) data, and the University of Understudies e-learning Phase. This structure is calculated by measuring dispersion and tends to (cloud virtual frame-based study hall) administration layers. The basic part (in coordination with the cloud and software engineering process) is to develop a cloud program open academic expectations separation learning atmosphere. Finally, it is the way to achieve the structure proposed.
