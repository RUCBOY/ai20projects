Breast cancer is the second prevalent type of cancer among women. Breast Ultrasound (BUS) imaging is one of the most frequently used diagnostic tools to detect and classify abnormalities in the breast. To improve the diagnostic accuracy, Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system is helpful for breast cancer detection and classification. Normally, a CAD system consists of four stages: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In this chapter, the pre-processing step includes speckle noise removal using Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion (SRAD). The goal of segmentation is to locate the Region of Interest (ROI) and Active contour-based segmentation is used in this work. The texture features are extracted and fed to a classifier to categorize the images as Normal, Benign and Malignant. In this work three classifiers namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, Decision tree algorithm and Random Forest classifier are used and the performance is compared based on the accuracy of classification.
