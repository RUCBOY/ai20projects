This study proposed an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine studentsâ€™ intention to use tablet computers in K12 settings. The participants were 347 middle school students who were engaged in a tablet-based instructional initiative. We used the partial least squares (PLS) approach to test the relationships between perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitude, intention to use, self-efficacy, technology anxiety, and family support. The results suggested that the extended TAM offered a good explanation of tablet computers acceptance of K12 students. Findings from this research not only inform the successful practice of educational technology initiatives but also lay the foundation for future research.
