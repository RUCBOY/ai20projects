The prevalence of unipolar depression among adolescents in India is high. Cognitive behavior therapies (CBTs) are considered the current gold standard treatment for depression in adolescents; however, their access is limited in India. Given the ubiquity of technology including smartphones and computers, technology can be leveraged to improve access of CBT treatment in India. Our team developed smartteen- a computer application designed to augment in-person CBT for treatment of depression in adolescents. This paper will present results of the pilot evaluation of smartteen (a cCBT) for its feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms. Twenty-one adolescents with unipolar depression seeking treatment at a tertiary care hospital were randomly assigned to smartteen (n = 11) and TAU (n = 10). Both groups received twelve weeks of treatment and were assessed at baseline, mid-treatment (6 weeks) and post-treatment (12 weeks) using four clinical measures including BDI-II, CDRS-R, CGI-S and CGAS. smartteen was shown to be feasible and acceptable treatment to adolescents. At 6 weeks, both treatments were effective in reducing depression. At 12 weeks, smartteen was significantly more effective than TAU in reducing depression symptoms and improving functioning on CGAS. Treatment compliance was better in smartteen group. smartten was shown to reduce the time spent by therapist to deliver 12 sessions of CBT treatment for depression. Results indicate that smartteen may be subjected to more rigorous evaluations with larger samples and considered for wider implementation if found effective.
