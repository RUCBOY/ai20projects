With the development of recent technology, radiographs can be saved digitally, and angular measurements can be processed using various software packages. We developed an innovative computer-aided design method with Materialize Interactive Medical Image Control System software to measure hallux valgus angle (HVA), the intermetatarsal angle (IMA), and the distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA) and assessed its concordance with traditional X-ray imaging methods. All measurements were carried out on 42 feet from 26 adult patients diagnosed with hallux valgus who were prospectively selected from July 2016 to April 2018. Standing X-ray radiograph and weightbearing computed tomography scans were conducted on all patients, and HVA, IMA, and DMAA were generated using both a traditional X-ray method and our innovative method. Two different observers assessed measurements for each patient. Finally, statistical analyses were conducted to assess the reliability of the measurements. Both X-ray imaging and our innovative method had strong interobserver and test-retest reliability. The ICC of X-ray imaging was 0.945, p < .001, and the ICC of the innovative method was 0.915, p < .001. There was no statistical difference between the 2 methods for HVA and IMA measurements (p > .05); however, a difference was detected for DMAA (p < .05). Bland-Altman analyses demonstrated a high degree of agreement between the 2 methods for HVA and IMA, but a significant difference for DMAA. From the results, we concluded that our innovative computer-aided design method is a feasible, reliable way to quantitatively assess HVA, IMA, and DMAA, and it is likely more accurate for measuring DMAA.
