Authors analyze the structure of jet impingement systems used for computer cooling. We propose the algorithm for optimal synthesis of such systems. The total heat transfer coefficient is being minimized in this process. It corresponds to the minimization of the heat transfer surface when the heat flux is given. Authors show that the optimal sequence in which the cooling flow contacts devices being cooled depends only on the temperature of every device, but not on its power output. When temperatures of devices are equal, the cooling flow must be distributed in parallel, otherwise it must be supplied sequentially. The paper presents expressions both for the value of the total heat transfer coefficient and values of individual heat transfer coefficients.
