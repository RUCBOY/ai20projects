In this study, we examined the teaching effectiveness of three strategies (trial-and-error, textbook, and combination) via a computer-based learning environment (CBLE) that teaches smart-home installation (SHiB). One hundred and twenty-five participants were randomly assigned to one of the strategies and tested with SHiB CBLE. Findings revealed that participants in the combination condition performed significantly better than those in the textbook (control) group with medium effect-size (g = 0.70). Senior participants in the trial-and-error group performed significantly better than those in the control condition with large effect-size (g = 0.89). Younger participants in the combination condition performed significantly better than those in the control condition with medium effect-size (g = 0.70). Results suggest that the teaching strategies had differential effects due to age groups.
