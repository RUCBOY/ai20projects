This experimental study systematically investigates the separate and interactive effects of mastery goal orientation (low versus high), collaboration-script use (with versus without) and computer mediation (face-to-face versus computer-mediated) on performance outcomes (i.e., report grades and lengths), affective outcomes (i.e., process satisfaction and solution satisfaction), motivational outcomes (i.e., collaborative learning self-efficacy, group efficacy, and task value), and social ability. Specifically, 99 undergraduate students identified as having either high or low mastery goal orientations were randomly assigned to use either face-to-face or computer-mediated interaction to complete two group assignments, one with scripted instruction and one with unscripted instruction. Statistical analysis revealed that those using collaboration scripts wrote significantly longer reports, and those participating in face-to-face collaboration had significantly lower grades and co-presence. Computer-mediated collaboration was found to have two significant interactive effects, (1) with collaboration scripts, on satisfaction with the discussion process, and (2) with mastery goal orientation, on report length. Additionally, the study identified a significant three-way interactive effect of collaboration scripts, computer mediation, and mastery goal orientation on group efficacy.
