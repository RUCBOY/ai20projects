Introduction of new technical solutions and technologies makes technical systems keep up to date and adapt to all changes. The article is devoted to the development of a tool that will help intellectualize strategic planning of the autoservice system development. Today, one of the most effective methods of management intellectualization in large systems is Decision Support System (DSS) based on simulation models and optimization algorithms. Authors propose models that help to improve logistic system of autoservice network through optimization of spare parts deliveries, number of workers and stations in each autoservice center. After verification and validation of the developed model, a computer experiment was conducted with the current parameters taken from the real autoservice network. The obtained simulation values are reliable at a 5% significance level. Suggested models can be used for assessing functioning of the autoservice network as a whole and every autoservice center in particular. This will allow strategic planning for improving and expanding the autoservice network, as well as checking the possibility of reconstruction existing autoservice centers for repair and maintenance of vehicles fueled compressed natural gas.
