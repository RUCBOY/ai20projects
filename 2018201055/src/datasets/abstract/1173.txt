“Zoom fatigue”—theorized here as part of a larger experience with computer-mediated communication (CMC) exhaustion—has emerged as a common negative experience through prolonged use of CMC platforms. Despite CMC exhaustion’s ubiquity, the relatively novel phenomenon has caused much speculation for its root causes with little information pinpointing why it occurs. Utilizing research, observations, and personal accounts, this article explores synchronous online consultations (SOCs) within writing centers as matching sites to ponder the basis for CMC exhaustion. In doing so, third skins are proposed to account for how nuanced differences in space between SOCs and face-to-face exchanges mean participants are not engaged as human actors but “flattened” into a totality of third skin comprising person, background, and technology. The resulting transformation and our bodies exerting substantial cognitive efforts to interact with this transformation are theorized to produce CMC exhaustion. The implications for this are twofold: 1) for readers interested in the underlying causes of CMC exhaustion, this work presents a framework to test the ideas proposed and develop mitigating strategies, and 2) for readers who study SOCs, third skins might explain previously observed limitations in the effectiveness of visuality in CMC.
