Recent studies have indicated that the use of recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) is a viable adjunctive to alveolar cleft reconstruction owing to its osteoinductive capacity. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of rhBMP-2 in the treatment of alveolar cleft with autologous bone graft by precise volumetric analysis. Twenty-six patients (ages 8 to 14) with unilateral alveolar clefts were enrolled in this comparative study. Patients were divided into two groups: the iliac crest bone graft (ICBG) was placed at the side of the cleft in the control group (ICBG group), and rhBMP-2 was mixed with the ICBG in the rhBMP-2 group (BMP group). Helical computed tomography images were obtained preoperatively and 12 months postoperatively. The datasets were reconstructed as three-dimensional (3D) images using Mimics software, and were processed using Geomagic Wrap. The newly formed bone of the alveolar cleft was segmented by identifying the differences between pre- and postoperative 3D images. In the ICBG group, the volume of newly formed bone ranged from 0.25 to 0.88 cm3, and the bone formation percentage was 42.01 ± 15.57%. In the BMP group, the volume of newly formed bone ranged from 0.34 to 1.09 cm3, and the bone formation percentage was 55.79%±11.84%. There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of postoperative bone formation percentage (p = 0.022). Thus, rhBMP-2 combined with an autologous bone graft is a promising technique to improve the results of secondary alveolar bone grafting.
