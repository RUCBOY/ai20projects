The automotive industry is constantly growing with the continuous creation of new technologies in the components industry, also requiring a greater quality control during their manufacturing process. The scrap data management is fundamental to being able to have a sense of where the main production problems are and when to act on them in order to improve processes and reduce scrap costs, getting continuous improvement. In this work, a computer application was created and implemented to manage the information regarding scrap data reporting. Current procedures for reporting and processing scrap data followed a very complex set of steps that made much of the reported information inconsistent and in some cases not even correctly reported, leading eventually to a dataset whose reliability was affected. To address these problems, a computer application for scrap reporting and data management was then created which integrated all existing procedures into one application and standardized all reporting and data processing procedures. In this way, it was possible to optimize scrap reporting and data analysis processes, improving reliability by 76% and, combined with all of this, reduce the time and associated costs related to scrap data treatment procedures by about 75%.
