The effects of a sit-stand-walk intervention to reduce musculoskeletal discomfort, attenuate perceived physical and mental fatigue, and increase physical activity without adversely affecting productivity was investigated for computer-based work. A between-participants design was used with 80 participants randomly assigned to one of five work conditions (sit-stand, stand-sit, sitting, standing and sit-stand-walk) to perform a 60-min computer-based typing transcription task. Musculoskeletal discomfort, and perceived physical and mental fatigue were reported through surveys; productivity was measured by typing speed and typing errors. For the sit-stand-walk intervention musculoskeletal discomfort was significantly less compared to sitting or standing for the hour; perceived physical fatigue was significantly less compared to standing for the hour. There were no benefits or differences among the work conditions in terms of perceived mental fatigue and productivity. By combining postural variability of sit-stand workstations with intermittent light-intensity physical activity enabled by active breaks, the sit-stand-walk intervention demonstrates a beneficial and viable alternative to sedentary office work.
