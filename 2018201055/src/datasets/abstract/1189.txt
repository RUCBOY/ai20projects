In this study, a novel metal-organic framework (MOF) delivery system for a food bioactive was developed. A series of molecular simulations tools, reported in recent years, have been applied to predict and optimize the delivery system. First, Zr-based MOF UiO-66, was synthesized with zirconium (IV) chloride and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid. Then, curcumin was encapsulated in it using a post-synthesis loading method. Both spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed that the system achieved a high loading capacity of 3.45% w/w. The crystal structure, porosity, morphology of the curcumin delivery system were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), physisorption analyzer, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS), respectively. An in vitro digestive test showed control release of curcumin in the simulated intestinal fluids (SIF). Around sixty percent of curcumin was released after 180Â min of digestion. This research demonstrated that stable MOFs might have potentials in constructing efficient delivery systems.
