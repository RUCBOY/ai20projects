The computation of teletraffic (traffic for short) delay bound is crucial to the guaranteed quality of service in computer communication networks. Traditional non-fractal bounds of traffic delay are loose so that network resources may be over-required for guaranteed quality of service. How to obtain a tighter bound of traffic delay, in fact, is an open problem. This paper gives a solution to that problem by proposing four fractal delay bounds of traffic. We will show that the present fractal delay bounds are tighter than the conventional non-fractal ones.
