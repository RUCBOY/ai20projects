A general-purpose programmable logic device that allows Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to be manufactured on-chip from simple logic gate operations, or a Sobel algorithm complex system implementation is done by the customer after configuration. All tools are appropriate for the learning process, which can be accessed or downloaded from all over the world with the use of the Internet. Video materials provide computer courses web design concept, based on the potential problems, and also provide a special auxiliary FPGA, the teaching, problem-based approach which is much easier. Therefore, the purpose of the system is to provide intuitive tools, web design courses, understand the Sobel algorithm test before major physical system real-time video processing algorithms, and the creation and practical implementation based on video quality. The purpose is also to prove the potential purpose of developing FPGA-based systems and Sobel algorithms. Video teaching is a procedure of hiding the message into video in such a way that no one can detect its presence. In proposed work, sobel algorithm namely random scan and edge detection is used for hiding the data into video. The development of practical examples of video lessons and reasons to support real-time video processing has been proposed. It re-programmes the FPGA, allowing you not only to verify integrity of the design itself but also the establishment of an early prototype sub-circuits using the same development board.
