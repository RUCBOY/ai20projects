In computer-controlled optical surfacing (CCOS), the paths of the lap tools are limited inside the optical surface; this restricts convolution in the dwell-time algorithm and causes mid-spatial-frequency surface errors. An optimized strategy ensuring relatively complete convolution of the dwell-time algorithm is developed to control the mid-spatial-frequency surface error and simultaneously ensure high optical manufacturing efficiency. Different-sized lap tools are then introduced to correct the surface error in different areas of the optics. Simulations and experiments using a large off-axis SiC mirror demonstrate the validity of the strategy, and it could be widely applied to CCOS in grinding or polishing processes.
