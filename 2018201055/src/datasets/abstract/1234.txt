Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack on critical infrastructure networks has increased rapidly in recent past and therefore it is a matter of great concern that how to safeguard these targeted network resources. Our paper proposes a defense strategy by introducing quarantine compartment in the population of computer in a critical infrastructure network so that even in the case of attack the network should perform its operations successfully. This strategy if implemented properly may control propagation of malicious objects by reducing the rate of infection to a great extent. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to analyse that can quarantine help in reducing the damage of the critical infrastructure network by preventing the outbreak as epidemic? Our proposed differential model is analysed at infection free and endemic equilibrium points to find the conditions for their local and global stability. Numerical methods and simulation tools are employed to solve and simulate the system of ordinary differential equations developed.
