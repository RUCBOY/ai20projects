The aim of the study was to assess if there is a time difference (operative time, ischemia time, planning time and hospitalization) between computer-assisted surgery (CAS) and conventional planning in cranio-maxillofacial surgery. An electronic search was performed in June 2018. Studies comparing time difference between CAS and traditional planning were included. 28 publications were included, with 536 patients in the CAS group and 784 in the control group. 18 studies reported on mandibular/maxillary reconstruction and a meta-analysis was conducted on 15 of these studies. This meta-analysis was undertaken to demonstrate the difference between the groups regarding operative time, ischemia time and hospitalization for mandibular/maxillary reconstruction and showed a decreased operative time for the CAS group with a mean difference of −84.61 min, 95% confidence interval [−106.77, −62,45], p < 0.001. Ischemia time was also decreased, with a mean difference of −36.14 min, 95% confidence interval [−50.57, −21.71], p < 0.001. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that CAS is shortening the operative time and ischemia time for mandibular/maxillary reconstruction. It also leads to a reduction in hospitalization. Additionally, CAS seems to shorten the preoperative planning time for orthognathic surgery.
