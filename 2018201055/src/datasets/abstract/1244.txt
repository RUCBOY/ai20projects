The continual management of pest species and their preventative elimination is an ongoing, labour-intensive problem. Bait stations are pivotal in this management process as they are the point of contact between the rodents and the process, since the rodents need to enter the bait stations to consume the poisoned bait. Monitoring of these bait stations provides feedback of the effectiveness of the management process. However, there is a significantly large cost associated with periodically sending pest control experts to check the level of bait in the bait stations. This becomes even more apparent over a large geographical area. In this paper we present a method of reducing the labour component associated with regular bait level monitoring by placing a camera in the bait stations and using machine vision to provide an estimate of the amount of bait remaining and the type of bait in the station. Images of four common bait types were captured under provided artificial light in a closed bait station, and the computer vision algorithms proved effective in identifying the type of bait as well as providing an estimate of the bait level.
