Praise enhances motor performance; however, the underlying feedback pathway is unknown. Here, we hypothesized that the social evaluation feedback to the motor system is modified by the top-down effect of the social contingency valuation system, such as the anterior rostral medial prefrontal cortex (arMPFC). We developed a pseudo-interactive task that simplified a conversational student-teacher interaction and conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging study with 33 participants (13 men, 20 women; mean age = 21.7 years; standard deviation = 2.0 years). The participant inside the scanner uttered the pseudo-English word to the English teacher outside the scanner. The teacher provided feedback of acceptance or rejection by either gestures or words, through video. As a control condition, the pseudo-word was read aloud by a computer. Approval from the teacher enhanced the participants’ pleasure rate. Feedback to the participants’ utterance, either rejection or acceptance, activated the arMPFC. Irrespective of the preceding utterance by self or computer, acceptance compared with rejection activated the right primary visual cortex (V1), and the reverse activated the left V1. This valence-dependent laterality of V1 activation indicates that the effect is not the domain-general modulation of visual processing. Instead, the early visual cortices are part of the valence-specific representation of the social signal. Physio-physiological interaction analysis with the seed regions in the right and left V1 and the modulator region in the arMPFC showed enhanced connectivity with the bilateral primary motor cortex. These findings indicate that the socially contingent, self-relevant signals from others act as feedback to the motor control system, and this process is mediated by the early visual cortex.
