A noteworthy application pertaining to the photonic memory is disclosed in the present research. The suggested application is made with the help of silicon monoxide based on three-dimensional photonic structures. Further, the principle of operational mechanism deals with the analysis of absorption, reflection, and transmission where the photonic bandgap analysis of the proposed 3D structure is a backend of the same. Moreover, the signal of 1000 nm is considered as input one where the signal of 400 nm is chosen as an excited one to realize the above said memory application. Finally, the outcomes of the current research would be a worthwhile element for future application and it could be utilized in the optical computer system.
