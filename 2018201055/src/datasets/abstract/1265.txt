This paper proposes the numerical simulations of soft modes of an magnetic domain wall induced by current in a compressed nanowire. We model the Hamiltonian of a nanowire by studying the variations of the parameters with spin-orbit coupling and axial magnetic field. We simulate the variation of chemical potential versus the density of states with spin orbit coupling energy along with Zeeman strength with respect to the energy density. Further we also study of tight binding parameter with spin-orbit coupling energy. Band structure of compressed nanowire is obtained along with simulation of three dimensional electron density and transmission and current density factors. Throughout the manuscript we investigate and make a experimental design of device physics, device characteristics and logical architecture of nanowire required to develop multiple-bit per single cell memory, utilized in high performance computing and vision systems. Using GPU accelerated Micromagnetic framework we simulate the stapled domain wall in a compressed region.
