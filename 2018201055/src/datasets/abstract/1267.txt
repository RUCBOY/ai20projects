The study explored the impact of Please Go Bring Me-COnceptual Model-based Problem Solving (PGBM-COMPS) computer tutoring system on multiplicative reasoning and problem solving of students with learning disabilities. The PGBM-COMPS program focused on enhancing the multiplicative reasoning and problem solving through nurturing fundamental mathematical ideas and moving students above and beyond the concrete level of operation. This is achieved by taking advantages of the constructivist approach from mathematics education and explicit conceptual model-based problem solving approach from special education. Participants were three elementary students with learning disabilities (LD). A mixed method design was employed to investigate the effect of the PGBM-COMPS program on enhancing students’ multiplicative reasoning and problem solving. It was found that the PGBM-COMPS program significantly improved participating students’ problem solving performance not only on researcher developed criterion tests but also on a norm-referenced standardized test. Qualitative and quantities data from this study indicate that, in addition to nurturing fundamental concept of composite units, it is necessary to help students to understand underlying problem structures and move toward mathematical model-based problem representation and solving for generalized problem solving skills.
