The Internet of Things (IoT) has developed an industrial and medical application in dramatic growth in recent years. Narrow Band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a wireless communication and low power wide area technology based on new IoT devices and enables various services to grow. NB-IoT communication significantly increases the power consumption of user equipment, computer capacity, and spectrum performance. Network communication is complex, and the amount of information these networks have made it extremely difficult to manage the transmissions. Since the communication network failure is inevitable, rapid detection, identification, and recovery are the most reliable; it is essential to the high-speed operation. Narrow Band-IoT (NB-IoT) networking technology has proposed the idea of detecting network communication fault. The NB-IoT technique can help save a lot of energy by significantly reducing the number of retransmission required. The proposed technology proves that this research is a powerful proposition for achieving the ideal energy potential. Performance analysis and simulation results show that the detection mechanism can improve transmission efficiency and effectively reduce network communication failures power consumption.
