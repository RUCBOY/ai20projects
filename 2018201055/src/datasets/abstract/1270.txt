Titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V) is characterized with excellent mechanical properties, which makes it suitable for many industrial applications. However, the poor rate of machinability mitigates the use of titanium alloy (Ti6Al4V). This study highlight the various methods to improve the machinability and surface finish of titanium alloy. These methods include; the use of PCD and PCBN tools, cooling systems, process optimization as well as the design and selection of the proper geometry for the cutting tool. The Computer Aided Design, modelling and simulation as well as the Finite Element Analysis of the milling process of Ti6Al4V was carried out using Solidworks 2016. The physical experiments were conducted on a DMU80monoBLOCK Deckel Maho 5-axis CNC milling with the stationary dynamometer (KISTLER 9257A 8-Channel Summation of Type 5001A Multichannel Amplifier) mounted directly to the machine table and the work piece screwed to it. The milling operations was carried out with different combination of cutting parameters while the values of the cutting force for each of the experimental trial was collected through the Data Acquisition System (DAS) connected to the computer. The results obtained show that the process parameters affect the magnitude of the cutting force significantly which in turn affects the rate of material removal. This work finds application in the manufacturing industry as it provides in depth understanding of the machining characteristics and behaviour of titanium alloy.
