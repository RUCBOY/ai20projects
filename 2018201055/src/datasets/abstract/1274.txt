The concept of artificial intelligence (AI) was born in the mid-twentieth century to describe endeavours in computer science focusing on the simulation of human learning. Since then, advances in computing, data collection and data storage have made AI an increasingly important area for researchers and practitioners across a range of disciplines in business and the social sciences. Despite that, there appears to be very few attempts at cataloging and condensing prior research in this area. As such, this paper uses the VOSViewer data visualizer to determine the major authors in the field and to identify themes and concepts emanating from prior research.
