Fatigue crack initiation sites (FCISs) are crucial for fatigue investigations in metallic compounds, since they are closely related to the fatigue failure mechanisms and inform methods against crack initiation. However, the identification of FCISs requires professional knowledge and can be demanding and time consuming. Computer vision techniques show excellent performance for image texture recognition tasks and have been applied to some material domains. In order to explore more possibilities and widen the applications of computer vision techniques on material domains, as well as reduce the labor and knowledge requirements for FCISs recognition tasks, a state-of-the-art object detector â€“ deeply supervised object detector which can train models from scratch, was introduced. The models trained from limited data show reasonable capacity for recognizing FCISs. Results demonstrate that increasing training dataset size can improve the accuracies of the models, while raising the number of epochs can result in a superior ability to recognize delicate features. Moreover, most of the images that cannot be recognized for FCISs possess common characteristics, such as, poor image quality, unclear features, insufficient training data and etc. Based on the above findings, several proposals are made for the future work to improve the performance of the same or relevant studies, as a reference.
