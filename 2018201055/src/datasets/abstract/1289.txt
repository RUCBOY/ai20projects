In this digital era, transmitting data through a computer network has become common. Moreover, some applications have also been developed to do it. Nevertheless, users may not be aware of the security aspect of this data transmission, which can lead to disclosing this private message. In a case when a sensitive message is the object to transmit, a security mechanism should be applied. Data hiding is one of the methods introduced to work for this issue. In this algorithm, the message is embedded into the cover, such as an audio file, before being transmitted; on the other side, the recipient extracts it. However, the size of the message and the quality of the resulted stego data are still challenging. In this paper, we focus on these two problems by considering some factors: embedding space, embedding process, reducing, and smoothing steps. Firstly, the audio signal is discretized to obtain audio samples. Next, these samples are interpolated to provide spaces for hiding the secret. Considering that the quality of the generated stego audio is likely to drop, reducing and smoothing steps are designed. The experimental results show that this approach can improve the quality of the stego based on the specified payload capacity. That is, there is an increase in PSNR value of at least 10 dB, depending on the payload size and the methods.
