Pulmonary emphysema is a condition characterized by the destruction and permanent enlargement of the alveoli of the lungs. The destruction of gas-exchanging alveoli causes shortness of breath followed by a chronic cough and sputum production. A Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) framework for diagnosing pulmonary emphysema from chest Computed Tomography (CT) slices has been designed and implemented in this study. The process of implementing the CAD framework includes segmenting the lung tissues and extracting the regions of interest (ROIs) using the Spatial Intuitionistic Fuzzy C-Means clustering algorithm. The ROIs that were considered in this work were emphysematous lesions — namely, centrilobular, paraseptal, and bullae that were labelled by an expert radiologist. The shape, texture, and run-length features were extracted from each ROI. A wrapper approach that employed four bio-inspired algorithms — namely, Moth–Flame Optimization (MFO), Firefly Optimization (FFO), Artificial Bee Colony Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization — with the accuracy of the support vector machine classifier as the fitness function was used to select the optimal feature subset. The selected features of each bio-inspired algorithm were trained independently using the Extreme Learning Machine classifier based on the tenfold cross-validation technique. The framework was tested on real-time and public emphysema datasets to perform binary classification of lung CT slices of patients with and without the presence of emphysema. The framework that used MFO and FFO for feature selection produced superior results regarding accuracy, precision, recall, and specificity for the real-time dataset and the public dataset, respectively, when compared to the other bio-inspired algorithms.
