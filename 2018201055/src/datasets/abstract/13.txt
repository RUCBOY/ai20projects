We demonstrated a method for computer-generated holograms fabricated by using a femtosecond Bessel beam. A high-efficiency point-by-point process was used to fabricate a longitudinal modified array with a period of 10 μm and a modified area with diameter of approximately 1.5 μm on transparent glass. Tuning the modified length of each area by changing the relative positions of the Bessel beam and sample allowed the phase profile of the incident light to be flexibly adjusted to generate an arbitrary far-field pattern. The approach was verified by inscribing a designed phase hologram in borosilicate glass. Twin images were eliminated by high-level modulation.
