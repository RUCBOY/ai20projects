Nowadays, new “digital” area contain in many novel image and video applications and novel technologies in different fields, such as wireless communication, biology, medicine, engineering, and entertainment. The images and videos are compressed, transmitted, captured, and stored in various digital forms, with different types and amounts of impair artifacts at the same time wireless applications, speckle noise and coding artifacts are most common, in the entertainment and engineering applications, the digital coding and transmission artifacts are considered as dominant. This Special Issue is committed to video quality assessment, available bandwidth of the transmission medium and improvement techniques and systems which are aimed for currently challenging applications in which the visual quality is important in computer communication. In this paper, we propose a novel solution to this problem, which we refer to as a Rate Control (RC) scheme in H.264. The Rate Control scheme controls the rate of compression ratio. The level of compression is decided with the help of rate controller scheme. This scheme measures the quality of the transmitted video and available Bandwidth with the proposed technique; we can build a quality multimedia content and transfer over the transmitter. Simulation results show that our protocol achieves efficient video compression in terms of PSNR when compared with other in achieving quality of video in communication while maintaining the quality multimedia content. Video compression is a challenging one for computer communication and other related network communication to improve the Quality of Service in encoder and decoder applications field.
