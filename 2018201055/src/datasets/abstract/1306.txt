Quantitative analysis of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data in human brain pathology is important in terms of research and clinical practice. This MRI image contains Gaussian noise. Hence, it is hard to analyze and reduce the noise in previous reach work. Recent studies have proposed various image noise reduction algorithms. For brain tumor detection in image processing, noise reduction is not enough in the prediction of brain tumor disease, also it is difficult to analyze the accurate results. The purpose of this work is to develop an effective (Very Large-Scale Integration) VLSI system through which doctors can diagnose, predict certain brain disease and evaluate easily. The proposed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm offers brain disease recognition and classification tool based on MRI images in this system. The VLSI system is implemented on an FPGA because it reconfigures with a real-time solution and provides reprogrammable flexibility. To evaluate performance measurement, the system is processed in the platform of Xilinx, PSNR, and MSE. Calculations are used for medical brain MRI images with different noise levels and are similar to injection methods. This model is run on a simulation model by Xilinx ISE for Virtex-4 FPGAs.
