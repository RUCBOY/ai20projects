Blockchain technology has a tendency to make revolutionary changes for all walks of life with its public, distributed, decentration and unforgeable characteristics. However, with the rapid development of the quantum computer, many extant cryptographic algorithms applied in blockchain-enabled systems are vulnerable to the quantum attacks. In this paper, an anti-quantum blind signature scheme based on the lattice assumption has been proposed. As lattice cryptography is the main candidate algorithm in post-quantum cryptosystems and the blind signature scheme is widely used in e-cash and voting for creating untraceable payment system, which are more suitable for privacy preserving in blockchain-enabled systems. In the proposed scheme, the bimodal Gaussian distribution, Reject sampling and other technologies have been used to improve the security and efficiency. Then, the proposed blind signature can satisfy the properties of blindness and one-more unforgeability, and it also can prove to be safe in the random oracle model. Moreover, the efficiency analysis and comparison results show that the proposed scheme is more efficient than the similar literatures and has a more stabilized signature size than other cryptosystems.
