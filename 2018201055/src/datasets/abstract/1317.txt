The therapeutic strategy that gives consideration to the combination of photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy, has emerged as a potential development of effective anti-cancer medicine. Nevertheless, co-delivery of photosensitizers (PSs) and chemotherapeutic drugs in traditional carriers still remains great limitations due to low drug loadings and poor biocompatibility. Herein, we have utilized a computer-aided strategy to achieve a desired carrier-free self-delivery of pyropheophorbide a (PPa, a common PS) and podophyllotoxin (PPT, a classical chemotherapeutic drug) for synergistic cancer therapy. First, the computational simulation method identified the similar molecular sizes and rigid molecular structures between two drugs molecules. Based on the molecular docking, the intermolecular interactions were found to include π-π stackings, hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. Next, both drugs could co-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) via one-step nanoprecipitation method. The various spectral experiments (UV, IR and FL) were conducted to evaluate the formation mechanism of spherical NPs. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments systematically demonstrated that PPT/PPa NPs not only showed better cellular uptake efficiency, stronger cytotoxicity and higher accumulation in tumor sites, but also exhibited synergistic antitumor effect in female BALB/C bearing-4T1 tumor mice. Such a computer-aided design strategy of chem-photodynamic drugs self-delivery systems pave the way for efficient synergistic cancer therapy.
