Although the application of computer mouse sensors as optical flow recorders in mobile robot odometry holds great promise, it is still hampered by inconsistent performance of the sensors in measuring displacements of the robot on different floor surfaces. This issue can be overcome by a re-calibration of the sensitivity of the sensor measurement when the robot moves on a new type of surface. With the calibrated figure for the sensitivity of each sensor, the positions and orientations of the sensors on the robot frame can be derived from the sensor readings of a set of constrained displacements of the robot. Sensitivity, position and orientation of each sensor are the key parameters in the conversion from the optical flow measured by the sensors, into an estimated displacement of the robot. To minimize the occurrence of systematic errors in this conversion, it is essential to calibrate these parameters as accurately as possible.
This paper proposes a novel procedure to perform their calibration based on a micro-controller setup that implements strict synchronization of the acquisition of optical flow data from all mouse sensors. Execution of the procedure is simple and requires no more than one measurement with a yardstick to obtain the calibrated figures for all key parameters. The collected data set can also be used to verify the calibration with a position calculation. The observed inaccuracy of the calculated location represents an excellent benchmark to compare the performance of different robot localization systems. The efficacy of the calibration method is experimentally tested and validated in a number of calibration scenarios.
