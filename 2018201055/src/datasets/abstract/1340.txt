Digit symbol substitution test (DSST), which is a valid and sensitive tool to assess human cognitive dysfunction, has been widely used in clinical neuropsychology. Although several versions of DSST are currently available, most of the existing DSST versions rely on examinees' intact motor function. This limits their utility in severely motor-impaired individuals. A brain-computer interface (BCI) version of DSST was implemented in this study. Steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) was adopted to build the BCI. Nine symbols in the proposed SSVEP BCI-based DSST were designed with clearly different shapes for decreasing measurement errors due to misidentified symbols. To reduce practice effect, furthermore, the digit-symbol pairs of each trial were different. A two-target SSVEP BCI was designed to judge whether the digit-symbol probe in the center of the user interface matched one of the nine digit-symbol pairs above the user interface. All 12 examinees were able to perform the tasks using the proposed SSVEP BCI-based DSST with 96.17 ± 4.18% averaged accuracy, which was comparable with that of computerized DSST. Furthermore, for examinees participating in both offline and online experiment, the accuracies of the online and offline experiments were comparable, supporting that the proposed BCI-DSST was reliable for repeatedly evaluating examinees’ cognitive function over time. These results verified that the proposed SSVEP BCI-based DSST was feasible and effective for healthy subjects.
