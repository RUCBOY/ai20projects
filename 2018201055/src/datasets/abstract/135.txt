Bifilm defects have been proposed to be critical for the generation of various metallurgical defects in castings and have been reported to exist in various composition-based alloys. However, the geometry structure of bifilm defects has not yet been well understood. This present work reconstructed the bifilm defects in a nickel-aluminium bronze alloy casting in three-dimensional (3D) space through the use of computer tomography technology. It was shown that the shape of the bifilm defects is very complex and different from a spherical defect in 3D space. The bifilm defects were experimentally extracted successfully by an electrolysis method and were imaged, which confirmed the folded double-layer structure of the bifilm defects. These results will shed new light on the understanding of bifilm defects and improve the defect control engineering of castings.
