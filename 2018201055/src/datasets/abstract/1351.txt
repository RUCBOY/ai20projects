The goal of this paper is to advertise the method of gauge transformations (aka holographic reduction, reparametrization) that is well-known in statistical physics and computer science, but less known in combinatorics. As an application of it we give a new proof of a theorem of A. Schrijver asserting that the number of Eulerian orientations of a d–regular graph on n vertices with even d is at least dd∕22d∕2n. We also show that a d–regular graph with even d has always at least as many Eulerian orientations as (d∕2)–regular subgraphs.
