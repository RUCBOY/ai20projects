This paper overviews the enablers and phases for translational cyberinfrastructure for data-driven applications. In particular, it summarizes the translational process of and the lessons learned from the development of the NSF WIFIRE cyberinfrastructure. WIFIRE is an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for real-time data fusion and data-driven simulation, prediction, and visualization of wildﬁre behavior. WIFIRE’s real-time data products and modeling services are routinely accessed by fire research and emergency response communities for modeling as well as the public for situational awareness. In this paper, WIFIRE’s approach to community-integrated innovation, product development and operationalization is described. Existing sustainability efforts and public/private partnerships as a result of this demand is also discussed.
