Background and Objective:Hepatocellular ballooning is an important histological parameter in the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and it is considered to be a morphological pattern that indicates the severity and the progression to cirrhosis and liver-related deaths. There remains uncertainty about the pathological criteria for evaluating the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in liver biopsies. We introduce persistence images as novel mathematical descriptors for the classification of ballooning degeneration in the pathological diagnosis. Methods:We implemented and tested a topological data analysis methodology combined with linear machine learning techniques and applied this to the classification of tissue images into NAFLD subtypes using Matteoni classification in liver biopsies. Results:Digital images of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained specimens with a pathologistâ€™s visual assessment were obtained from 79 patients who were clinically diagnosed with NAFLD. We obtained accuracy rates of more than 90% for the classification between NASH and non-NASH NAFLD groups. The highest area under the curve from the receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.946 for the classification of NASH and NAFL2 (type 2 of Matteoni classification), when both 0- and 1-dimensional persistence images were used. Conclusions:Our methodology using persistent homology provides quantitative measurements of the topological features in liver biopsies of NAFLD groups with considerable accuracy.
