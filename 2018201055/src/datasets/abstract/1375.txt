Skin mountable electronic devices are in a high-speed development at the crossroads of materials science, electronics, and computer science. Sophisticated functions, such as sensing, actuating, and computing, are integrated into a soft electronic device that can be firmly mounted to any place of human body. These advanced electronic devices are capable of yielding abilities for us whenever they are needed and even expanding our abilities beyond their natural limitations. Despite the great promise of skin mounted electronic devices, they still lack satisfactory power supplies that are safe and continuous. This Perspective discusses the prospects of the development of energy storage devices for the next generation skin mountable electronic devices based on their unique requirements on flexibility and miniaturized size.
