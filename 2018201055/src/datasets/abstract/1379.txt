A number of powerful tools have been developed for process simulation, optimization, and design. However, the current software in Process Systems Engineering is mainly focused on processes without consideration of controller design or validation. Therefore, there is always a demand for integrated platforms for solving various process design and control problems. In this paper, an integrated software, ProCACD, developed for solution and analysis of control related problems is presented. Embedded within the software architecture are process design methods, analysis methods, integrated tools, and a library of process models that allow users to study a wide range of problems. With ProCACD, users can solve problems involving generation of process models, steady-state and/or dynamic simulations, analysis of process dynamics in open-loop and/or closed-loop, design of the controller structure, and solving integrated process-control design problems. The application of the software-tool is highlighted through four examples that illustrate the use of features available in ProCACD.
