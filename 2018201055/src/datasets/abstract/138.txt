With the rapid development of technologies such as communications, embedded computing, and sensors, wireless sensor network technology has become more mature and its applications have become more and more extensive. The development of technology has brought great convenience to people's lives and work. At the same time, people's activity and exercise are greatly reduced, causing health problems such as physical weakness. In this regard, designing a research based on wireless sensors to measure human walking and running is of great significance to promote the development of people's physical health. This paper presents a design scheme for human exercise energy consumption detection, researches and designs the coordinator, router node and host computer monitoring system of wireless sensor network. In the human motion energy consumption detection system implemented in this paper, the communication effect between the coordinator and the router node is good, and there are fewer problems such as node loss and data loss. The host computer monitoring interface is simple and easy to operate, easy to use, and can run stably. This solution does not need wiring, reduces the point of failure, reduces the cost, and has good scalability, laying a foundation for the further development of the human motion detection system, and has a wide range of application prospects and practical values. This paper is based on two constant beam width algorithms to carry out the experimental research on the energy consumption of human walking and running, and analyze the results of the energy consumption experiment. Experimental results show that the two constant beamwidth beamforming algorithms have relatively good constant beamwidth effect, which basically verifies the correctness of the theoretical analysis results and can be applied to target noise measurement.
