From the rapid production of prototypes to the customizable manufacture of products, 3D printing (or additive manufacturing) is seen as a manufacturing representative in the fourth industrial revolution. As a result, it is not a technology that can be ignored by any country considering rapid technological advancements. As the industrial benefits of the technology are still novel, developing countries like Nigeria have a chance to embrace it. The growth of 3D printing in Nigeria is expected to impact, not only the area of manufacturing but also the education sector. This technology brings to light, a set of skills lacking in the Nigerian industrial setting, and the opportunity for new teaching practices in science and engineering programs. It has the rare advantage of applying to anyone with a basic understanding of Computer-Aided Design. This can range from senior secondary school students to university students and professionals. This study will evaluate the necessity of introducing 3D printing to science and engineering education in Nigeria and propose feasible adoption strategies.
