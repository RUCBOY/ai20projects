This scientific communication investigates the logic interface of a CAM solver, i.e., MasterCAM, into a Virtual Reality (VR) environment. This integration helps in displaying machining operations in virtual reality. Currently, to partially visualize the results of a simulation in an immersive environment, an import/export procedure must be done manually. Here, a software plugin integrated into IC.IDO (by ESI Group) has been realized and fully described. This application allows the complete integration of CAM solver into the VR environment. In particular, the VERICUT solver has been integrated into VR. This kind of integration has never been done yet.
