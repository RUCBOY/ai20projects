Graphs have become increasingly popular in modeling structures and interactions in a wide variety of problems during the last decade. Graph-based clustering and semi-supervised classification techniques have shown impressive performance. This paper proposes a graph learning framework to preserve both the local and global structure of data. Specifically, our method uses the self-expressiveness of samples to capture the global structure and adaptive neighbor approach to respect the local structure. Furthermore, most existing graph-based methods conduct clustering and semi-supervised classification on the graph learned from the original data matrix, which doesnâ€™t have explicit cluster structure, thus they might not achieve the optimal performance. By considering rank constraint, the achieved graph will have exactly c connected components if there are c clusters or classes. As a byproduct of this, graph learning and label inference are jointly and iteratively implemented in a principled way. Theoretically, we show that our model is equivalent to a combination of kernel k-means and k-means methods under certain condition. Extensive experiments on clustering and semi-supervised classification demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
