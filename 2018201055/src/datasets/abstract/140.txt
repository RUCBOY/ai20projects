Parkinson’s disease (PD) is commonly characterized by several motor symptoms, such as bradykinesia, akinesia, rigidity, and tremor. The analysis of patients’ fine motor control, particularly handwriting, is a powerful tool to support PD assessment. Over the years, various dynamic attributes of handwriting, such as pen pressure, stroke speed, in-air time, etc., which can be captured with the help of online handwriting acquisition tools, have been evaluated for the identification of PD. Motion events, and their associated spatio-temporal properties captured in online handwriting, enable effective classification of PD patients through the identification of unique sequential patterns. This paper proposes a novel classification model based on one-dimensional convolutions and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (BiGRUs) to assess the potential of sequential information of handwriting in identifying Parkinsonian symptoms. One-dimensional convolutions are applied to raw sequences as well as derived features; the resulting sequences are then fed to BiGRU layers to achieve the final classification. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on the PaHaW dataset and achieved competitive results on the NewHandPD dataset.
