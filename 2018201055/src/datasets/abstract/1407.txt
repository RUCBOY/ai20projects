India produces over two million engineering graduates a year as well as another million graduates in related fields such as computer science, biotechnology etc. Employers cite new graduates lack communication skills, problem solving skills and technical skills. The Indian Information Technology (IT) sector has fast changing technical requirements and understanding its requirement is very important for academics and professional trainers so that they can better prepare students with relevant skills. In this paper, we have developed a simple methodology to analyse the requirements of the Indian IT industry by parsing their job portals and extracting information from their job descriptions. We selected the top 10 IT companies by market cap to conduct our analysis. We extracted the number of jobs that contained each keywords like Java, CCNA, SAP, Agile and computed the popularity of each skill and ranked them accordingly. We find that IT industry requires software and skills like Java, Python, SQL are covered by most universities but paid and in demand commercial software tools like SAP, Oracle are not part of the curriculum. This methodology can also track the evolution of skills and predict new skills that can become popular in Industries in the future.
