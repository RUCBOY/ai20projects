Technological advances are changing how forensic laboratories operate in all forensic disciplines, not only digital. Computers support workflow management, enable evidence analysis (physical and digital), and new technology enables previously unavailable forensic capabilities. Used properly, the integration of digital systems supports greater efficiency and reproducibility, and drives digital transformation of forensic laboratories. However, without the necessary preparations, these digital transformations can undermine the core principles and processes of forensic laboratories. Pertinent examples of problems involving technology that have occurred in laboratories are provided, along with opportunities and risk mitigation strategies, based on the authorsâ€™ experiences. Forensic preparedness concentrating on digital data reduces the cost and operational disruption of responding to various kinds of problems, including misplaced exhibits, allegations of employee misconduct, disclosure requirements, and information security breaches. This work presents recommendations to help forensic laboratories prepare for and manage these risks, to use technology effectively, and ultimately strengthen forensic science. The importance of involving digital forensic expertise in risk management of digital transformations in laboratories is emphasized. Forensic laboratories that do not adopt forensic digital preparedness will produce results based on digital data and processes that cannot be verified independently, leaving them vulnerable to challenge. The recommendations in this work could enhance international standards such as ISO/IEC 17025 used to assess and accredit laboratories.
