The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of framework materials manufactured by dental CAD/CAM systems on complete denture deformation. Four materials were used for the maxillary complete denture framework: fiber-reinforced composite (FRC), nano-zirconia (N–Zr), cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy (CCM), and polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK). The framework materials were prepared using CAD/CAM systems. Six dentures of each material were fabricated, using polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA) as a control. The thickness of the palatal area was 1.0 mm for PMMA and PEEK and 0.5 mm for FRC, N–Zr, and CCM. The denture deformation during occlusal load was monitored using four rosette strain gauges placed on the midline of the denture. The maximum principal strain (MPS) of each gauge, except that at the labial frenum, increased proportionally with increasing applied load. The directions of MPS were predominantly perpendicular to the midline of the denture. When a 200-N load was applied, the MPS at the incisive papilla in N–Zr and CCM was half that of PMMA; there was no significant difference among MPSs of PEEK, PMMA and FRC. The MPS at the end point of the denture in FRC, N–Zr, and CCM was significantly smaller than that of PMMA. The MPSs of the complete denture decreased when the CAD/CAM fabricated framework was used. The effects of the CAD/CAM fabricated framework on complete denture deformation varied due to the material used; however, a CAD/CAM fabricated framework material is considered to be effective for reducing complete denture deformation.
