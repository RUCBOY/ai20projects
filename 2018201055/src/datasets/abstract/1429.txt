This work is devoted to the study of application of new topologies in the design of networks-on-chip (NoCs). It is proposed to use two-dimensional optimal circulant topologies for NoC design, and it is developed an optimized routing algorithm with the decreased memory usage. The proposed routing algorithm was compared with TableÂ routing, Clockwise routing, and Adaptive routing algorithms, previously developed for ring circulant topologies, and specialized routing algorithm for multiplicative circulants. The results of synthesis of routers implementing proposed routing algorithms are presented. The cost of ALM and register resources for the implementation of communication subsystems in NoCs with circulant topologies is estimated.
