In the present work, for the first time, a series of unique zinc-centered metal–organic films with high anti-corrosion potency was fabricated on the steel surface through the covalent/non-covalent bonding/interactions between the natural flavonoid based-molecules (Quercetin) and Zn2+/Fe2+ metal-cations. The visualized steel surface micro-scale microstructure by FE-SEM proved that the Quercetin:Zn based metal–organic film covered the metallic surface significantly. Also, the elemental analysis of the protected surfaces via GIXRD, EDS, and mapping experiments illustrated that the metal–organic compounds sufficiently adsorbed. Tafel curves achievements depicted that the Quercetin:Zn based metal–organic film could efficiently protect the iron surface via both O2 reduction/Fe oxidation mechanisms and the outcomes indicated that in the presence of Quercetin (200 ppm):Zn (600 ppm) inhibitors the most protective film against chloride solution was attained (97% efficiency) after 24 h of iron exposure. Additionally, the theoretically derived outcomes applying MC/MD modeling associated with DFT calculations ascertained the interactions followed by adsorption of complexes over the M-Steel.
