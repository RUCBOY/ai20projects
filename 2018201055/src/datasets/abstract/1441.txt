Due to the rapid progress of artificial intelligence, computer science, sensor technology, and other related disciplines, multiprocessor control systems can effectively improve the computing power of controllers and meet robot control performance. However, the amount of information storage and data is very large, and it is difficult to achieve centralized storage of resources. Therefore, it is necessary to use the continuous advancement of video digitization technology and storage technology to effectively solve the problems of multimedia storage, long-distance transmission, and sharing of courseware. Based on this, this paper studies the robotic multiprocessor control system of digital media based on BS structure, which can effectively reduce the bandwidth pressure and conflicts of the interconnected network and memory, and overcome the bottleneck caused by the performance of the multiprocessor system. The actual operation proves that the robot can improve the computing power of the controller and meet the needs of the robot's control performance.
