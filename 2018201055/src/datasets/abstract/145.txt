An orbital fracture is a traumatic injury to the bone in the eye socket. These fractures modify the orbital bone dimensions and the functioning of the intraorbital contents. In this study, a surgical method that includes positioning, aligning and fixing implants to restore orbital fractures was adapted. Notably, it is difficult to achieve an original three-dimensional orbital shape through the process of forming and cutting implants; however, this problem was solved by creating customized implants using computed tomography (CT) images of the patient. The objective of this work is to reconstruct the damaged orbital floor defects by means of a 3D printed implant and restore the orbital floor to its original shape. A case study of an orbital fracture has been included in this study. CT images were used to create a computer-aided design (CAD) model of orbital floor implants, which were designed to maintain orbital floor symmetry from right to left and vice versa. Furthermore, the designed implants were manufactured through a material extrusion process with biocompatible material. The application of the material extrusion process with biocompatible material resulted in the fabrication of implants at a minimal cost. Therefore, the customized models used in the patientâ€™s intra-operation can minimize the operational time and maximize surgical safety.
