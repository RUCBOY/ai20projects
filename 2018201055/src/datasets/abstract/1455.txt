In the field of computer science involving with the huge amount of role in artificial intelligence, the recent improvements in this have provided various effective solutions for the problems being solved by the human in the todayâ€™s world. The main aim of this paper is to describe the recognition of handwritten characters for the ease use of it by using the various machine learning algorithms. This paper involves with the use of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms to provide the betterment of result in the form of accuracy level. Algorithms such as Random forest, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithms are compared to provide its efficiency with the result comparison. Out of all the above mentioned algorithms, KNN seems to provide the better accuracy of around 98%.
