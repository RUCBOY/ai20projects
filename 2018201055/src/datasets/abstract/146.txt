Advantages of Physically Uncloneable Functions (PUFs) have led to appearing a substantial number of novel identification and authentication based systems such as Radio frequency identification (RFID), which is expected to replace the conventional bar-code identification system due to its advantages such as real-time recognition of a considerable number of objects. For example, RFID can be used to identify an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) when it is attached with a tag. In this article, we propose a novel anonymous authentication scheme for RFID-enabled UAV applications using Physically Unclonable Functions. Security and the performance analyses demonstrate that our proposed scheme is secure and efficient. Hence, it can be useful for several RFID-based secure application systems.
