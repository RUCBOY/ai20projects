In this paper we describe a single-node, double precision Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the Conjugate Gradient algorithm in the context of Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics. As a benchmark of our proposal we invert numerically the Dirac–Wilson operator on a 4-dimensional grid on three Xilinx hardware solutions: Zynq Ultrascale+ evaluation board, the Alveo U250 accelerator and the largest device available on the market, the VU13P device. In our implementation we separate software/hardware parts in such a way that the entire multiplication by the Dirac operator is performed in hardware, and the rest of the algorithm runs on the host. We find out that the FPGA implementation can offer a performance comparable with that obtained using current CPU or Intel’s many core Xeon Phi accelerators. A possible multiple node FPGA-based system is discussed and we argue that power-efficient High Performance Computing (HPC) systems can be implemented using FPGA devices only.
