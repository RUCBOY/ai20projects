This work presents a new range searching algorithm for multidimensional databases. The proposed methodology is based on the idea of generating a navigation metadata structure, complementary to the database, that eases the navigation between the elements of the database. This metadata structure can be adapted to different problems and it is generated in a one time pre-procesing effort for each database. This work contains a complete description of the algorithm, including a study of its searching performance under different conditions compared with a brute force approach.
