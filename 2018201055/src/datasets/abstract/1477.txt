Graph theory is the most powerful tools in the mathematics and computer science, also study of descriptors in quantitative structure property relationship (QSPR) and quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) studies in the chemistry science. Let G=(V(G),E(G)) be a simple molecular graph without directed and multiple edges and without loops. A topological index is a numerical descriptor of the molecular structure derived from the corresponding molecular graph. There are a lot of topological indices for molecular graphs. Eccentricity-based topological indices such as vertex (-edge) eccentric and modified vertex (-edge) eccentric connectivity indices are very important QSPR/QSAR studies. In this paper, the edge eccentric and modified vertex (-edge) eccentric connectivity indices are computed for the Dutch windmill graph Dmn that represents bidentate ligands. Also, we plotted the two-dimensional graphics of the Dmn with the help of cartesian coordinate system.
