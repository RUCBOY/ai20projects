Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT) is used for the treatment of hepatic tumors. The aim of this retrospective study was to compare two dosimetric approaches based on 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT and 90Y PET/CT, using Simplicit90Y™ versus the supplier suggested method of activity calculation.
A total of 19 patients underwent 21 SIRT after baseline angiography and 99mTc-MAA SPECT/CT, followed by 90Y PET/CT. Overlap between 99mTc-MAA and 90Y-microspheres was quantified with different thresholds isocontours. The perfused volume and tumor absorbed dose were estimated using Simplicit90Y™ based on SPECT/CT and PET/CT, then compared with the supplier suggested method. These data were related to overall survival to evaluate their prognostic impact.
The overlap between PET/CT and SPECT/CT was dependent on thresholds, decreasing with an increasing threshold. The overlap between the 99mTc-MAA and 90Y-microspheres biodistributions versus the tumor distribution on morphological imaging was suboptimal, in particular for small tumor volume. The tumor absorbed dose estimated after 90Y PET/CT was not different from tumor absorbed dose estimated after SPECT/CT. The Perfused lobe absorbed dose was significantly lower while the volume of the perfused lobe was significantly higher when estimated by Simplicit90Y™ compared to the supplier suggested conventional approach. A statistical parameter based on overlap between tumor and 90Y-microspheres distribution as well as tumoral dosimetry was significantly related to the overall survival.
Post-treatment imaging remains paramount to estimate the irradiation dosimetry, due to an imperfect overlap. The perfused volume could be estimated from functional imaging, given its impact on dosimetry. Finally, survival seems related to tumoral overlap and dosimetry.
