The ability to acquire quality learning is always being a very subjective affair of individuals. Every lecture/session spent during the study doesn’t assure complete knowledge transfer between instructors and student. Today’s world focuses more on student-centered learning where the learning aims at a high degree of student engagement with encouragement. This motivates for Institutional Research Project (IRP) initiative, where students are encouraged in self-learning under guidance, with an objective to accomplish a project or task at their own pace of learning under stipulated time, while fostering their interests. A team of students and researchers from the School of Electronics, Computers and Mechanical sciences at KLE Tech are developing an open platform for studying computational algorithms, sensors and electronics, drives and mechanical designs for autonomous or self-driving vehicles under automotive research.
