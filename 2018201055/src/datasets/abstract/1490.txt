Computer networks are broadening day by day and the percentage of an internet user is increasing as well. The technological improvement leads to the security of network is a complex and systematic one. Intrusion detection system represents a substantial layer of protection for networked computers. Methods of data mining have currently received much interest in tackling problems of information security, including intrusion detection. There have been several security frameworks to address this challenge, and there is a scope besides addressing new challenges. To detect intrusion in the network, we suggest a security framework on this. This framework uses Snort for detecting signature based attacks and density based clustering algorithm DBSCAN for detecting anomalies in the network. On this platform, we conduct various experiments in real time and offline simulation for cost-effective analyzes and practical analysis.
