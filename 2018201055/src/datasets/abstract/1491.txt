The first attention model in the computer science community is proposed in 1998. In the following years, human attention has been intensively studied. However, these studies mainly refer human attention as the image regions that draw the attention of a human (outside the image) who is looking at the image. In this paper, we infer the attention of a human inside a third-person view video where the human is doing a task, and define human attention as attentional objects that coincide with the task the human is doing. To infer human attention, we propose a deep neural network model that fuses both low-level human pose cue and high-level task encoding cue. Due to the lack of appropriate public datasets for studying this problem, we newly collect a video dataset in complex Virtual-Reality (VR) scenes. In the experiments, we widely compare our method with three other methods on this VR dataset. In addition, we re-annotate a public real dataset and conduct the extensional experiments on this real dataset. The experiment results validate the effectiveness of our method.
