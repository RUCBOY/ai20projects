This study aims to investigate the impact of learning materials developed with augmented reality (AR) technology on middle school students' achievement and attitudes towards the course, and to determine their attitudes towards AR applications. In this study, a quasi-experimental design was used in which intact classrooms at two different schools, consisting of a total of one hundred 7th grade middle school students, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group completed the “Solar System and Beyond” module of their science course using AR technology, while the control group completed the same module using traditional methods and textbooks. Students in the experimental group were found to have higher levels of achievement and more positive attitudes towards the course than those in the control group. In addition, the results revealed that the students were pleased and wanted to continue using AR applications in the future. They also showed no signs of anxiety when using AR applications. In addition, it was found that academic achievements and attitudes of the students in the experimental group showed a positive, significant and intermediate correlation.
