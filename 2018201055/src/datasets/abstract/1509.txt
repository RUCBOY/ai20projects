Domain theory has a long history of applications in theoretical computer science and mathematics. In this article, we explore the relation of domain theory to probability theory and stochastic processes. The goal is to establish a theory in which Polish spaces are replaced by domains, and measurable maps are replaced by Scott-continuous functions. We illustrate the approach by recasting one of the fundamental results of stochastic process theory – Skorohod's Representation Theorem – in domain-theoretic terms. We anticipate the domain-theoretic version of results like Skorohod's Theorem will improve our understanding of probabilistic choice in computational models, and help devise models of probabilistic programming, with its focus on programming languages that support sampling from distributions where the results are applied to Bayesian reasoning.
