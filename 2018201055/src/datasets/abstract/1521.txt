This work demonstrates an interdisciplinary modeling process between economists and computer scientists to formulate an Agent-Based Model of Land Use and Cover Change (ABM/LUCC). The MR POTATOHEAD (Model Representing Potential Objects That Appear in The Ontology of Human - Environmental Actions & Decisions) generic modeling methodology for ABM/LUCC process building is used to construct the interdisciplinary ABM. In our paper, this methodology is applied to an ABM/LUCC describing a collection of tourist areas that have faced an intense development leading to huge pressure on land prices as well as to land-use conflicts (local residential market, tourist rental investments, agricultural production). The process moves from the conceptual template description, to conceptual model, to its computer model counterpart. The NetLogo Design Pattern is used to efficiently integrate the spatial aspects of the ABM. The paper highlights benefits offered by this software technique of engineering to design modular, extensible and scalable ABM/LUCC computer models. We present preliminary work aiming to better model the dynamical complex system of ABM/LUCC. Preliminary results show that the MR POTATOHEAD modeling process facilitates both interdisciplinary dialogs and computer model formulation. This conceptual template approach facilitates interdisciplinary communication and interaction between economists and computer scientists.
