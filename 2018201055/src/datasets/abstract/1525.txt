Computing the convex hull of a set of points is a fundamental issue in many fields, including geometric computing, computer graphics, and computer vision. This problem is computationally challenging, especially when the number of points is past the millions. In this paper, we propose a fast filtering technique that reduces the computational cost for computing a convex hull for a large set of points. The proposed method preprocesses the input set and filters all points inside a four-vertex polygon. The experimental results showed the proposed filtering approach achieved a speedup of up to 77 and 12 times faster than the standard Graham scan and Jarvis march algorithms, respectively.
