The Science of Science is an emerging field that enables tracking the dynamics of science in the form of birth and death of scientific fields and research trends in them. This study proposes a framework to analyze the content of academic publications to extract research trends and explore their temporal evolution. In this proposed framework, state-of-the-art embedding techniques are reviewed and utilized to consider semantic vectors of publicationsâ€™ keywords, which have been used to produce semantic-based clusters reflecting research trends or sub-fields. We compare our proposed method with LDA, as a baseline method, to demonstrate the explainability of the clusters, applying them to the field of "Artificial Intelligence" (AI) as a case study.
