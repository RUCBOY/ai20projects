Growing energy demand is calling for an effective energy management. In smart homes all devices are connected to Internet by means of Internet of Things. There is a possible means of studying the consumer usage pattern and accordingly forecast their energy demand. Multi Agents has been used in computer science for a long time and applied for lot of applications for replicating the job of human. So towards monitoring and controlling the cyber physical systems, these multi agent system has been applied in smart transportation, smart cities, Smart Grid and so. This paper proposes a Multi-agent System (MAS) for smart energy management in an IoT based system. Inspired by the competition in human societies for accepting best proposals: this work proposes an Agent Negotiation system for demand reduction. The Agents in IoT system negotiate with the meter agent for accepting a proposal which will reduce the peak hour usage. The negotiation agent also negotiates with the meter agent for using energy when the availability of renewables are surplus. This negotiation is done with hundreds and thousands of homes thus helping Utilities to meet the supply-demand effectively. Consumers get the best pricing based on the accepted policies.
