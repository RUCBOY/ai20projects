One of the most important problems in the early years of engineering programs is the difficulty that students have to understand Basic Sciences concepts, their application in technology and, particularly, in engineering. One of the ways to solve this situation is by implementing methodologies that promote an "Active and Student-Centered Learning" (ASCL). There are many techniques to develop this kind of approach, some of them are facilitated and/or enhanced through the use of technology. One of the most developed technologies in recent times and with greater expectations for the near future is Virtual and Augmented Reality (VAR). Our objective with this project is to develop and test VAR applications for improving the understanding of Basic Sciences concepts in freshmen courses.
