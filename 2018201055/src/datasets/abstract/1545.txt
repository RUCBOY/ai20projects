A miniature field meter is described for measuring fair weather electric fields (of magnitude ~100 Vm-1). It is a brushless field mill constructed from machine-cut parts, driven by a computer fan motor. It resolves fair weather fields at ~1 mV per (Vm−1), with a time response of 0.65 s. It implements self-calibration through combining a mechanical shutter with a programmable bipolar calibration electrode. It has a mass of 86 g, dimensions 4 cm × 4 cm x 8 cm and consumes <100 mA at 6 V. This design will facilitate new climate-related measurements using balloons and remotely piloted aircraft.
