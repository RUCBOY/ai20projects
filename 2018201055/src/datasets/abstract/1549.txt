This study aims to test two hypotheses: teaching building information modeling (BIM) in relation to construction science provides students with a remarkable understanding of the nature of construction science (Hypothesis 1), and if the student has positive attitude toward the use of the BIM program, then efficiency by which construction science is taught by its means is improved (Hypothesis 2). Results and process of a case study with a novel teaching methodology were discussed in terms of the benefits of the students. A questionnaire study was conducted on the student group with which the case study was performed to test each student's attitude. Results were evaluated statistically. When BIM is integrated with the teaching of basic construction courses within architecture degree programs, the students understood the building system principles simply and effectively. As a result of the statistical analysis, the students find the applied method effective. Moreover, their attitude toward BIM affects the process.
