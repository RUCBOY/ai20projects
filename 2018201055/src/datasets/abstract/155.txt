Information and communication technology (ICT) literacy represents an essential skill for adolescents to efficiently participate in a modern society. Previous research reported conflicting findings regarding gender differences in ICT literacy. Therefore, the aim of the present study was the exploration of cross-sectional and longitudinal gender effects on ICT literacy across a period of three years among a sample of German 15-year-olds (N = 13,943). The results showed that ICT literacy increased across the study period. Although gender differences in ICT literacy were negligible at age 15, small differences in favor of boys emerged at age 18. In contrast, gender differences in ICT confidence favored boys at age 15 but did not change subsequently. Hypotheses with regard to moderating effects of gender role orientations were not supported. Overall, the study found only small differences in ICT literacy between boys and girls. The small size of the observed effect does not warrant alarming conclusions regarding increasing disadvantages in ICT literacy for girls.
