In this study the authors focused on mental disorders as functional disorders of human consciousness from the viewpoints of cognitive science and information science. They further focused their study on depression, a disorder that is the most frequently seen of mental disorders and whose cause is unclear. The authors propose a model of consciousness for the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder, which is a typical disorder caused by depression. To construct this consciousness model, the authors adopted a consciousness module of their own development called Module of Nerves for Advanced Dynamics or MoNAD.
