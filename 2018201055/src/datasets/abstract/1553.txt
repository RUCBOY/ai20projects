Surveillance systems are most commonly used for monitoring/surveillance of almost all public and private places. Real time behaviour of these systems add extra capacity to the surveillance activity. In such cases, any suspicious or uneven activity is detected by analysing the real time video stream of the cameras through these system. At maximum places, the surveillance activity is more manual, i.e. real time video footage of CCTV is monitored by security personals in some control room. It is difficult for any human being to monitor CCTV continuously and tirelessly without any rest. Therefore, robustness and effectiveness of such surveillance depends on technological strength of security personals, (i.e. human being), and hence pose the need of more man power for round the clock surveillance. This paper discusses a complete autonomous solution that will not only reduce the effort of individuals but will also increase the effectiveness of the law enforcement authority in patrolling the public places of a city. This system is proposed to use the existing CCTV infrastructure of the city. Various computer vision techniques are employed to detect the suspicious activity from real time video sequences. An intricate communication system is also designed to decrease the response time of system for the police authorities. This system is capable to generate an alarm signal if there founds any suspicious fellow or unusual activity in the restricted site. It also generates the complete description related to the events happenings in form of textual warning messages.
