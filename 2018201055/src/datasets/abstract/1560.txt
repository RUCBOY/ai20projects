Regarding the favorable advantages of green inhibitors, there are a number of studies to introduce the inhibition behavior of this type of material to enhance the protection of metals. In the present study, the mild steel substrates are protected in the acidic process by Artichoke as a green corrosion inhibitor. Some professional measurements were chosen for the corrosion inhibitive action evaluation of the Artichoke at various concentrations in the acidic solution. The electrochemical outcomes implied that the Artichoke revealed a superior inhibition action to mild steel. It was demonstrated that the charge transfer resistance of the Artichoke with a higher concentration (1000 ppm) enhanced from ~9.9 Ω. cm2 to ~795.2 Ω. cm2 after 24 h of immersion. The maximum corrosion inhibition efficiency (about 98.7%) and surface coverage (about 76.3%) were obtained in the presence of 1000 ppm Artichoke extract after 24 h immersion. The polarization results also revealed that by the addition of Artichoke extract, the corrosion current density of the mild steel significantly decreased from 6.3 μA/cm2 for the sample without inhibitor to 0.1 μA/cm2 for the sample containing 1000 ppm inhibitor. The Artichoke could effectively protect the steel through physicochemical interaction and film formation to mitigate the serious demolition of cl−. This green corrosion inhibitor is applicable to work out the corrosion obstacles of metallic equipment in the acidic process. Also, the adsorption of anticorrosive chemicals on the substrate was computationally ascertained by molecular/DFT (density functional theory) modelings
