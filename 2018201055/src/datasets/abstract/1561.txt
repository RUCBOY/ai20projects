In this study, we present a perception algorithm that is based purely on vision or camera data. We focus on demonstrating a powerful end-to-end lane detection method using contemporary computer vision techniques for self-driving cars. We first present a minimalistic approach based on edge detection and polynomial regression which is the baseline approach for detecting only the straight lane lines. We then propose an improved lane detection technique based on perspective transformations and histogram analysis. In this latter technique, both straight and curved lane lines can be detected. To demonstrate the superiority of the proposed lane detection approach over the conventional approach, simulation results in different environments are presented.
