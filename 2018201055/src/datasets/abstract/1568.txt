Image analysis must be thoroughly analyzed to find computer-assisted medical assistance. Researchers sought to automate the analysis of image pathology using the segmentation process. Therefore, many researchers have proposed an image pathology classification using different deep learning methods. A comprehensive survey has been carried out to identify the various research articles available in the literature on all types of image pathology and analyze the main contributions and their benefits. Here, a total of fifteen documents are analyzed. In addition, this study provides a detailed idea of how to improve the segmentation performance of the image pathology classification.
