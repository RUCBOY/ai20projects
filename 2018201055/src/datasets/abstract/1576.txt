Merging the citation counts of arXiv-deposited e-prints (arXiv version) with those of their corresponding published journal articles (publisher version) is an important issue in citation analysis. Using examples of arXiv-deposited e-prints, this article adopts a manual approach to investigate the processing methods used by bibliographic repositories such as Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, Astrophysics Data System (ADS), and INSPIRE for the citation merging. Both Google Scholar and ADS consolidate all citations from the two versions into the publisher one, whereas the consolidated citations are accumulated into the arXiv version in the INSPIRE repository. All these methods ignore the categories of the arXiv-deposited versions and the corresponding availability dates. As for Web of Science and Scopus, they count the citations of the two versions separately, which is likely regarding them as two independent articles. Focusing on journal articles that also appeared as arXiv e-prints, we classify them into two categories and identify two public availability dates of articles as the starting point of citation statistics. We present four feasible schemes to consolidate citation counts for the articles with both versions and also propose a universal scheme based on the research output. Furthermore, we investigated 2,662 e-prints in the “Computer Science - Digital Libraries” subject (cs.DL) from 1998 to 2018 in arXiv.org and manually calculated the consolidated citation counts of arXiv-deposited articles with the corresponding citation merging schemes. Furthermore, these citation consolidation methods are applied to the evaluation of articles, authors, and journals. Such empirical testing proves the feasibility of the schemes proposed in this article.
