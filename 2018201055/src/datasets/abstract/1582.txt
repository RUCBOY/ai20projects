Researchers conduct phenomenological studies to better understand the experiences of phenomena. Researchers conducting phenomenological studies use different research methods grounded in philosophical underpinnings. Van Manen's hermeneutic phenomenological human science method is used in understanding phenomena in diverse disciplines. The purpose of the integrative review was to explore and synthesize research to address two questions about the human science method in clinical practice settings.
Wittemore and Knafi (2005)'s method for integrative review was used to explore current literature and summarize the use of human science method. A database search of keywords in peer-reviewed articles published from 2009 to 2019 was reviewed. Eleven key research studies were selected for the integrative literature review. The key studies met the inclusion criteria of phenomenology, nurses, human science method, clinical practice, and van Manen. Researchers used van Manen's human science method as guidelines for collecting and analyzing data about the lived experience of diverse phenomena in clinical practice settings. An understanding of the human science method will guide researchers who conduct research studies using van Manen's approach to phenomenology.
