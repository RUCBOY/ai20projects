Our research group has been studying dissociative identity disorder (DID) with a view to promoting further understanding of advanced mental disorders in humans. We constructed a conscious system using consciousness modules called MoNADs and have been attempting to reproduce dissociation symptoms. Previously, as we reported at the 2018 Annual International Conference on Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architectures (BICA 2018), we incorporated two types of units, a recording device (EXM) and a MoNAD filter value, into our conscious system and attempted to achieve highly reproducible dissociation symptoms and the onset process. In this paper we present the development of our robot science based conscious program, describe various experimental simulations based on this model, and present the results. Finally, from the results of our simulations, we will consider the symptoms of the dissociative disorder group including DID and the reproducibility of the onset process in this consciousness model.
