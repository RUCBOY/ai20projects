APUs (Accelerated Processing Units) are widely available in personal computers as low-cost processors that have a CPU and an integrated GPU for displaying graphics, in the same die. Using a ray tracing algorithm as a computationally intensive workload and taking advantage of the APU specific characteristics, we compare the performance of this SoC against CPU and GPU solutions in the same price range.
