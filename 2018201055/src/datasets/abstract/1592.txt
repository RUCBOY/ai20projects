Quantum teleportation draws our attention to propose a new type of problems which can not be solved using classical computers. In this paper, we propose one of these problems. Concretely, this paper extends the definition of Deutsch’s problem to decide whether a black box Uf applied on a given unknown qubit α|0〉+β|1〉, such that |α|>0,|β|>0,and|α|≠|β|, is constant or balanced Boolean function, besides, estimation of |α| and |β|. Although, this problem is very simple but it can not be solved using classical computers, because qubit can not be implemented physically using classical computers. A novel quantum algorithm based on principle of entanglement measure is proposed to solve this problem. IBMs 5-qubit quantum computer (ibmqx4) is used to realize the proposed algorithm experimentally.
