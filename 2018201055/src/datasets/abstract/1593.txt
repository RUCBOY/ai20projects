The main purpose of science education is to provide students with Science Process Skills (SPS). Participation in scientific inquiry activities is the most effective method in developing these skills. This study uses a mixed-method design to investigate the effect of mobile scientific inquiry on pre-service teachers’ SPS. For this purpose, a mobile application developed by the researchers and used by participants for eight weeks. 94 pre-service teachers participated in the study. “Science Process Skills Test”, semi-structured interviews and reflective journals were the data collection tools of the study. Results showed that engaging mobile scientific inquiry affects development of science process skills significantly and positively. Qualitative data analysis also supported this positive change.
