Smart coaching in martial arts is one of the recent research areas in Human Motion Analysis. Numerous moves are performed incorrectly during the performance. In this paper we offer a system that will record the Playersâ€™ movements using IR (Infrared) camera sensor, store the data in a database, pre-process the data, classify the data using F-DTW (Fast Dynamic Time Warping) and then show the users an accurate report that contains every movement the player had done, their mistakes and how to improve their performance the next time. This approach focuses on the first seven movements of Karate Kata 1 (Hein Shodan). The system has reached an accuracy of 91.07% in classifying the moves and one common mistake for each move.
