Gram-negative bacteria are among the causative microorganisms for zoonotic diseases in humans and teleosts. Outer membrane proteins (Omps) of Aeromonas hydrophila, a gram-negative bacterium, are critical for the subcellular integration to eukaryotic cell that can modulate the functions of macrophages. Hence Omps are recognized as immune markers for the vaccine development.
In the present study, a 3-D model of Omps was identified using in silico technique and recognized through the Swiss model web-server and confirmed with Procheck and ProSA server.. The B-cell binding sites of the protein were selected from sequence alignment.. Further, the identification of B-cell epitope was carried out using modules of BCpred server (i.e., BCPred and Amino Acid Pairs). The identified antigenic amino acid sequences for B-cells were used to determine the T-cell epitope (both MHC I & II allelic binding sequences) using ProPred 1 and ProPred servers.
The epitopic regions (9 mer: LAGKTTNES and GFDGSQYGK) in the Omps that are bound together with the MHC molecules (MHC-I & II), and have maximum possible numbers of MHC alleles are recognized. It was observed that Omps of A. hydrophila are conserved across the serotypes and are immunogenic. These epitopes can stimulate significant immune responses and can be advantageous while preparing peptide-based vaccines against A. hydrophila infections. Thus, suggesting the use of Omps in the development of vaccines and immunotherapeutics against the bacterial diseases in humans and teleosts.
