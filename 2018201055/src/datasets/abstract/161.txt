Role Engineering creates a model for enforcing security among organizations and reduces the risk of entities having unauthorized access privileges. In this paper, we realize the role engineering for the organizations where services are associated with the roles. Access to such services depends on the verification and validation of the role and role ownership. In face to face communication, verification and validation of roles and role ownership are possible through physical certificates but in a computer network, it is spacious. In some cases, it relies on the knowledge-based security systems creating a problem of confidentiality. This research proposed an unconventional Cryptographic Role Engineering (CRE) framework to ensure the privacy and role ownership issues of the entities, secure role management for the role assigning organizations and role validation and verification for the service providing organizations. Validation of the framework is performed through the case study/example scenario and feature analysis. Based on validation and achieved features, it is concluded that the proposed framework achieved the feature of a strong connection between easy administration and strong security. As a result, the role assigning organizations can have a secure role management mechanism, the role owner can provide the proof of role ownership independently and service-providing organizations can verify and validate the role without the intervention of role assigning organizations.
