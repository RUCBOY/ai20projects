This paper presents the numerical results of the study of a turbulent flame of methane enriched with hydrogen/air generated by a cylindrical burner. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code “FLUENT” and “Gambit” were used to perform the numerical simulation of the networking process. The Navier-Stokes equations, which estimate flow using a limited size method, have been resolved. The modeling of the disturbance/chemistry interaction has been used to associate the LES/PDF models with the state of system transfer equations. The calculations were analyzed for axial velocity, temperature, and carbon monoxide emissions. The results of the numerical calculations have been compared and checked for accuracy by returning to experimental data. The combustion behavior of CH4, G222 and H2 was employed by using the aforementioned parameters. The G222 is a mixture consists of 77% of methane and 23% of hydrogen. The obtained results confirm the fact of considering hydrogen as a clean non-polluting fuel compared to methane since it has no carbon monoxide emissions in combustion products. In addition, the velocity of hydrogen gas in the flame was significantly higher than the methane gas velocity.
