Biomineralization research examines structure-function relations in all types of exo- and endo-skeletons and other hard tissues of living organisms, and it relies heavily on 3D imaging. Segmentation of 3D renderings of biomineralized structures has long been a bottleneck because of human limitations such as our available time, attention span, eye-hand coordination, cognitive biases, and attainable precision, amongst other limitations. Since recently, some of these routine limitations appear to be surmountable thanks to the development of deep-learning algorithms for biological imagery in general, and for 3D image segmentation in particular. Many components of deep learning often appear too abstract for a life scientist. Despite this, the basic principles underlying deep learning have many easy-to-grasp commonalities with human learning and universal logic. This primer presents these basic principles in what we feel is an intuitive manner, without relying on prerequisite knowledge of informatics and computer science, and with the aim of improving the reader’s general literacy in artificial intelligence and deep learning. Here, biomineralization case studies are presented to illustrate the application of deep learning for solving segmentation and analysis problems of 3D images ridden by various artifacts, and/or which are plainly difficult to interpret. The presented portfolio of case studies includes three examples of imaging using micro-computed tomography (µCT), and three examples using focused-ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), all on mineralized tissues. We believe this primer will expand the circle of users of deep learning amongst biomineralization researchers and other life scientists involved with 3D imaging, and will encourage incorporation of this powerful tool into their professional skillsets and to explore it further.
