Augmented Reality (AR) has been accepted as an effective learning method which means that it becomes complementary to traditional learning, especially in chemistry. In fact, AR is an interactive experience of a real-world environment. Before recent releases of cheap and affordable smart devices, AR large-scale applications in education were almost impossible. After a brief analysis of current trends in the use of AR, we propose a new system, named ARChemistry Learning, to support the Romanian educational system. In this study, we propose a modern AR tool in the chemistry education used to support children or anyone who wants to learn chemistry, to develop logic, and to explore the world seen only on a smart device. The purpose of this research is to demonstrate how effective these AR applications are, even that in Romania they are still in a pioneering phase.
