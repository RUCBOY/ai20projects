The purpose of this study is to design an epidemic model that portray the exploitation of hardware through embedded tiny chip based mini-computer within another computer such as Intel management engine (ME). The firmware level bugs allow escalation of privileges and remote execution of code beneath the running operating system for infiltration or completely intervene with computer. A mathematical model is presented for vulnerabilities of embedded tiny chip based hardware that portray exploitation and spread of infection in network infrastructures. Disease free and endemic equilibria are analyzed for the designed model in terms of the basic reproduction number R0, as well as global and local stability conditions for integer order scenarios of the system. Numerical experimentations are performed for distinct fractional order terms in the system and the results endorsed that fractional regimes provide enrich dynamics by means of super-fast transients as well as super slow evolutions of the steady-state which are rarely substantiated in integer order counterpart models.
