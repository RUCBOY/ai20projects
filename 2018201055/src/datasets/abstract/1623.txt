An adequate education in a discipline as vast and articulated as wind science and engineering cannot fail to recognize its origins, developments, fundamentals, advancements and prospects. This paper analyses and discusses the actual state of education by identifying its limits, gaps and strengths, as well as the hard core of knowledge that should constitute the common basis for a mature and modern discipline capable of generating figures endowed with broad views and specialized skills. Pursuing this vision in a rational and homogeneous framework, it also points out the role of new strategies aiming to exploit technological evolution and communication systems, to rationalize co-operative educational programs on broad territorial scales, to involve different competences as in-depth as they are varied in the wind science and engineering community. Meanwhile, it highlights the necessity of reaching those who need to establish and consolidate this culture, but do not have the opportunity to personally experience the manifold initiatives in the discipline, to seize the interest of people towards wind science and engineering, to disseminate its culture and know-how into everyday life and society.
