This article examined 12 senior secondary school science teachers’ understandings about the factors associated with students’ science learning in Sri Lanka. Using a qualitative approach, three focus group discussions were conducted with the teachers. Each interview was approximately 60 minutes in duration. Data from the focus group discussions were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Findings suggested that both positive and negative factors influenced students’ science learning. Teachers believed that the most influential factor was the students themselves, followed by the family and the school. In addition, the teachers identified mass media and technology-related, and institution-related factors as influential in students’ science learning. Implications for teachers, schools and educational authorities and suggestions for future research are provided.
