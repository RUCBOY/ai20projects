Healthcare is an area that is supposed to have significant impacts on the blockchain (BC). Nevertheless, researchers and experts in health informatics are researching and developments in the field. Work is very new in the field but is progressively increasing. It can be referred as uprising in the digital world because of its effective performance concerning security, efficacy, and productivity of different frameworks. It operates as a distributed database, exchanged within a decentralized computer network. It stores data of the transactions performed using crypto-currency and information is managed using various computers linked to a peer-to-peer network. Besides, no trusted third parties are required in a distributed e-Health environment and support document removal. Health care is one of the most important aspects that require efficacious technologies to stay up to date and analyze the population's health status so that medical data can be maintained. Thus, in this paper, a broad review is presented that delineates the usage of conventional healthcare systems and also the use of technology to make it e-healthcare. Further, the role of the blockchain is presented in this paper. Although, a plethora of studies have been proposed that included various methodologies of blockchain in the healthcare industry, yet these studies are not enough to portray the effectiveness of these proposed approaches. In the review, different applications of blockchain that are being utilized at the present time are demonstrated along with the benefits and limitations of blockchain. It is observed that there is a scope of research in this field to know to enhance the utility of blockchain in healthcare. Moreover, an ontology-based Adverse Drug event system can be taken into consideration to use it as a BC application.
