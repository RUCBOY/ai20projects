Now the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices can be deployed to monitor the flow of data, the source of collection and supervision on a large scale of complex networks. It implements large networks for sending and receiving data connected by smart devices. Malware threats, which are primarily targeted at conventional computers linked to the Internet, can also be targeted at IoT machines. Therefore, a smart protection approach is needed to protect millions of IIoT users against malicious attacks. On the other hand, existing state-of - the-art malware identification methods are not better in terms of computational complexity. In this paper, we design architecture to detect malware attacks on the Industrial Internet of Things (MD-IIOT). For an in-depth analysis of malware, a methodology is proposed based on color image visualization and deep convolution neural network. The findings of the proposed method are compared to former approaches to malware detection. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method's predictive time and detection accuracy are higher than that of previous machine learning and deep learning methods.
