Nowadays, computer science has the ability of assisting experts in different application areas. Recently there has been increasing attention in the health area, and there exist different approaches based on artificial intelligence that have been proposed in the diagnosis of several kinds of diseases. In particular, fuzzy systems have been successfully used as Diagnosis Systems, in this way helping doctors to realize a faster and more accurate diagnosis. However, with the emergence of Type-2 Fuzzy Systems, there have been important improvements in handling the uncertainty with respect to traditional Fuzzy Systems (now called Type-1 Fuzzy Systems) in different kinds of problems. In the present paper, a new approach to Fuzzy Diagnosis based on Type-2 Fuzzy Systems is proposed and compared with respect to Type-1 Fuzzy Systems on a set of diagnosis problems, in order to evaluate the relevance of the uncertainty handling in this kind of problems. On the other hand, the paper is also aiming at observing the accuracy behavior in Fuzzy Diagnosis Systems by changing the uncertainty level in the models. Finally, a comparison of Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Systems with respect to General Type-2 Fuzzy Systems for a set of diagnosis problems is presented.
