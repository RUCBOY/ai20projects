The study of soliton interaction is helpful to improve the quality and capacity of computer image processing. In this paper, using the computerized symbolic computation, the analytical two-soliton solutions are obtained by the Hirota bilinear method. Through choosing different parameters, the influences of them on soliton interactions are discussed. Interactions between solitons propagating in different directions are analyzed. Results are beneficial to the effective transmission of information in the optical coherence tomography system.
