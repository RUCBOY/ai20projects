Free-viewpoint video (FVV) is processed video content in which viewers can freely select the viewing position and angle. FVV delivers an improved visual experience and can also help synthesize special effects and virtual reality content. In this paper, a complete FVV system is proposed to interactively control the viewpoints of video relay programs through multimedia terminals such as computers and tablets.
The hardware of the FVV generation system is a set of synchronously controlled cameras, and the software generates videos in novel viewpoints from the captured video using view interpolation. The interactive interface is designed to visualize the generated video in novel viewpoints and enable the viewpoint to be changed interactively.
Experiments show that our system can synthesize plausible videos in intermediate viewpoints with a view range of up to 180Â°.
