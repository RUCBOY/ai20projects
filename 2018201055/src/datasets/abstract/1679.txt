Applying Model Driven Architecture (MDA) concepts and tools to Multi Agent Systems (MAS) is a topic of great interest in recent years. MDA intends to reduce computer code development effort via model transformations and makes complex systems available and more practical for research. In this work, we propose a model transformation process for a widely used agent-based modeling and simulation tool, RePast Simphony. We adopt SysML for the platform-independent specification of an agent. We provide platform-independent and platform-specific models for an agent model, a mapping between them and a meta-model specification for RePast Flowchart Diagrams. We show the process for a SysML to RePast round-trip model transformation. Our work covers transformations to/from SysML Activity Diagram from/to RePast Flowchart Diagram.
