With great value in real applications, sequential recommendation aims to recommend users the personalized sequential actions. To achieve better performance, it is essential to consider both long-term preferences and sequential patterns (i.e., short-term dynamics). Compared to widely used Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Self-Attention Network (SAN) obtains a surge of interest due to fewer parameters, highly parallelizable computation, and flexibility in modeling dependencies. However, existing SAN-based models are inadequate in characterizing and distinguishing users’ long-term preferences and short-term demands since they do not emphasize the importance of the current interest and temporal order information of sequences. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-layer long- and short-term self-attention network (LSSA) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we first split the entire sequence of a user into multiple sub-sequences according to the timespan. Then the first self-attention layer learns the user’s short-term dynamics based on the last sub-sequence, while the second one captures the user’s long-term preferences through the previous sub-sequences and the last one. Finally, we integrate the long- and short-term representations together to form the user’s final hybrid representation. We evaluate the proposed model on three real-world datasets, and our experimental results show that LSSA outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a wide margin.
