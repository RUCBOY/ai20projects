With the growth of connectivity to smart grids, new applications, and the changing interaction between customer and energy clouds, clouds are more vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. Efficient detection methods are required to authenticate, detect and control attackers. Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, CAPTCHA, is one efficient tool to thwart denial of service attacks. The server presents the user with a client puzzle to solve in order to gain access to the service or website. The puzzle should be hard enough for computers, but easy for humans to solve. Several methods have been suggested including the popular image-based, as well as video-based, and text-based CAPTCHAs. In this paper, we present a new Flash-based gaming CAPTCHA to differentiate bots from humans. We propose a drag and drop client puzzle where the user will play a simple game to answer a visual question. Our method turns out to be convenient, easy for users and challenging for bots. Additionally, it has gaming aspect, which makes it interesting to users of all age groups.
