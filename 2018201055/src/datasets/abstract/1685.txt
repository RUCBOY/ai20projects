Lithium disilicate (LD) is a popular dental ceramic and has been a focus of dental research. Nevertheless, a quantified literature analysis focusing on the research of lithium disilicate is lacking.
The purpose of this bibliometric analysis was to review the progress of research into lithium disilicate in dentistry, including the identification of contributing researchers, organizations, countries or regions, journals, and the analysis of high-impact keywords and research trending.
The search was carried out within the topic field of the Web of Science (WoS) database, collecting publications related to LD from between 1996 and 2019. Metadata including the titles, abstracts, keywords, authors, affiliations, countries or regions, and references were extracted. Bibliometric indicators in terms of documents, authors, journals, and keywords were analyzed.
Between 1996 and 2019, the dental research on LD trended upward. Scholars in the United States, Germany, Switzerland, and Brazil actively participated in the research on LD, and publications from the United States had the most citations. The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry and Dental Materials were the major contributing journals. High-impact terms could be categorized into types of restorative material, types of prostheses, and properties or techniques of materials. Co-occurrence and relative normalized citation analysis of keywords highlighted several research interests, such as comparison studies between LD and zirconia, computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) techniques, and the performance of complete coverage LD restorations.
With the global upsurge in research on lithium disilicate, extensive collaborations and citations have been noted among authors, institutions, and countries or regions. Research hotspots include types of restorative material, types of prostheses, and properties or techniques of materials.
