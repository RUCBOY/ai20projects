The data volume is growing rapidly in material science. Every year data volume is getting double in many context of material science. The growing rate of data in material science is demanding for new computational infrastructures that can speed-up material discovery and deployment. In this survey, we are focusing on the challenges in material science due to growing data rate, and how Big Data technology can play a major role in research of material science. This survey includes various disciplines that can be used with Big Data to provide better analysis in the material science research.
