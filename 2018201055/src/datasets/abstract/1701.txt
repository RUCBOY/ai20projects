There are many different meanings related to the problem of mess (disorder). Although most of them relate to philosophical or social areas, this article presents an engineering view of the concept of mess. The multi-agent modeling was used to describe the real situation in an office (or more generally - workplace). In a real situation, collaborators use shared resources (items in the room, such as office supplies). If colleagues constantly change the location of individual items, they create a mess in which not everyone can find themselves. To present such situation, a computer simulation was used. There are several independent agents with decision-making ability. They carry out their move dependent on used tactic. Tactics are considered according to, widely known, a game theory. The degree of disorder of the system is inspected by the value of entropy. Moreover, the number of attempts to access objects and the time needed to locate them are considered. Many numerical experiments were performed to check the stability of the prepared model. The engineering aspect of mess analysis, through computer simulation, allows you to observe the phenomenon and draw conclusions for the future.
