The management of hydrographical systems is still mainly based on the expertise of the managers. Although this expertise enables the efficient management of these networks under normal conditions, modifications due to human activities or climate change could lead them to manage situations that were not known until now. In addition, advances in Automation, Computing Science and Artificial Intelligence provide tools and methods to assist the managers. In particular, the use of tele-remote systems, as SCADA, allows the collection of data and the control of hydraulic devices. Today, by benefiting from the power of computers and servers, the digital twins of hydrographical networks can be designed. A digital twin aims to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of a canal. It is used to play-back past scenarios allowing feedback of applied management strategies and fast simulations with predictive and adaptive management strategies to determine their performances and giving decision aid criteria for the managers. The objective of the presented paper is to define the framework for a digital twin of the Canal of Calais.
