Here, in this work, growth of smart structure has been considered by the author for the purpose of packet routing. These packets should be routed in smart manner in presence of IOT. The way using which communication in routers take place, is described by routing protocol. In order to determine path in the middle of two nodes which are present over computer network it distribute information. Definite paths are selected through routing methods. Router already known which type of networks is connected with it. On the other hand, lot of researches is already done in order to know impact of black hole attack over network which are formed on the basis of AODV. Here, impact of implemented fuzzy logic in routing protocol is tackled. In this work, influence caused by the Black Hole attack on AODV was displayed. These influences are caused in situations where the concept related to fuzzy logic is already used. Here, comparative analysis in the middle of anticipated design and earlier model in terms of black hole effect on network efficiency is discussed. In situations, where Fuzzy logic is used, efficiency of network which is derived on the basis of AODV becomes better in comparison to previous models. It happens because in this logic nodes are selected in an arbitrary way. The ways in which spiteful nodes make impact on the transmission ratio of packet are displayed through output. In addition to this, effect on packet loss ratio, normal cover to cover transmission is also displayed. At the same time, comparison in the middle of anticipated design and previous design in terms of packet transmission ratio has been performed.
