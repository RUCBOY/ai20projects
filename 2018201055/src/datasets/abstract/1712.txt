Science parks as knowledge-intensive area developments aim to enhance networking, and innovative and economic performances of firms and regions. This paper seeks to explore the perceived benefits (i.e. types of performance indicators) that science park firms associate with specific science park attributes. Association data between twenty science park attributes with twelve benefits is collected through an online interview involving 51 firms on science parks in the Netherlands. Results show that both proximity and managerial attributes are associated with economic, innovation and networking benefits. Real estate attributes, on the other hand, are mainly linked to economic benefits. The role of science park management and their activities is acknowledged by tenants as important. They perceive it as beneficial for developing ties with other firms, while they are perceived to fulfil only an indirect role in enhancing innovation. The reasoning of science park firms provides academics, practitioners and policy-makers with valuable insight in what benefits firms might seek and which attributes are considered essential to acquire these perceived benefits.
