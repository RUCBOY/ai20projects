This article traces efforts over the past decade by the National Institute of Mental Health, of the US National Institutes of Health, and other US organizations to build capacity for mental health researchers to advance activities in implementation science. Authors briefly chronicle the antecedents to the field's growth, and describe funding opportunities, workshop and conferences, training programs, and other initiatives that have collectively engaged hundreds of mental health researchers in the development and execution of implementation studies across the breadth of contexts where mental health care and prevention programs are delivered to those in need. The authors summarize a number of key initiatives and present potential next steps to further build the capacity for a new generation of implementation studies in mental health.
