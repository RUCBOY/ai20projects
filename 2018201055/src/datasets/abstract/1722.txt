Designing and conducting effective intervention research is an important domain of nursing science. Nurse scientists have long recognized people with chronic conditions need effective self-management strategies across the lifespan, so they have led the way in establishing theoretical and practical grounds for the science of self-management. Guidance from pilot and feasibility research for self-management interventions is scarce. Documented exemplars of successes and failures in pilot and feasibility study designs are scant in the literature.
The purpose of this paper is to illustrate methodological approaches using pilot and feasibility examples. To maximize collective lessons learned in self-management science study design, features of our pilot and feasibility research strategies that yielded both desirable and undesirable outcomes are described, analyzed, and paired with alternative solutions.
A National Institute of Nursing Research P30 grant center, awarded grants to 8 pilot investigators to pilot self-management interventions. A wide variety of chronic conditions were addressed, including heart failure, chronic kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, and HIV. The investigators provided their experiences of study implementation. Common themes across the studies were identified.
There were four lessons learned from these studies: 1) maximize resources and develop enough evidence for subsequent studies; 2) embed patient-centered feasibility within implementation testing with new patient populations; 3) develop a flexible participant recruitment plan to allow for adjustments when unexpected barriers arise; and 4) define study-specific data collection procedures to demonstrate feasibility.
Researchers conducting preliminary small-scale self-management intervention research must balance resources to develop and implement interventions to meet pilot and feasibility objectives.
