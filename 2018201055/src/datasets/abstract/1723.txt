This study was to explore factors predicting the use of e-learning during Corona Virus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) among sport science education students In Indonesia Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The study was conducted through survey with 974 participating students from five Indonesian HEIs. An extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with facilitating condition as the external factor was implemented to be the theoretical framework of this study. An analysis method through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to measure and assess the proposed model. The findings informed that: (1) the TAM-based proposed scale has been successfully explained factors predicting the use of e-learning among Indonesian sport science students during the pandemic; (2) the finding of significant relationships between facilitating condition and perceived ease of use and between facilitating condition and perceived usefulness was reported; and (3) the significant relationships among core components of TAM were found except for one, relationship between perceived usefulness and attitude.
