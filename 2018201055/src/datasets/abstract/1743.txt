Energy creates 35% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1]. Information technology (IT) is a significant end user of energy, consuming over 10% of commercial electricity [2]. 0.37GtCO2e of IT GHG emissions are attributed to end user computing (EUC) devices, such as desktop computers and notebooks [3]. The United Nations (UN) indicates combining existing technology innovative and behavioural changes has the potential to transform societies and reduce GHG emissions [4]. As the commercial and public sector transitions from desktops to notebooks [5], accurately identifying energy efficient mobile devices offers the ability to support this concept by reducing concomitant GHG emissions. However, accurately measuring device use phase energy (UPE) generated GHG emissions is elusive. Organisations currently avoid the direct measurement due to scale, complexity and logistical issues that cause the practice to become costly and therefore impractical [6]. As an alternative, EUC energy consumption is estimated based on typical electricity consumption (TEC) benchmark data, extrapolated by the number of users and then converted to GHG equivalent units. Conducting a field experiment measuring EUC energy consumption in a business environment, this research substantiates that accepted estimation methods introduce an error range between -48% to +107%. Consequently, the error causes EUC GHG scope 2 accounting to be underestimated by 30% and abatement opportunities of up to 55% to be overlooked.
