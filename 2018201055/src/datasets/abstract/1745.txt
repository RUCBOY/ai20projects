This paper presents a new approach for a four-level EAP course to meet the recently emerged needs to internationalize and improve undergraduate science and engineering programs at a typical research university in China's mainland. The biggest challenges for the course were students' inadequate entry-level English proficiency, English teachers' insufficient subject knowledge, a complete lack of appropriate textbooks, along with stakeholders' conflicting appeals but their common belief in the vital role of academic English to students' career and the university's prestige. To address these challenges, a new solution was formulated characteristic of a compromise between the narrow-angle and wide-angle EAP perspectives and an integration of skills development, content acquisition, and genre awareness, with the aim to prepare students for the cognitive and linguistic demand in scientific communication and to bridge the gap between their entry level English proficiency and research writing and presentation abilities. Accordingly, four typical genres in scientific communication were selected as the main types of teaching materials – science popularizations, semi-popularizations, technical reports, and research articles – representing a continuum with increasing technicality levels. Students' positive feedback suggests the novel approach might be an important contribution to the ongoing quest by EAP practitioners worldwide for context-specific pedagogical practices.
