Augmented reality (AR) provides additional information to the reality of sportspeople, and might offer supplementary advantages compared to other technologies. The goals of this study were to characterize and understand the benefits of AR in sports education and training. We reviewed Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science, and SportDiscus databases, and discussed the results according to their role in sport (practitioner, spectator, and customer). Our results showed that different AR approaches might be used for learning and providing feedback. New rules could be introduced for reducing the gap between players with different experience levels. Additional information could also be added to improve the audience experience. We also explored the limitations of current AR systems and their efficacy in training, and provided suggestions for designing training scenarios.
