In this paper we introduce a novel strategy for generalizing existing puzzles and games by mathematically expressing the operations of the game; then deriving mathematical generalizations of those expressions; and finally implementing a new variant of the game using those generalized operations. The strategy is illustrated in a case study involving the adapting of a traditional game/puzzle to exploit the computational power of smart devices. The focus here is not so much on the end product as it is on the process and considerations underpinning its development by use of the proposed approach. Ancillary results of the venture include generalizations of the circular-shift operator and examination of its computational complexity.
