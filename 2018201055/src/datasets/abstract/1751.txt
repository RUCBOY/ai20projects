Prolonged sitting while working at a computer leads to poor sitting postures, which can aggravate low back pain in many individuals. We examined the intertester reliability of using the modified musculoskeletal impairment schema for classifying participants sitting at computers for prolonged times.
Fifty participants were examined independently by each therapist using a test-retest design. Each therapist assigned an musculoskeletal impairment classification upon completion of the examination. The agreement percentages and the kappa coefficient were used to evaluate intertester reliability in classifying participants with prolonged sitting.
The percentage agreement between the 2 examiners for participants who maintained the sitting posture for prolonged times was 84%. The calculated kappa coefficient was 0.73, reflecting a substantial level of agreement.
The present findings provide some evidence to support the classification of individuals who sit at computers for prolonged times and participants with rotation with flexion pattern would need to manage asymmetry pattern in a subclinical group.
