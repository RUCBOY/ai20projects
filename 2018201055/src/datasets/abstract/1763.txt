Multilayered materials can be characterized by the extraordinary combination of the strength and ductility. Because of that in the last decades many works were focused on the development of plastic deformation processes of such materials. However, metal forming processes of multilayered materials face many new problems because of its inhomonegeity and different mechanical behavior of each layer. The most comprehensive example is deep drawing process which includes in its characteristic different material behavior during deformation process.
In the present study it was expected that the way of manufacturing and the morphology of multilayered structure directly affect the deformation mechanisms. The investigated materials were bonded by the explosive welding process. This method allows joining completely different materials from the point of view of physical and mechanical properties. The three-layered material was built in the Cu-Steel-Cu sequence To characterize mechanical behavior, the multilayered materials were applied to the plastic deformation i.e. tensile tests of as-received and annealed material were conducted and analyzed. The obtained results were used to design the deep drawing tests. The experimental investigations were supported by the numerical simulations using the commercial QForm Software.
