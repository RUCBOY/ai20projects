In recent decades, the development of social computing systems has realized the efficient information exchange between large groups of people. Nowadays, social computing systems are rather complex platforms supported by not only traditional sociology theory but also computer science and big data based applications. With the increase of the social computing systemsâ€™ complexities, serious issues of social digital security and privacy have shown up since, in recent years, more and more social data leakage incidents are happening. This fact is due to reasons on many different aspects since there are many sources threatening the security and privacy of the social data in such a complex social computing system. In this paper, we improve the traditional social data protection schemes by combining the information fragmentation concepts with the distributed system architectures to build a novel social data protection scheme. We use social photo protection as the fundamental scenario and deploy our novel scheme to illustrate the improvement on the protection level with the protection analysis in detail. A security analysis of practically realizing such a scheme is also evaluated in this paper.
