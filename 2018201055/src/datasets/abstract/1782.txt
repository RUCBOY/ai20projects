A sample of 2649 refereed publications in a sub-field of meteor science in 2000–2018 was analysed. The analysed sample included publications relating to meteors and meteoroids, but not to meteorites or interplanetary dust. The number of publications was stable at approximately 160 annually. The mean number of authors per publication increased from about 3.0 (2000–2009) to 4.7–4.9 (2010–2018). The contribution of the single-author publications was higher than in astronomy as the whole, averaging 31% in the first 10 years and 19% in the last 9 years. The number of researchers doubled from 2000 to 2018, reaching 588 in 2018. The mean normalised number of publications per one researcher per year was 0.43, decreasing slightly in the last 8–10 years, but generally being stable.
