Cloud-based CNC (C-CNC) is an emerging concept within Industry 4.0 where computer numerical control (CNC) functionalities are moved to the cloud and provided to manufacturing machines as a service. Among many benefits, C-CNC allows manufacturing machines to leverage advanced control algorithms running on cloud computers to boost their performance at low cost, without need for major hardware upgrades. However, a fundamental challenge of C-CNC is how to guarantee safety and reliability of machine control given variable Internet quality of service (e.g. delays), especially on public Internet networks. We propose a three-tier redundant architecture to address this challenge. We then prototype tier one of the architecture on a 3D printer successfully controlled via C-CNC over public Internet connections, and discuss follow-on research opportunities.
