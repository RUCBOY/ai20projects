Simulation is one teaching strategy that health educators use to promote active learning, however, evidence to support whether students utilising simulations develop skills in critical thinking and appraisal in their academic literacy, is lacking. This study explored the impact of embedding a desktop simulation about the hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in a first-year, undergraduate nursing course on students' acquisition of knowledge, self-confidence, and development of critical thinking in academic writing. The study used a quasi-experimental, two-group, and pre-test-post-test design. After using the simulation, students reported i. a positive learning experience, ii. an increase in their self-confidence to critically appraise a case study, and iii. greater student success in two assessments for student's participating in the simulation compared to students who only used lecture notes as a study tool. The findings support the use of simulations to promote active learning, knowledge acquisition and opportunities to develop self-confidence and critical thinking in academic writing.
