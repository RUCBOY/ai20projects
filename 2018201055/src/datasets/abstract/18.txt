Compare musculoskeletal discomfort, productivity, postural risks, and perceived fatigue for a sit-stand-walk intervention between two workstation configurations â€“ one, individually customized for office workers according to ergonomic guidelines (Ergo-Fit); another, self-adjusted by office workers according to their preference (Self-Adjusted).
36 participants performed a 60-min computer typing task in both configurations using a within-participants, counterbalanced design. Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue were reported through surveys; productivity was operationalized by typing speed and typing error; postural risks were assessed by RULA for seated work, and REBA for standing work.
Musculoskeletal discomfort and perceived fatigue did not vary significantly between configurations. Postural risks for seated and standing work were significantly lower for Ergo-Fit configuration; productivity was significantly higher for Self-Adjusted configuration.
Use of Ergo-Fit configuration for a sit-stand-walk intervention can facilitate postural transitions and increase physical activity, while enabling neutral postures in seated and standing work to minimize postural risks.
