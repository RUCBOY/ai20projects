Blind image deconvolution is a fundamental task in image processing, computational imaging, and computer vision. It has earned intensive attention in the past decade since the seminal work of Fergus et al. [1] for camera shake removal. In spite of the recent great progress in this field, this paper aims to formulate the blind problem with a simpler modeling perspective. What is more important, the newly proposed approach is expected to achieve comparable or even better performance towards the real blurred images. Specifically, the core critical idea is the proposal of a pure gradient-based discriminative prior for accurate and robust blur kernel estimation. Numerous experimental results on both the benchmark datasets and real-world blurred images in various imaging scenarios, e.g., natural, manmade, low-illumination, text, or people, demonstrate well the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.
