Multi-channel control is a way of control using a few different channels simultaneously. The example of the multi-channel system is the extended brain-computer interface (extended-BCI) where voice, gesture and BCI control channels are used at the same time. However, this way of control is redundant: one command can be executed using different control channels. Because of each channel have errors of both types the control using few channels simultaneously can increase unwanted influence on robotic device control. One way to decrease this effect is to decompose the multi-channel control method into one composite channel. That composed channel should be defined based on some parameter and the best way of control. In this article, we consider MTnP parameter. During decomposition of the multi-channel system, command information not in composed channel is usually ignored. In this article, we propose a way of this information interpretation to improve the multi-channel control decomposition method for a robotic wheelchair using the extended-BCI.
