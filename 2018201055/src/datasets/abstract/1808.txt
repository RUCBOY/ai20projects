Due to the recent prevalence of IoT (Internet of Things) technologies, various IoT devices connect to the Internet and continuously send their generated data to remote processing computers such as video data or sensor data. The transaction rate is one of the main factors to improve the performance of some IoT applications. For instance, in surveillance systems, the probability to catch a thief increases as the processing computer analyzes the video with a higher transaction rate. To improve the transaction rate, some methods reduce the transaction time between a processing computer and stream data sources under a static transaction interval. However, the transaction rate can be further improved by changing the transaction interval dynamically depending on the transaction time. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the transaction rate by changing the transaction interval dynamically. In our proposed method, a processing computer sometimes changes the transaction interval to be the same length as the average transaction time. Moreover, our proposed method adopts a progressive quality improvement (PQI) approach to reduce the transaction time. We measured the transaction rate of our proposed method by both a simulator and an implemented system. We confirmed that our proposed method can improve the transaction rate by 4.4 times and the transaction time by 21% at least compared with the conventional method. Moreover, we confirmed that the average frame rate increases 22% compared with a simple method in a real situation.
