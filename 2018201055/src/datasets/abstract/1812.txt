Society 5.0 is the vision of a new human-centered society in the fifth stage launched by Japan. This paper explores a prospective model of science, technology and innovation (STI) activities in Society 5.0 from an ecosystem perspective. STI policy review and statistical analysis are conducted in comparison with Germany and the United States to describe the historical transformation of Japan's STI ecosystem. Major socio-economic risks on Japan's STI ecosystem can be classified as labor, capital and spatial risks. Shifting from a push-based STI ecosystem to a pull-based STI ecosystem and increasing the system resilience through value creation for society are essential to reduce three risks and to revitalize productivity and growth in Society 5.0.
