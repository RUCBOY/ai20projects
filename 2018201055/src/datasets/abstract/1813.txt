Based on the transformations of SJ-MSD (modified-signed digit) addition and the principle of SJ-MSD adder, the application of SJ-MSD adder of TOC to mean value filtering (ternary optical computer) is introduced. The realization of mean filtering processing is presented by reconfiguring SJ-MSD adders on TOP (ternary optical processor) in detail. Experiments show that the mean filter processing in TOC can be carried out successfully with a multiple of SJ-MSD parallel adders with large number of data bits. It also shows a great promise and advantages for the application of TOC in digital image processing and other respects.
