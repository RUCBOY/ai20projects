This study uses the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to predicts the level of technology acceptance by vocational agriculture teachers at the secondary levels in Iran.
In the literature review of appropriate models, the Technology Acceptance Model proved the most efficacious. A modified version of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) proposed by Davis, Warshaw, and Bagozzi (1989) was modified and expanded to include the variables of facilitating conditions, available resources, job relevance, computer self-efficacy, subjective norm, age, and computer anxiety and was implemented using structural equation modeling using data collected from 154 secondary-level vocational agriculture.
This study shows that the modified TAM model, explained 15% of the variance in information technology usage among vocational agriculture teachers. Furthermore, at the 5% level, relationships showed that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, behavioral intention, subjective norms, computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety were all significant while age, and available resources showed significance at the 10% level.
The paper will assist policy-makers in recognizing what factors they can control to promote the adoption IT as well as identifying characteristics of educators that could inhibit such adoption.
The paper reveals the modified TAM model provides an adequate description of factors available to policy-makers for promoting the incorporation of IT as well as insights into how faculty members’ disposition toward the adoption of technology. The research provides useful insights into individual’s receptiveness toward the use of IT in classroom instruction, as well as extending the international scope of the modified TAM model with the inclusion of an Iranian study.
The paper provides recommendations on factors that could be used to increase the adoption of IT while other external variables describe the receptiveness of faculty members to the adoption of IT.
