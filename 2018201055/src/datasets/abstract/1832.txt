With the rapid development of the national economy and the widespread use of computer applications platforms, we are analyzing the explosive growth of data, and, data binding and loading delays become a significant problem for this application. Asymmetry of semantic information between a source of the application and the image memory problems. In recent years, intelligent computing, has become a major research analysis of the semantic content. It is also in the order that is generating the offline and online learning characteristics, machine learning, and has become a hot research. The meaning of the image such semantic relatedness, classification, annotation, and in larger environments, tasks such as meaning analysis of such content hash mapping application image, learning. Caption of the image is an important issue in the semantic content of the image analysis. Comments can establish a relationship between the image classification and semantic content. Intelligent learning computer analyze and solve problems, to extract large amounts of data based on the views of a large image. The image semantic content analysis and visual vocabulary and metadata are combined, in planning. Hash value is a semantic metadata, additional metadata to obtain in-depth research, as well as the structure and semantic metadata management at different levels.
