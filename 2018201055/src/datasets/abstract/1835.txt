Drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) Model, this study aimed to determine the key variables that facilitate the acceptance of mobile learning in two Middle Eastern countries (Saudi Arabia and Iraq), as well as identifying the constructs that can help enhance learners' motivation. A conceptual framework was proposed based on a modified UTAUT2, wherein trust was integrated, and new relationships were assumed among the proposed Model variables. Data were gathered using an online questionnaire from 469 higher education students of Computer Science. The collected data were analyzed with partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis (MGA) techniques. The results suggest significant differences in learners' perceptions from both countries. It was found that although some variables were significant in one country, they were not in the other and vice versa. Overall, the proposed framework explained 56.1% and 40.7%, respectively of the variance of behavioral intention and hedonic motivation among the Saudi sample (N = 246), and 51.1% and 41.9%, respectively of the variance of behavioral intention and hedonic motivation in the Iraqi sample (N = 223). These research outcomes are significant for educational institutions as they could help policy-makers better understand the issues facing mobile learning acceptance in terms of cultural similarities and differences. Accordingly, new strategies could be formulated to ensure improved mobile learning uptake.
