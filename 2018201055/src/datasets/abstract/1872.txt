Road boundary lanes are one of the serious causes of road accidents and it affects the driver and peopleâ€™s safety. Detecting road boundary lanes is a challenging task for both computer vision and machine learning approaches. In recent years many machine learning algorithms have been deploying but they failed to produce high efficiency and accuracy. This paper presents a novel approach to alert the driver when the car leaps beyond the Road boundary lanes by employing machine learning techniques to avoid road mishaps and ensuring driving safety. Performance is assessed through the generation of experimental results on the dataset. When compared with state-of-the-art lane detection techniques, the proposed technique produced high precision and high efficiency.
