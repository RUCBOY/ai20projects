The preeminent merit of function expansion bilinear (FEB) filters is their ability to represent nonlinear distributions for active noise control (ANC) systems. Unfortunately, the huge computational burden and bounded input bounded output (BIBO) unstable problem hinder its practical applications. In this paper, we propose a general channel reduced efficient implementation algorithm for FEB filter and two BIBO stable control methods, to further reduce the computational load and overcome the unstable problem. The efficiency of the proposed methods is verified by computational complexity analyses and computer simulations for nonlinear ANC (NANC) systems. The results of computational analysis and computer simulation show the satisfied control performances with significant computational reduction.
