Analyze the critical technology of the virtual city of 3D data modeling and GIS-based environment. Three-dimensional geographic information system, the recommendations of the three-dimensional geographic information system of the virtual urban environment, built-in three-dimensional geographic information systems, and 3D modeling data part demo support, the actual project. Conventional methods of computer-assisted equipment management system have been used in many fields, such as repair of such power facilities. However, most of these systems, they are the data management structure that has been dealing with only two-dimensional space, it has. Users to search for an interactive three-dimensional space can see the spatial view of the 3D environment. The three-dimensional graphics system would be beneficial for facility management. The describe the three-dimensional virtual city environment geographic information system that has been generated by the computer. Even if the virtual city is extensive, a prototype system and provide for interaction with a user, the system, and three-dimensional space information, not only the information of the geographic information system, can be processed. In this system, the user can get a perfect virtual environment for the geographic information system. Can derive the views needed to suit a particular purpose, called the geographic data, and stores the data from there. Spatial data and non-spatial data (attribute data); there are two types of geographic information data. Non-spatial data contains information about the function.
