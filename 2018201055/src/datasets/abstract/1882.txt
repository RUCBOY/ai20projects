Peer Learning is considered one of the innovative teaching learning strategies in current engineering education. It covers many learning techniques suitable for both in and out of the classroom. Some of the types includes peer tutoring, groups discussions (small or large groups), and feedback-based learning. These methods have been proven effective to improve students understanding provided peer learning techniques are well monitored and assisted. In this attempt of implementing peer learning, instructor assisted peer learning is adopted to see the effectiveness of the learning technique. The method is applied to 4th Sem B. Tech. in Computer Engineering in Computer Networks subject. Students are divided into group 0f 5-6 with a mix of fast learner, slow learner and regular (in attending lectures). A problem based on the previously discussed topic was given and asked to solve in a group within the class room. However, initially one member from each group has to come and describe the underlaying theory behind the problem and necessary care to be taken to solve it. After the activity, feedback on the activity is taken to know the reaction of the student. One quiz is also conducted to see the understanding of the topic. Similar quiz is also conducted in another class where the peer learning was not adopted and results are compared. Observation shows that understanding of the topic is better in the class where peer learning was adopted. An analysis of the studentsâ€™ feedback and results are presented in the paper.
