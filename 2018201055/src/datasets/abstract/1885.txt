The cost of Computer Numerical Control Machines is very high which leads to their widely inaccessible nature by small to mid-range manufacturing companies. Though, the technology is aimed at increasing efficiency and accuracy by achieving optimization in the traditional manufacturing methods, its most major drawback is the high cost of maintenance and installation. The article discusses an affordable solution to this issue. As a viable alternative, a SCARA Robotic arm is used to execute the process. The initial computer aided design is analysed for feasibility in real conditions using rigorous finite element methods and experimental validation. The workspace of the SCARA is modelled on general usage approximations; a detailed kinematic and dynamic robotic analysis is also done to ensure better process conditions and the future possibility to achieve force feedback control. This prototype can be operated using user-based systems and can be designed following the methodology proposed in this article. A combination of metals and non-metals are used depending upon various factors such as strength requirements, design complexity and cost. Both traditional and additive manufacturing techniques are employed to manufacture the parts, An Arduino microcontroller is used to execute all control structures and operations. The control for a batch operation can be entered through the touchscreen attached in the robot, with a special mode for individual production. The technology proposed in this paper is aimed at assisting Micro to small manufacturing enterprises (MSMEs) to achieve higher productivity.
