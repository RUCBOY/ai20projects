Graph embedding is an important technique used in studying the problem of efficiently implementing parallel algorithms on parallel computers. Wirelength is an embedding parameter widely studied in data structures and data representations, electrical networks, VLSI network and chemical graphs. This parameter had been studied for embedding complete bipartite graphs into complete necklace, star necklace and windmill graphs.
