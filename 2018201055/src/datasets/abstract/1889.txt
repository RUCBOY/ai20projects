Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a modern and progressive technology for controlling robotic devices. They are broadly applicable in various fields of robotics and information technologies, where alternative methods of controlling electronic devices are used (for example, medical robotics, development of virtual reality applications, game industry, etc.). The most common ways to implement BCI control commands are mental images, evoked potentials, and facial expressions. Compared to other methods, mental images are difficult to perform because of the need to perform an intensified mental activity and concentrate strongly on their execution. At the same time, mental images provide the operator with a promising opportunity to control the robot without performing any physical movements (compared to facial expressions usage) and without using additional equipment for stimuli representation (as is the case of evoked potentials). Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research on various aspects of working with mental images, such as the use of various types of mental images, the impact on the work of distractions, the operator’s preliminary training technique, etc., to improve the user experience of using them and the quality of device control via such way of control. In this paper, we consider use mental images of different types as BCI control commands — visual, sound, kinesthetic. Performing of these commands is involving various parts of the brain. The quality of the operator’s work with these types of mental images is evaluated, including the quality of mental images recognition by the BCI, as well as the time spent by the operator on their execution.
