Anti-terrorism research is an important academic topic in current societies. The crucial features of attacked incidents can be obtained effectively by identifying phase division of terrorism history. To handle time-series issues, complex networks theories are efficient and reliable analysis solutions. Therefore, we propose an original community detection method for complex time-series networks. Especially, we consider the improved local density operator and bi-directional neighbor retrieval (ILD-BNR). First, complex networks of threatened countries are established by incidents feature and time-series principles. Then, cores of networks are selected by improved density operator. After that, attributes of unstable nodes are revised iteratively until initialization is finished. The optimal classification results are obtained by retrieval pattern of bi-directional neighbor. Finally, on the basis of clustering consequences, historical phases are divided ultimately. The mechanism of each phase is discussed simultaneously. The experiments demonstrate some important conclusions: a) The accuracy of proposed method is better than other evaluated algorithms on real time-series networks; b) The historical phase number is reduced reasonably, which is beneficial to analysis of information; and c) Classification consequences can reflect the historical tendency of terrorism.
