Industrial edge devices starting to play a major role as API gateway for data consumers or cloud applications. To fulfill this task industrial edge devices are mostly build from single board computer or small computers with an operation system. Considering the increasing processing power of these computers there is room for applications that enable data preparation for data consumers on the shop floor. This paper proposes a lightweight approach to structure data with the SAX Algorithm and add semantic informationâ€™s to the dataset. Additionally, an example using machine data gathered from a manufacturing system with MQTT is provided.
