The study of methods and models for the analysis of images of bone marrow preparations in computer microscopy systems for the diagnosis of minimal residual disease is carried out. A sample of preparations for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was formed for the study. Bone marrow cell images were obtained for this sample. As a result of experimental studies, the results of classification of bone marrow cells using different classifiers were obtained.
