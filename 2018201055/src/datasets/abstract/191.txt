Software-defined networking (SDN) has been increasingly utilized to enforce the security of complex networks. However SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms rely heavily on some specific security policies containing underlying network information. Facing the increasingly complex and huge SDN networks, we urgently need a novel security policy management mechanism which can be completely transparent to any underlying network information. That is it can permit network managers to define the high-level security policy model without containing any underlying information, and by means of model transformation, high-level security policy model can be automatically transformed into its corresponding lower-level security policy model containing underlying information. Moreover, we must ensure the system model of data plane updated by the low-level security policy model can hold all of security properties defined in high-level security policy model. Based on these insights, we propose a security policy model transformation and verification approach for SDN in this paper. We first specify the security policies used in SDN networks as a formal security policy model (SPM). Then we establish the system model of SDNâ€™s data plane and the mapping rules between the policy objects of SPM and the system objects of system model of data plane. Based on these mapping rules, we propose a security policy model transformation mechanism which transforms SPM into the low-level security policy model, RSPM. In order to verify the system model of data plane updated by RSPM can hold all of security properties defined in SPM, we propose a security policy verification mechanism based on model checking techniques and a group of validation conditions. Finally, we utilize a comprehensive case to illustrate the feasibility of this approach.
