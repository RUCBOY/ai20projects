The use of written or computer-based examinations to assess readiness to for entry into professional nursing practice assumes a relationship between cognitive assessment and clinical nursing judgment, but there is no evidence to support this.
This quantitative, correlational study used historical data from a school of nursing database to conduct a retrospective analysis to examine the relationships between NCLEX-RN® predictor exams, clinical reasoning, clinical nursing judgment, and simulation performance at the end of a baccalaureate nursing program.
The results did not show a positive relationship between critical thinking and clinical reasoning, clinical nursing judgment or simulation performance.
Consistent with other studies, the lack of a relationship demonstrates that readiness to take and pass the NCLEX-RN® is not adequate for evaluation of readiness for entry into professional nursing practice.
