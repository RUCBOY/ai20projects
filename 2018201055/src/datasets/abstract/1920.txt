Riemannian sparse coding methods are attracting increasing interest in many computer vision applications, relying on its non-Euclidean structure. One such recently successful task is image set classification by the aid of Grassmann Manifolds, where an image set can be seen as a point. However, due to irrelevant information and outliers, the probe set may be represented by misleading sets with large sparse coefficients. Meanwhile, it is difficult for a single subspace to cover changes within an image set and the hidden structure among samples is relaxed. In this paper, we propose a novel Grassmann Locality-Aware Group Sparse Coding model (GLGSC) that attempts to preserve locality information and take advantage of the relationship among image sets to capture the inter and intra-set variations simultaneously. Since the contributions of different gallery subspaces to the probe subspace should vary in importance, we then introduce a novel representation adaption term. In addition, a kernelised version of GLGSC is proposed to handle non-linearity in data. To reveal the effectiveness of our algorithm over state-of-the-art, several classification tasks are conducted, including face recognition, object recognition and gesture recognition.
