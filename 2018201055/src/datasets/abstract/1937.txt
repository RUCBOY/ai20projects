High-Performance Computing (HPC) research, from hardware and software to the end applications, provides remarkable computing power to help scientists solve complex problems in science, engineering, or even daily business. Over the last decades, Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries have been powering numerous scientific applications, such as weather forecasting, earthquake simulations, physic, and chemical simulations, to conduct ever-large-scale experiments. However, it is always challenging to practice HPC research. In this article, we use the well-established MVAPICH project to discuss how researchers can transform the HPC research into a high-performance MPI library and translate it to the HPC community.
