Paretic syndrome in the hand motor function is noted in 80% of stroke patients, and in half of them the paresis persists for life. The using of non-invasive BCI based on EEG - data for rehabilitation and quality of life improvement is a promising and rapidly developing direction. Today, such devices actively advance in the direction of developing control systems for patients’ imaginary motor activity. The purpose of this study is to assess the post-stroke patients’ special characteristics of the brain bioelectrical activity in real and image movements processes.
