Encryption plays an important role in protecting data, especially data transferred on the Internet. However, encryption is computationally expensive and this leads to high energy costs. Parallel encryption solutions using more CPU/GPU cores can achieve high performance. If we consider energy efficiency to be cost effective using parallel encryption solutions at the same time, this problem can be alleviated effectively. Because many CPU/GPU cores and encryption are pervasive currently, saving energy cost by parallel encrypting has become an unavoidable problem. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient parallel Advance Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for CPU-GPU heterogeneous platforms. These platforms, such as the Green 500 computers, are popular in both high performance and general computing. Parallelizing AES algorithm, using both GPUs and CPUs, balances the workload between CPUs and GPUs based on their computing capacities. This approach also uses the Nvidia Management Library (NVML) to adjust GPU frequencies, overlaps data transfers and computation, and fully utilizes GPU computing resources to reduce energy consumption as much as possible. Experiments conducted on a platform with one K20M GPU and two Xeon E5-2640 v2 CPUs show that this approach can reduce energy consumption by 74% compared to CPU-only parallel AES algorithm and 21% compared to GPU-only parallel AES algorithm on the same platform. Its energy efficiency is 4.66 MB/Joule on average higher than both CPU-only parallel AES algorithm (1.15 MB/Joule) and GPU-only parallel AES algorithm (3.65 MB/Joule). As an energy-efficient parallel AES algorithm solution, it can be used to encrypt data on heterogeneous platforms to save energy, especially for the computers with thousands of heterogeneous nodes.
