Maximin distance Latin hypercube designs (LHDs) are extensively applied in computer experiments, but it is challenging to construct such designs. In this paper, based on a 22 full factorial design and a series of saturated two-level regular designs, a number of maximin distance LHDs are constructed via the rotation method. Some of the constructed LHDs are exactly optimal and the others are asymptotically optimal under the maximin L2-distance criterion. The constructed maximin distance LHDs have two prominent advantages: (i) no computer search is needed; and (ii) they are orthogonal or nearly orthogonal. Detailed comparisons with existing LHDs show that the constructed LHDs have larger minimum distances between design points.
