Inspired by the recurrent highway networks, we study the coupled networks as a modular behavior of the networks, which can better improve the performance of the system. For a neural network, the non-zero continuous attractors play an important role to decode the information. The emphasis of this paper is to study the conditions for the generation of non-zero continuous attractors in the coupled new system theoretically. By exploring the relationship between network parameters, the conditions for generating non-zero continuous attractors in the new model are successfully determined. In order to verify the correctness and validity of the proposed conclusions, the results of this paper are further verified by simulation.
