A comparison of various scale invariant crowd count analysis methods is conducted. The methods are chosen such that they have the ability to accurately predict crowd count from an arbitrary perspective. An investigation is conducted where their comparison is based on MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and MSE (Mean Squared Error) which are the chosen evaluation metrics and their architecture is discussed. Models are to be assessed based on their performance and subsequent results on the ShanghaiTech Dataset and the UCF-CC-50 Dataset. This is enough to give a thorough comparison of these models. The approach compares a variety of models that utilize Dilated Convolutional Neural Networks, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks and Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Networks.
