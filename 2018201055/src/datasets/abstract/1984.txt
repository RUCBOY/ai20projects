The purpose of this paper is to serve as a template for greater understanding for the practicing radiologist about key steps to perform multimodality computer analysis of MRI images, specifically in multiple sclerosis patients. With this understanding, radiologists will be better equipped about how best to process and analyze MRI imaging data and obtain accurate quantitative information for MS patient evaluation. A secondary intent of this article is to improve radiologist understanding of how artificial intelligence will be employed in the future for better patient stratification, and for evaluation of response to therapy in both clinical care and drug trials.
