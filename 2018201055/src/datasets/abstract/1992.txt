Sociological theory of Peter M. Blau (Structural Contexts of Opportunities, Chicago 1994) consists of a series of verbal theorems on social structure and opportunities of contacts. Out of this series, we have selected five theorems which infer about dependence of interpersonal links on properties of actors, situated at nodes of a model network. The related assumptions made by Blau are reformulated and a new computational model is proposed of intergroup connections and social mobility. With this construction, simple analytical evaluations and computer simulations confirm the Blauâ€™s theory.
