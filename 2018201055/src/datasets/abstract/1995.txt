Scanning Technologies such as the Computer Topography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) gather three-dimensional data (3D) that can be viewed on 2D Screens. However, actual 3D models allow a better interaction with real objects. Developments in image partition algorithms and improved accessibility of three-dimensional (3D) printers has resulted in manufacturing cost effective patient-specific models without proficient knowledge. In this paper, a general workflow is executed to transform the medical image such as Computer Tomography (CT) to 3D printable physical model. The process is split into four stages: image acquisition, image partition, mesh adjustment and 3D printing. The efficacy of this streamlined workflow has been demonstrated by producing heart, kidneys, liver and lungs using Stratasys Object260 Connex 3D printer. This paper concludes with a general method to convert a medical image to 3D printable solid model and it works for the extensive array of organs and anatomical regions of interest. Also provided an outline of open-source softwareâ€™s which can be used for medical image partition by end users who are not specialized in image processing.
