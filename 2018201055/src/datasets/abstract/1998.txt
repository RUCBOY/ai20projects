This research aimed to develop a comprehensive evaluation of the mobile user interface abilities of the elderly so that technology can be designed to meet individualized needs. A total of 135 older adults were evaluated with the developed system, the Elderly Mobile User Interface Ability Evaluation System (EMUIAES). The prediction of age and the use of technology on elderly mobile interface usage were investigated based on the findings of the evaluation. The relationship between performance on Fitts' task and elderly mobile user interface ability (EMUIA) was also examined. The findings showed a strong effect of age on the elderly's use of mobile user interfaces. Previous experience with personal and tablet computers also contributed to the use of mobile user interfaces. In addition, this research demonstrated the application of Fitts' law to describe the elderly mobile user interface behaviors, particularly for tasks involving fast tapping and pointing. The EMUIAES can provide future researchers and designers a comprehensive tool to describe the elderly's diverse behaviors and changes in their ability to use mobile interfaces. Individualized interface designs for elderly users can be developed based on these findings to improve the elderly users' experiences of using technology.
