The initial problem of reconstructing a three-dimensional image from the data of a stereo pair of technical vision is to determine the internal parameters of each camera of a stereoscopic system. The paper develops the issues of calibration of a projective camera, defines the problem of calibration, and presents numerical methods of solution that are optimized for implementation on a computer, and, later, on FPGA. The ultimate objective of the study is to design a FPGA-based ASIC system that implements on-chip calibration functions for parameters of the stereo pair cameras, filtering, 3D image reconstruction, etc.
