Recent international efforts have focused on broadening opportunities for students to learn computer science (CS) in schools, prompting expansion of professional development (PD) programs for educators. But there is little research supporting the ongoing professional needs of computing teachers. This qualitative study examined how in-service CS teachers approached, learned, and anticipated teaching a hands-on electronic-textiles unit. Our findings illustrate that “problems of practice” from the classroom served as a compass to guide CS educators’ learning in PD. We also share implications for key features of PD programs that can transform the pedagogical knowledge and classroom practices of experienced teachers.
