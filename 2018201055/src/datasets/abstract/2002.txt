Communication between information processing systems becomes a challenge, especially in the “big data” era. It is a mandatory subject in the topic “Architecture and organization” of the computer science curriculum. However, in our experience, it is a rather complex topic for students. Simulation visualization can be used to graphically illustrate various concepts of computer science. In this paper, we present the application of NICSim-vhd, which is an acronym for VHDL-based Network Interface Card simulation model, as a pedagogical tool for supporting undergraduate computer science students’ education. NICSim-vhd allows simulating the network-to-memory data path at a network node and generating Value Change Dump (VCD) files for simulation visualization of hardware description languages-based models. We provide a taxonomy of learner engagement with simulation visualization. Grounded in Bloom’s well recognized taxonomy of understanding, we suggest how to assess the learning outcomes to which such engagement may lead.
