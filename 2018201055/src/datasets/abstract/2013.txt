Computers decrease human work and concentrate on enhancing the performance to advance the technology. Various methods have been developed to enhance the performance of computers. Performance of computer is based on computer architecture, while computer architecture differs in various devices, such as microcomputers, minicomputers, mainframes, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. While each device has its own architecture, the majority of these systems are built on Boolean algebra. In this study, a few basic concepts used in quantum computing are discussed. It is known that quantum computers do not possess any transistor and chip while being roughly 100 times faster than a common classic silicon computer. Scientists believe that quantum computers are the next generation of the classic computers.
