We introduce and develop a method that demonstrates that the algorithmic information content of a system can be used as a steering handle in the dynamical phase space, thus affording an avenue for controlling and reprogramming systems. The method consists of applying a series of controlled interventions to a networked system while estimating how the algorithmic information content is affected. We demonstrate the method by reconstructing the phase space and their generative rules of some discrete dynamical systems (cellular automata) serving as controlled case studies. Next, the model-based interventional or causal calculus is evaluated and validated using (1) a huge large set of small graphs, (2) a number of larger networks with different topologies, and finally (3) biological networks derived from a widely studied and validated genetic network (E.Â coli) as well as on a significant number of differentiating (Th17) and differentiated human cells from a curated biological network data.
