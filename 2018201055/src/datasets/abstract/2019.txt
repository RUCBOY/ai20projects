Game theory has found widespread use in various fields like Economics, Biology, Political Science, etc. and forms an aegis for logical decision making in these areas. In computer science, due to advancing technologies, there has been a pressing need to use game theory in various problems due to the lack of scalability of traditional solutions. There has been ongoing research in various fields of computer science like security, machine learning, cloud computing, etc. where game theoretic approaches are extensively used. In this paper, we present a review on game theoretical approaches to various fields in computer science such as privacy preservation, network security and intrusion detection and resource optimization. In the end, this paper provides a comparative study of various game models used in different applications in a tabular format.
