Ternary optical computer (TOC) is characterized by huge number of data bits, group by data bits and reconfigurable optical processor. With the improvement of TOC, building its programming platform has become an urgent task. So a basic theory and key technology of constructing a new programming platform are proposed: build a concise model that summarizes the application characteristics of TOC, conceal the complexity of new computers with special format files and develop some new instructions which send the specified file to the specified processor to use the new computer. On the basis of this theory, the concept of “structured data computer”, the “SZG file” and the “SZG file instruction” are elaborated in this article. Finally, the example is given of processing structured data with four groups of different types. Verify the effectiveness of the programming platform by analyzing the computational process of 1000 pairs of structured data. Experimental results show that the programming platform is running well and stable and the strong capacity of the TOC for processing structured data is exhibited.
