We, in this paper, examined whether computer-based repository could augment organizational memory in learning from failure. Computer based repository in general enhances organizational memory, but paradoxical effects are also assumed in the other paper. Since knowledge information is stored in a computer-based repository, organization members do not always have to memorize in their brain, so it could not strengthen organizational memory. We found through the questionnaire survey in the company where a well-organized computer repository was routinely used; (1) The computer-based repository augmented both of soft memory such as brain memory, and hard memory such as written document, (2) The soft memory had a significant positive effect on organizational memory, but (3) The hard memory did not have a significant effect on organizational memory.
