Architecture is a technology-intensive discipline. It uses technology, both in the process of design and also in production. It is believed that digital computer technology has a strong impact on architectural design, architectural teaching as well as in practice. Image architecture, digital simulation and virtual scene among other applications have gradually become progressive architectural design phrases. There exists a necessity that architectural teaching should adapt to such transformations.
With the rapid development of computer applications in the architectural profession, the need to find a framework to integrate the computer applications with architectural curriculum has increased. Hence, it became mandatory to examine the computer integration’s impact on architectural schools, at the same time explore the architecture profession’s needs in order to help find an efficient framework for architectural education.
This paper studies the integration of computer applications in the top 20 international architecture schools as well as in eight architectural departments in Egyptian universities, with the aim of understanding the current educational status nationally and internationally. A survey was conducted on a sample of architects in order to investigate the profession needs in various architectural fields. The study is carried out to bridge the gap between architectural education and architectural profession.
