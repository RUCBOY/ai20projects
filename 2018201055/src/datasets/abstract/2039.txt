Learning computer programming requires problem-solving skills, coding skills and algorithmic skills which are complex and difficult to master. Computer programming is difficult because of its essence in creating a solution that requires translating it in a language understood only by the computer. This poses barriers like anxiety, panic, stress, grief and frustration to novice programmers. The purpose of this study was to design and develop a gamified content for selected topics of basic Java computer programming for freshman college students of Mindanao State University Tawi-Tawi College of Technology and Oceanography. The game follows the Player-Centered, Iterative, Interdisciplinary and Integrated framework. The idea of using Gamification was adopted in the development of the gamified content. The game was evaluated using Octalysis by seven subject experts from the Institute of Information and Communications Technology. The overall rating of the game resulted to have proper motivation for Gamification.
