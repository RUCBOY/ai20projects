The importance of technology in the workplace has been, and continues to be, on an upward trajectory. Technological progress allows more and more functions once performed by humans to be automated. Theoretical conceptualizations in human-computer interaction (HCI) covered the evolution of computers from ‘tools’ to ‘partners’ in interaction with humans at work. However, nowadays computers have also begun to take over leadership functions, guiding and commanding human workers. We argue that conceptual coverage is in danger of falling short of this development and the implied profound change in hierarchy.
To close this gap, we propose the paradigm of ‘computers as leaders’ and call for a scientific discourse of computers performing leadership functions. Building on research in HCI and human-human leadership, we suggest a definition of computer-human leadership and a respective structural model, entangling interaction roles of the different human and computer agents involved. Moreover, we discuss criteria for evaluating automated leadership systems and questions of function allocation, before we bring our propositions together in a theoretical model depicting how humans come to accept and follow a computer leader. Finally, we discuss implications of the proposed paradigm and call for awareness of ethical issues.
