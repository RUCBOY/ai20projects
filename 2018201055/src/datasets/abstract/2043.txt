This paper proposes a new charge structure, which can form a penetrator with enhanced lateral effect (PELE) or explosively formed projectile (EFP) by different initiation modes. The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamic response and aftereffect of the charge liner under explosive load in PELE mode. To this end, the computer modeling and simulation analysis method was used to simulate the forming and penetrating target progress of the PELE formed by charge liner. The results indicated that the ANSYS/LS-DYNA finite element software could accurately simulate the formation of PELE and the damage process to the target, and we could obtain exact forming and damage data by this method. The PELE damage element could be formed by the new charge structure liner under explosive load, its velocity was 2050 m/s, the head-to-tail velocity gradient was only 20 m/s, the length of damage element was 63.62 mm, and the length-diameter ratio was 1.79. And PELE damage element could effectively damage 15 mm target, the inlet opening hole diameter of the target was measured to be 68 mm, the outlet diameter was 72 mm. This finding could serve a technical basis for computer modeling and simulation technology of charge structure.
