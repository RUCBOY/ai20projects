Object caches are used to minimize data traffic in various areas of Information Technology, including computer networks. In this scenario, they are usually hosted in proxies, storing page objects (texts, figures, among others), and implementing access control policies. Its correct operation can provide a significant gain of performance in data exchange since it allows the immediate response of requested resources. This study aims to discuss the different states of the efficiency of two distinct types of computer network caches and determine the changing dynamics of these states with Logic EÏ„.
