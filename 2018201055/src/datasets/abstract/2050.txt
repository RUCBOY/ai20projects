The experiments and computer research on the issue of metamaterials [6-9,11,14] allow a dedicated parts or even whole devices designing using 3D CAD technology and Finite Element Methods. Research and their effects aim at replacing the mechanisms by means of elements perform by additive technology with different internal geometry in terms of dimensions and shapes, while maintaining identical dimensions in such a way that the desired abbreviated motion. In order to do that the adequate computer model [15-24] using for fast and effective prototyping is desired. The initial steps to achieve this aim is shown in this work.
