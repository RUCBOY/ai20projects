In the production of automotive gauge, one of the most important step is to test the meters on the dashboard some of which are needle meters. Based on computer vision technology, a dynamic automatic reading value test method is presented in the paper. With a hardware in the loop (HIL) platform simulating the actual vehicle running state and providing sensor signals or data via CAN(controller area network) bus for the tested automotive dashboard, the needle meters of the dashboard are tested by comparing the input and indication which is obtained through image process method. As the core technology of the method, how to read the indication of the needle meters automatically is expounded in detail. The proposed method is tested on an experimental system which is composed of a HIL platform based on VECTOR dSpace and a computer vision equipment including several MV-VS078FC cameras. The HIL and vision parts can coordinately work to fulfil the automatic test procedure. The meters can be dynamically driven and precisely automaticly read out.
