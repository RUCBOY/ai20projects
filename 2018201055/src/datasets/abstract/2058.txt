The paper is devoted to description of the method for computer aided design of consistent real-time spacecraft onboard control algorithms. This kind of control algorithms should organize synchronized cooperation of different onboard apparatus and functional software for successful completion of space exploration mission. We introduce the mathematical models for onboard resources, equipment and apparatus, and for real-time control algorithm to be implemented by onboard real-time software. The important feature of the proposed model is considering that each onboard apparatus consumes some onboard resources, thus consistent control algorithm must not violate limits of these resources. There is discussion devoted to construction of effective and consistent real-time control algorithm which guarantees completion of the mission in case of limited accessible onboard energy, computer power, etc. We also present the specially developed CAD/CASE tool allowing automated checking of existing algorithms whether they violate the resource constraints as well as design of new algorithms from scratch.
