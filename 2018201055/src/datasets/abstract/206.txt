The model of a simple self-reproducing system has been investigated. The current model has been developed in the framework of syser systems. The term syser is the abbreviation of the words “SYstem of SElf-Reproduction”. The syser model can be considered as a reasonable model of the prebiological macromolecular self-reproducing systems. The syser includes a polynucleotide matrix, a replication enzyme, a translation enzyme, and other enzymes and protein. Earlier, we studied the model of sysers with a large number of macromolecules. However, a large number of macromolecules is a certain disadvantage of models of prebiological systems. In order to overcome this disadvantage, a new syser model with a small number of macromolecules has been constructed and investigated in the present work. The macromolecules of the syser are located inside the protocell. Additionally, we consider special macromolecules that provide sysers with energy. There is a mechanism for duplication of protocells. We consider the evolution of the population of sysers. The dynamics of macromolecules in protocells and evolution of sysers populations have been analyzed by means of computer simulation. It was shown that during the evolution of the sysers population, the comparative number and rate of synthesis of macromolecules, which provide protocells with energy, could be increased. The decrease of the synthesis rate of polynucleotide matrices is also possible.
