Several prototype vision-based approaches have been developed to capture and recognize unsafe behavior in construction automatically. Vision-based approaches have been difficult to use due to their inability to identify individuals who commit unsafe acts when captured using digital images/video. To address this problem, we applied a novel deep learning approach that utilizes a Spatial and Temporal Attention Pooling Network to remove redundant information contained in a video to enable a person’s identity to be automatically determined. The deep learning approach we have adopted focuses on: (1) extracting spatial feature maps using the spatial attention network; (2) extracting temporal information using the temporal attention networks; and (3) recognizing a person’s identity by computing the distance between features. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the adopted deep learning approach, we created a database of videos that contained people performing their work on construction sites, conducted an experiment, and then performed k-fold cross-validation. The results demonstrated that the approach could accurately identify a person’s identity from videos captured from construction sites. We suggest that our computer-vision approach can potentially be used by site managers to automatically recognize those individuals that engage in unsafe behavior and therefore be used to provide instantaneous feedback about their actions and possible consequences.
