Edge detection is the prior stage to object recognition and considered as a pillar for image processing task. It is a process to detect such locations from images in terms of pixels where their intensity changing is abruptly. There are many types of images such as medical images, satellite images, articular images, industrial images, general purpose images etc. X-Ray is a type of medical image in which electronic radiation is passed into the human body to capture image of inner parts for better disease diagnoses by orthopaedics or radiologist. In this research paper, we have proposed an improved method to detect edges from human being's X-Ray images based on Gaussian filter and statistical range. Gaussian filter is used for image preprocessing and enhancement. Whereas, Statistical range is used to calculate difference between maximum and minimum pixels from every 3X3 image matrix partition. These two can work to detect edges from X-Ray images. We have also presented a comprehensive comparison of our proposed method with four existing latest methods/algorithms of edge detection. Apart from X-Ray images, experiments have also been conducted on human X-Ray images to detect edges. Further, we have found that our proposed method is superior in terms of MSE, RMSE, PSNR and computation time to detect edges from X-Ray images of human being.
