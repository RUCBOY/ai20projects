This paper considers a model of a toroidal computer interconnection network with the virtual cut-through routing. The interrelationships between network parameters, load and performance are analyzed. An exact analytical expression for the saturation point and expressions for the latency as a function of the message generation rate under the mean field theory approximation have been obtained. The theoretical results have been corroborated with the results of simulation experiments for various values of network parameters. The network behavior has been found not depending on the torus linear dimensions provided that they are at least twice as large as the message path length. The saturation point has been found to be inversely proportional to the message length in good agreement with the analytical results. A good agreement with Littleâ€™s theorem has been found if the network remains in the steady state during the experiment.
