This study investigated the surgical outcomes and accuracy of computer-assisted osteotomy guides and pre-bent titanium plates in the treatment of patients with facial asymmetry. Thirteen patients with facial asymmetry undergoing bimaxillary orthognathic surgery were included. Virtual simulation of Le Fort I osteotomy, sagittal split ramus osteotomy, and genioplasty, if needed, was conducted on the preoperative three-dimensional model. Computer-assisted osteotomy guides and pre-bent titanium plates were produced and used in the actual operation. The postoperative outcome was assessed for facial symmetry and surgical accuracy. All patients were followed up for at least 18 months and their level of satisfaction was investigated. Use of the computer-assisted osteotomy guides and pre-bent titanium plates was successful in all patients. Maxillary canting, mandibular ramus inclination, and mandibular length were corrected on both sides postoperatively. Superimposition of the surgical simulation and postoperative images demonstrated favourable accuracy. Quantitative analysis revealed a mean linear difference of <0.60 mm in the maxilla and 1.57 mm in the mandible. All patients were satisfied with the surgical outcome; there were no complications or cases of relapse during follow-up. The application of computer-assisted osteotomy guides and pre-bent titanium plates achieved favourable outcomes and accuracy, improving planning for the correction of facial asymmetry.
