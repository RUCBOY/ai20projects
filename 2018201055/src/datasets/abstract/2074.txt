Designing of logistics systems with using computer simulation and emulation is the main part of effective optimization of manufacturing and warehousing in the company. Latest developments in software tools lead to research in use of computer simulation and emulation, before, during and after logistics system designing. The aim of our research is to describe the logistics system designing by using of computer simulation and emulation with connecting on real parts of logistic system. Through this connection, we can propose a material flow which could improve the speed and accuracy of picking of orders in warehouse or supplies of material to manufacturing. Solution described in this article has many practical applications in companyâ€™s operation. Future work will explore the possibility of connecting between computer simulation, emulation and Digital Twin.
