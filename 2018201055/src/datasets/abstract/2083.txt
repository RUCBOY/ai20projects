The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of a computer-based simulated learning environment on student learning in speech-language pathology. Despite a growing trend in the implementation of computer-based simulated learning environments, no research yet supports its efficacy. In addition, although over half of the United Statesâ€™ speech-language pathologists work in school systems, no studies have investigated simulated learning environments that focus on pediatric developmental language disorders as the disorder to be exemplified by the simulations.
Four different cohorts of students (103 total students) received either a traditional learning experience or a computer-based simulation experience in a graduate level school-aged language disorders course. Groups were equivalent in academic performance and pre-experimental knowledge. Pre- and post-experimental measures of learning were obtained.
Findings demonstrated that the group that was involved with the simulated learning environment outperformed the traditional instruction group in several key areas associated with clinically-based educational outcomes.
Simulated learning environments continue to be a positive innovation in the clinical education of speech-language pathology students. Implications potentially affect educational models of speech-language pathology.
