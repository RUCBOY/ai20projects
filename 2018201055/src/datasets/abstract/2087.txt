Children with epilepsy often show deficits in attention and visuospatial functions. Still, very few systematically controlled evidence-based pediatric neurorehabilitation methods exist. The aim was to assess the effectiveness of a computer-based rehabilitation program for visuospatial deficit remediation in children with epilepsy.
Fifty-eight children aged 8–12 years participated: 17 children with epilepsy diagnosis in intervention group, 22 patients in waiting-list control group, and 19 healthy age equivalent controls. The intervention group received guided visuospatial functions rehabilitation with FORAMENRehab software twice a week for a 5-week period. Baseline assessments were carried out before and immediately after the intervention period, and as follow-up 1.31 years later. Intervention group showed positive immediate rehabilitation effect in 3 out of 4 visuospatial components: visual organization, visual attention, and visuospatial perception. A long-term rehabilitation effect in the study group was observed in all 4 of the trained components. Also, a positive generalized effect was confirmed by the parents' and children's qualitative feedback with some of the improved skills transferring to children's everyday life. One hundred percent compliance further confirmed the children's motivation to participate and the effectiveness of FORAMENRehab for pediatric neurorehabilitation.
