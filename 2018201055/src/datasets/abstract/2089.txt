In order to control dust in a tunnel boring machine (TBM) construction tunnels, this paper, in combination with field measurements, applies CFD computer simulation technology to study the dust control effect of TBM construction tunnels under different dust extraction flow rates. Firstly, the dust extraction system is closed, and the result of the simulation show that the dust diffuses to the entire TBM working area within 181 s, indicating the necessity of having a dust extraction system in the tunnel. Secondly, the dust extraction system is open and under the original dust extraction flow rate of Qe = 8 m3/s, the overall dust diffuses to the entire working area Lo = 130 m, and the full-face dust diffusion distance is Lf = 47.54 m. Then the study was carried out with the setting of 2 m3/s ≤ Qe ≤ 14 m3/s. The results show that: when Qe ≤ 8 m3/s, the full-face dust diffuses to 47.54–71.84 m; when Qe > 8 m3/s, the full-face dust can be controlled at 42.81–46.34 m; and when Qe = 8 m3/s, the full-face dust control effect is better, and the average dust concentration in the tunnel is as low as 12.25 mg/m3, indicating that the original dust extraction system has a better design. The field measurement results verify that the CFD computer simulation results are accurate.
