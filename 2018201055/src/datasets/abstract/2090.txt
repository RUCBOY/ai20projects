This paper aims to combat the haphazard manual process involved in building-erection planning and the associated lag in productivity growth by pointing industry stakeholders to the tools suited for their needs. It identifies 28 computer-assisted building construction scheduling tools that require no special skills and automate at least one step of the scheduling. Resulting from a systematic literature review of industry-related papers published between January 2008 and 2018, this work will guide construction practitioners through an array of tools classified according to their interface, inputs, and outputs, and will serve as the basis for further development in construction automation.
