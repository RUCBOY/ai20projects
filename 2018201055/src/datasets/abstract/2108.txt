The arrangement graph An,k is regarded as an attractive interconnection network in multiprocessor computer system. The subsystem-reliability (s-reliability) is defined as the probability that a fault-free subgraph of a specific size is still available, and is able to measure the health state of the system. In this paper, we mainly consider the comparison of two different topologies of arrangement graphs with the same number of processors and the robustness of reliability bounds of arrangement graph. Further, we prove that the larger n is, the higher s-reliability of An,k will be, and provide a theoretical basis for finding the topology of more reliable arrangement graph with the same number of processors. The simulation is carried out to verify the robustness of reliability bounds and comparison of more pairs of arrangement graph.
