This article employs qualitative coding methods to trace ebbs and flows of technofeminist and intersectional values and practices in almost three decades of scholarship in Computers and Composition (C&C). Using an explanatory, sequential, mixed-methods research approach, we examine both implicit and explicit orientations to intersectional and technofeminist frameworks. Our findings suggest that as the field of computers and writing moves forward, the practices and values of feminist orientations should be made more explicit or apparent in C&C. Proposed solutions include: 1) recognizing that intersectional and technofeminist epistemologies are central to the work of computers and writing; 2) foregrounding these frameworks in our classrooms and pedagogies; and 3) considering how technofeminist and intersectional practices inform emerging research in areas such as posthumanism, object-oriented ontology, rhetorical code studies, algorithmic rhetorics, and game theory.
