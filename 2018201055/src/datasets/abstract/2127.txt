The article describes the possibility of application of computer on the process of planning and scheduling in Kosovo Enterprises. We have investigated job shop scheduling on the shop floor of the machining operation. Furthermore, particular attention is dedicated to the schedule activities in such a way to use equipment and all resources available in an efficient manner. For solving our problems, we have used the program package “LEKIN®” and Genetic Algorithm-GA for process planning and scheduling to demonstrate how planning and scheduling techniques will help Kosovo enterprises to optimize their processes.
