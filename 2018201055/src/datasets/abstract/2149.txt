In this study, we demonstrate a practical synthetic hologram with a size of 30 mm × 30 mm at resolution of 94340 × 94340. The high-definition large-scale computer-generated full-parallax synthetic hologram is achieved through frequency mosaic with different perspective images. The sparsity characteristics mosaic frequency of full parallax synthetic hologram is analyzed for reducing the complexity of computation. Following elimination of the sparsity, the hologram is calculated by normalization of 2D inverse Fourier transform of the mosaic frequency. The error and object point size are analyzed and we conclude that the error is sufficiently small for human visual perception given that parallax angle and object depth are within acceptable limits.
