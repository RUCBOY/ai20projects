In [R. Heckmann, K. Keimel, Quasicontinuous Domains and the Smyth Powerdomain, Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science 298 (2013), 215–232], Heckmann and Keimel proved that a dcpo P is quasicontinuous iff the poset Fin P of nonempty finitely generated upper sets ordered by reverse inclusion is continuous. We generalize this result to general topological spaces in this paper. More precisely, for any T0 space (X,τ) and U∈τ, we construct a topology τF generated by the basic open subsets UF={↑F∈FinX:F⊆U}. It is shown that a T0 space (X,τ) is a hypercontinuous lattice iff τF is a completely distributive lattice. In particular, we prove that if a poset P satisfies property DINTop, then P is quasi-hypercontinuous iff Fin P is hypercontinuous.
