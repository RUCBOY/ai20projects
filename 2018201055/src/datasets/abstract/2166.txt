One of the typical problems of modern high speed transport is its energy efficiency. Vehicle air resistance makes a major part of them. Usually, attention is put on the vehicle front part geometry and cross-section size. But air flow around rotating parts, especially brake discs, has significant impact on the overall air resistance, too. On one hand, the air flow through brake discs is needed for cooling. On the other hand it causes significant energy losses, when disc cooling is not needed. Research in the field of disc cooling channels can result in minimizing of this air flow resistance. Authors deal with estimating the brake disc resistance by both computer simulation analysis and by experiment on special test rig. In this paper, special test rig and proposed measurement process are described. Obtained results are compared with computer simulations.
