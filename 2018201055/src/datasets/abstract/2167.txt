To investigate the effect of computer-assisted virtual operation planning (CAVOP) on anterior controllable anterior-displacement and fusion (ACAF) surgery for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL).
A total of 25 patients with OPLL were enrolled in the study from September 2017 to December 2017. Preoperative Computed tomography (CT) scanning data were input into Mimics software to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) models of actual cervical OPLL.Preoperative simulation of each surgical procedure and measurement of main parameters for intraoperative decision were conducted. Postoperative CT were used to test the clinical value of the preoperative planning. Width of vertebrae-OPLL complex (VOC), thickness of resected vertebral body (VB), height of intervertebral spacer, and length of screws and anterior plate were analyzed.
There were no significant differences between the length of screws, width of VOC, and thickness of anterior resection of vertebrae in preoperative CT and postoperative CT. Statistical differences were found between preoperative and postoperative height of intervertebral space and length of anterior plate.
A virtual ACAF surgical procedure for OPLL is feasible and useful clinically in surgical planning. It may provide a valuable tool for surgeons in formulating an appropriate surgical plan.
