Previous studies have reported the importance of metacognition on learning performance. However, little effort has been made to develop group metacognitive scaffolding (GMS) in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments. The present study sought to extend current understandings of scaffolding in CSCL, by examining the effects of GMS on group metacognitive behavior, group performance, and cognitive load in CSCL environments. In total, 111 college students participated in the study. Participants were divided into small groups and assigned to experimental and control conditions. Students in the experimental group received GMS during an online collaborative learning process, while those in the control group performed online collaborative learning without GMS. The results indicated that GMS had significant impacts on group metacognitive behavioral transition and group performance. Moreover, GMS did not increase students' cognitive load. The results of this study and their implications for teachers and developers are discussed.
