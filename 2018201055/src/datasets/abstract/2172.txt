By keeping track of lists of specific bonds one wishes to preserve, a computer program is able to identify the key disconnections used in the patented syntheses and design synthetic routes that circumvent these approaches. Here, we provide examples of computer-designed syntheses relevant to medicinal chemistry, in which the machine avoids “strategic” disconnections common to industrial patents and is forced to use different starting materials. The ability of modern retrosynthetic planners to navigate around patented solutions may have significant implications for the ways in which intellectual property related to multistep syntheses is protected and/or challenged.
