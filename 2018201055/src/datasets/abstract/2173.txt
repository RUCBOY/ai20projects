This paper discusses the effect of the application of three-dimensional computer-aided design (3D-CAD) on the creative self-efficacy and performance of student designers. A nonequivalent pretest–posttest quasi-experimental design was applied, and 164 students from a high school in Taipei City were sampled. The conclusions are summarized as follows: 1. Low–moderate positive correlations were identified between the total score and individual items of the creative self-efficacy of the students and those of the creative performance of the students. 2. Using 3D-CAD significantly enhanced the creative performance of the students, particularly the usefulness of their products. 3. Using 3D-CAD strengthened the creative self-efficacy of the students, particularly in countering external negative assessment of their creative products with positive beliefs.
