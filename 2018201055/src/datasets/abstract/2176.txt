Game theory is a mathematical model which deals with interactions between various entities by analyzing the strategies and choices. In todayâ€™s world, Game Theory is being extensively used in fields like economics, sociology, political science, etc. due to its versatile nature and applications in myriad of conflicts and problems. The application of game theory has been extended to computer science also due to its versatility and robustness. In this paper we have discussed the applications of game theory in fields of cyber security and cloud computing along with the comparative study of different game models used in their respective fields. We have also discussed about Compositional Game Theory and its applications for solving complex problems.
