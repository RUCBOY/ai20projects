The work presents the results of hot rolling process modeling using three-dimensional numerical modeling based on the DEFORM-3D software package, which is based on the finite element method (FEM). In the process of modeling, the work rolls were considered as absolutely rigid bodies. The number and type of elements were determined on the basis of the geometric features of the workpiece and the accuracy of the calculation. The adequacy of the calculations was determined by comparison with experimental data, semilunar on the current production. Discrepancies left no more than 5%. That allows us to consider the model adequate.
