Cognitive challenges that are presented through the modification of established design principles may contribute to learning. One such challenge to the promotion of deeper processing is the Disfluency Effect. Specifically, disfluency manipulations in learning materials interfere with the perceptional fluency, which may in turn lead to better learning outcomes. This likelihood of reaching better learning outcomes through minor instructional modifications has led scholars to investigate the construct further. Accordingly, the effect of fluency modifications on learning outcomes, metacognitive judgments and cognitive load is investigated in the current study with a true experiment conducted with 292 undergraduate students who were assigned randomly to one of the six disfluency scenarios in a computer-based learning environment. Additional variables were also considered such as the working memory capacity, prior knowledge and cognitive load. Significant differences were observed with regard to the extraneous cognitive load, while there was no variation in the learning outcomes and metacognitive judgments in the experimental groups. Moreover, significant relationships were observed between cognitive load, the number of animations watched by the students and the learning outcomes. The results were interpreted in accordance with the approach in contemporary studies into the Disfluency Effect, and theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
