The gold standard in biomedical research is the multi-center, multi-blinded, randomized control trial (RCT). In pharmacological research the RCT is termed a Phase III clinical trial. This paper presents the core goals and RCT methods developed to investigate automated spirit presence and communication. The goals are: (1) to use currently available, reliable, and affordable technology (total hardware cost per system less than $4,000; these systems will be provided free to collaborating laboratories), (2) to automate data collection and real-time analyses employing specially designed software, (3) to only require a quiet space (used at night) in collaborating laboratories, (4) to not necessitate human subjects committee approvals at collaborating institutions (because the participants are hypothesized spirit participants), and (5) to enable international collaboration regardless of the investigator's personal beliefs about the hypothesis. The research design and methods meet a phrase popularized by Carl Sagan: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” The design minimizes false positives and false negatives. University affiliated investigators in established laboratories who regularly publish in peer reviewed journals, and are interested in collaborating in this RCT, are invited to contact the author.
