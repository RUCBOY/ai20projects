A method of color holographic display from computer-generated cylindrical hologram (CGCH) based on radial-division is proposed. A single phase-only CGCH is calculated by using a multi-cylindrical surface (MCS) based iterative algorithm. This algorithm allows calculating a phase CGCH from red, green and blue components of a color object simultaneously. The radial distances for red, green and blue component objects are calculated according to the ratio of RGB wavelengths. When the hologram is illuminated by three laser beams of RGB colors, it can then reconstruct the wanted RGB components on the same radial position to obtain a color compound. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that simple 3D object can be reconstructed from single phase-only CGCH at the expected position.
