High tibial osteotomy (HTO) is a surgical procedure performed on patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Computer assisted navigated high tibial osteotomy (CAN-HTO) may result in improved outcomes for patients undergoing this procedure.
Retrospective study involving patients undergoing CAN-HTO.
Surveyed thirty-three patients. Average follow-up: 2.3 years. 97% patients reported they would have this procedure performed again, if indicated. Re-operation rate: 6.1% and complication rate: 12.1%. Patients had decreased KOOS for symptoms when compared to non-navigation based HTO (p = 0.000).
There may be merit with the use of CAN-HTO, with demonstrated patient-reported benefits at 2-year follow-up.
