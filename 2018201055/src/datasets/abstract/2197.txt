On-demand resource provisioning and elasticity are two of the main characteristics of the cloud computing paradigm. As a result, the load on a cloud service provider (CSP) is not fixed and almost always a number of its physical resources are not used, called spare resources. As the CSPs typically don't want to be overprovisioned at any time, they procure physical resources in accordance to a pessimistic forecast of their loads and this leads to a large amount of spare resources most of the time. Some CSPs rent their spare resources with a lower price called the spot price, which varies over time with respect to the market or the internal state of the CSP. In this paper, we assume the spot price to be a function of the CSP's load. We introduce the concept of a parasite CSP, which rents spare resources from several CSPs simultaneously with spot prices and rents them to its customers with an on-demand price lower than the host CSPs' on-demand prices. We propose the overall architecture and interaction model of the parasite CSP. Mathematical analysis has been made to calculate the amount of spare resources of the host CSPs, the amount of resources that the parasite CSP can rent (its virtual capacity) as well as the probability of SLA violations. We evaluate our analysis over pricing data gathered from Amazon EC2 services. The results show that if the parasite CSP relies on several host CSPs, its virtual capacity can be considerable and the expected penalty due to SLA violation is acceptably low.
