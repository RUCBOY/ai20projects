Microstructure of as-cast, quenched and tempered high sulfur steels was observed, and the sulfides in different heat treatment states were analyzed by professional image software Image Pro Plus. The results show that the matrix structure of high sulfur steel before heat treatment is mainly composed of lamellar pearlite and ferrite distributed along grain boundaries. The sulfide mainly distributes in the matrix in the form of flocculent, spherical, long strip and spindle. The distribution of sulfide in high sulfur steel before heat treatment is not uniform and the overall bearing capacity is not uniform. It has poor capability and wear resistance, and is not suitable for high speed and heavy load. Statistical analysis of sulfides in high sulfur steel before and after heat treatment by Image Pro Plus software shows that the average size of sulfides increases and the number decreases after quenching, while the average size decreases and the number increases after tempering. The matrix hardness of high sulfur steel after tempering is lower than that after quenching, but the hardness of sulfide after tempering do not change much; the hardness of high sulfur steel after quenching or tempering are get the maximum when quenching temperature is 840 °C.
