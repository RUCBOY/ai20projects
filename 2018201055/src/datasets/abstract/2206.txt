In this paper, we investigate the properties of almost algebraic domains introduced by G. Hamrin and V. Stoltenberg-Hansen in 2006. We introduce a notion of M-closed basis and define a new class of domains, called ωAML-domains, which are continuous L-domains endowed with countable, almost algebraic, and M-closed bases. The main result of this paper is: the class of ωAML-domains is closed under function spaces and finite cartesian products. Hence, the category of ωAML-domains together with Scott continuous functions is cartesian closed. The results of this paper give an answer to an open problem posed by G. Hamrin and V. Stoltenberg-Hansen in “Two categories of effective continuous cpos, Theoretical Computer Science, 365 (2006), 216–236”.
