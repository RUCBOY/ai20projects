Immersion tests in purified water were conducted to evaluate the leaching behaviors of filler elements contained in computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) composite resin.
Four commercial CAD/CAM resin composite blanks were tested: Shofu block HC 2 layer, Cerasmart, Katana Avencia block, and KZR-CAD HR Block 2. The specimens in the size of 10.0 × 12.0 × 2.0 mm were immersed in a 50-mL conical tube containing 40 mL of purified water, and then placed in a constant-temperature oven set at a temperature of 37, 60, 70, or 80° C and stored statically for 30 days. After storage, the concentrations of leached elements in the immersion solution were measured with an inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. To characterize the surface of the specimen after the immersion test, secondary electron images were obtained.
The immersion test resulted in the leaching of Si, the main component, from all materials tested. Some materials were found to have leached high amount of Ba or Sr in addition to Si, and remarkable surface degradation was observed. The amount of leached elements increased with increased immersion temperatures.
Filler elements in CAD/CAM composite resins used in this study leached into purified water. The leached elements and its quantities greatly differed among materials and depend on the types of the oxides composing the filler. The amounts of leached elements varied in a temperature-dependent manner.
