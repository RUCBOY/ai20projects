The computer-generated holograms (CGH) are the core component to solve the problem of complex surface measurement. Pattern distortion is an important error source that affects its testing accuracy. This paper presents an evaluation method for the influence of pattern distortion on wavefront error. Firstly, the technical means of characterizing pattern information of CGH by optical element detection system was expounded. Then, the simulation model of wavefront error distribution was established to study the effect of pattern distortion on CGH testing accuracy. Finally, we verified the feasibility of the evaluation method based on the experimental research.
