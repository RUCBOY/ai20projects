Exposure to high levels of metals/metalloids may impair semen quality. Computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) can be used for kinematic analysis of spermatozoa, which provides additional insights into sperm motion characteristics.
To explore the associations of urinary and seminal plasma metal/metalloid concentrations with CASA motion parameters and assess the degree of correspondence between the two sample types.
Eighteen metals/metalloids in seminal plasma and repeated urine samples were determined among 746 men recruited from a reproductive center. We assessed their associations with 6 CASA motion parameters [i.e., straight-line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP), linearity (LIN), straightness (STR) and amplitude head displacement (ALH)] using multivariable linear regression models.
We found significantly inverse dose-dependent relationships between seminal plasma arsenic (As) and VSL, VCL and VAP, between seminal plasma selenium (Se) and VSL and VAP, between seminal plasma zinc (Zn) and STR and LIN, and between seminal plasma manganese (Mn) and LIN in single-metal models [all false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted P for trend < 0.05]. These dose-response relationships remained statistically significant based on multiple-metal models and restricted cubic spline functions. Metal/metalloid concentrations in urine poorly predicted the same-day seminal plasma concentrations [coefficient of determination (R2) < 0.15]. We didn't find any significant associations between urinary metal/metalloid concentrations and the CASA motion parameters.
Exposure to high levels of As, Se, Mn and Zn may impair sperm motion capacity. Concentrations of metals/metalloids in spot urine samples cannot accurately predict same-day seminal plasma exposure levels.
