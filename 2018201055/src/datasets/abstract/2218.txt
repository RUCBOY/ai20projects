The purpose of this study was to evaluate the marginal gaps of dental restorations manufactured using conventional loss wax and casting, computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM), and 3D printing methods.
A zirconia master die model with an upper right first molar resin crown was prepared as a standardized model. A total of 30 resin master die models were duplicated from this standard model. Simultaneously, 10 CoCrMo metal crowns were individually obtained using the conventional loss wax and casting method (Group A), selective laser sintering (Group B), and CAD/CAM (Group C), respectively. The marginal gaps between the crowns fabricated conventional and digital methods with master die models were calculated using a 3D replica and mapping technique.
Statistical analyses revealed there were significant differences in the marginal gaps in the group A with group B and C (p < 0.05). The mean marginal gaps between dental crowns with die models were 76 ± 61 μm, 116 ± 92 μm, and 121 ± 98 μm for groups A, B, and C, respectively.
Within the limitations of this study, the marginal gaps were clinical acceptable in conventional and digital techniques.
