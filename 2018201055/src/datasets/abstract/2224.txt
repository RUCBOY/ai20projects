This article focuses on the possibilities of intelligent camera systems based on a virtual instrumentation within the "SMART City" concept. The application areas of modern camera systems are discussed. The original benefit of the study is the real implantation of a modular camera system within the unique BroadbandLIGHT testing area (parking lot of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Technical University of Ostrava, Czech Republic). Both hardware compotes and designed software for working with cameras are thoroughly analyzed.
