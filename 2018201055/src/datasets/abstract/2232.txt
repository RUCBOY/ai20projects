This paper deals with teaching the first and only logic control course for 2nd year students (after the high school diploma) in computer science by using HOME I/O, the virtual house for control and STEM education and Scratch 2.0. HOME I/O is a fruitful collaboration between CReSTIC lab from the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne and Real Games, a Portuguese company. In this paper, it is shown how HOME I/O combined with Scratch 2.0 has been used to present the main concepts of logic control. From a pedagogical point of view, an original approach based on learning from errors have been developed. After 2 years of experience, feedback from students and teachers have been very positive.
