Researchers have studied on why individuals choose to be entrepreneur, and one of the theories used to explain the reason to be an entrepreneur is Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). In this respect, the aim of this research was determined as how well TPB would predict entrepreneurial intention (EI) and whether or not social sciences and natural sciences undergraduate students differentiate in terms of their entrepreneurial intentions. The universe of the study consists of social sciences and natural sciences undergraduates studying at Bahçeşehir University. In this regard, a survey was conducted with 391 undergraduate students via using random sampling method. 200 participants were from Economics, Administrative and Social Sciences Faculty, and 191 were from Engineering and Natural Sciences Faculty. In this research, Entrepreneurial Intention Questionnaire (EIQ) developed by Linan and Chen (2009) was used to measure EI and to determine the factors affecting EI. This scale has three independent variables as Personal Attitudes (PA), Subjective Norm (SN) and Perceived Behavioural Control (PBC). For data analysis, SPSS 22.0 computer program was used. According to the results, for social sciences students, natural sciences students and total number of students, PA and PBC affect EI positively. Moreover, for natural sciences students, SN also influences EI. Furthermore, for social sciences students, natural sciences students and total number of students, SN affects PA and PBC positively.
