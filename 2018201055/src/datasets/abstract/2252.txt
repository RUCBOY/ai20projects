Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is a newly developed three-dimensional tomographic imaging modality in the field of breast cancer screening designed to alleviate the limitations of conventional digital mammography-based breast screening methods. A computer-aided detection (CAD) system was designed for masses in DBT using a faster region-based convolutional neural network (faster-RCNN). To this end, a data set was collected, including 89 patients with 105 masses. An efficient detection architecture of convolution neural network with a region proposal network (RPN) was used for each slice to generate region proposals (i.e., bounding boxes) with a mass likelihood score. In each DBT volume, a slice fusion procedure was used to merge the detection results on consecutive 2D slices into one 3D DBT volume. The performance of the CAD system was evaluated using free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curves. Our RCNN-based CAD system was compared with a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN)-based CAD system. The RCNN-based CAD generated a performance with an area under the ROC (AUC) of 0.96, whereas the DCNN-based CAD achieved a performance with AUC of 0.92. For lesion-based mass detection, the sensitivity of RCNN-based CAD was 90% at 1.54 false positive (FP) per volume, whereas the sensitivity of DCNN-based CAD was 90% at 2.81 FPs/volume. For breast-based mass detection, RCNN-based CAD generated a sensitivity of 90% at 0.76 FP/breast, which is significantly increased compared with the DCNN-based CAD with a sensitivity of 90% at 2.25 FPs/breast. The results suggest that the faster R-CNN has the potential to augment the prescreening and FP reduction in the CAD system for masses.
