Due to increased sedentary workstyles, active workstations have shown the ability to increase activity while only moderately affecting work ability. However, previous examinations have not examine fine motor mousing tasks on tripping descriptors.
What affect do mousing tasks of varying target size have on tripping descriptors during walking workstation use?
Three-dimensional kinematic data were collected while participants used a walking workstation completing one baseline and three mousing conditions of varying target sizes.
Target size main effects (p < 0.001) detected decreased stride length in all experimental conditions, which were supported by moderate effect sizes, and decreased stance width and time in double limb support (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). Stance width differences resulted in large effect sizes between baseline and all conditions, while only moderate effect sizes were observed between time in double limb support in baseline compared to all conditions. No changes in knee flexion range of motion were observed in response to target size (p = 0.278).
These results indicate that walking workstation users shorten their stride length and decrease their base of support while completing mousing tasks. The placement of the upper extremities on the workstation desk likely acted as the primary mechanism to increase stability. It is concluded that performing mousing tasks of varying target size using a walking workstation does not pose greater risk for adverse gait events.
