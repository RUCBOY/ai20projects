Over the many decades of nuclear power development, pursuits of reason and observation, appearing as science- and data-based evaluations, have alternated in priority by technologists as they mutually serve to refine the understanding and utility of nuclear science. The rapid advancement of both of these methods principles for nuclear applications, among others, has been synergistic with advances in computing. Stimulated by recent data analytics achievements in the realm of computer visualization, machine learning and the internet-of-the-things, this paper reviews the historical trends of science- vs. data-based analytics with a focus on nuclear-thermal-hydraulics modeling and simulation. The benefit of this progress is then presented in terms of its value to the nuclear industry. An underlying assumption is maintained that sustainable progress relative to present-day investment in research and development is only possible where benefits for the commercial nuclear power industry can be realized.
