For the first time, U-Net is adopted to detect the concrete cracks in the present study. Focal loss function is selected as the evaluation function, and the Adam algorithm is applied for optimization. The trained U-Net is able of identifying the crack locations from the input raw images under various conditions (such as illumination, messy background, width of cracks, etc.) with high effectiveness and robustness. In addition, U-Net based concrete crack detection method proposed in the present study is compared with the DCNN-based method, and U-Net is found to be more elegant than DCNN with more robustness, more effectiveness and more accurate detection. Furthermore, by examining the fundamental parameters representing the performance of the method, the present U-Net is found to reach higher accuracy with smaller training set than the previous FCNs.
