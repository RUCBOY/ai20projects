Digital representations targeting design and simulation for Additive Manufacturing (AM) are addressed from the perspective of Computer Aided Geometric Design. We discuss the feasibility for multi-material AM for B-rep based CAD, STL, sculptured triangles as well as trimmed and block-structured trivariate locally refined spline representations. The trivariate spline representations support Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), and topology structures supporting these for CAD, IGA and AM are outlined. The ideas of (Truncated) Hierarchical B-splines, T-splines and LR B-splines are outlined and the approaches are compared. An example from the EC H2020 Factories of the Future Research and Innovation Actions CAxMan illustrates both trimmed and block-structured spline representations for IGA and AM.
