EEG is widely used in the brain-computer interface (BCI) systems. Unfortunately, the spatial resolution of EEG is low, due to the volume conduction. This degrades the performance of BCI systems. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this problem, and surface Laplacian is popular among them. In this work, we propose a novel method, local activities estimation (LAE) that enhances the spatial resolution of EEG and improves the overall performance of the BCI system.
In the LAE, the potential caused by sources close to an EEG electrode is estimated by a system of linear equations based on a few definitions and assumptions.
The experimental results on both 64-channel and 32-channel motor imagery data from publicly available BCI Competition datasets indicate the superiority of the LAE over the finite difference Laplacian, spherical spline Laplacian, and common average reference in all tested conditions (p <  0.05).
LAE improves the BCI performance even better than Laplacian methods.
unlike the finite difference Laplacian, LAE does not have uncertainty in the neighbour electrode selection or high sensitivity to electrode positions. It also does not include mathematical complexity and parameter selection ambiguities of spline Laplacian. LAE is implemented by an easy and low-complexity algorithm.
