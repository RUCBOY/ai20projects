Three high quality red wines – Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Pinot Noir – were used for development of an optimized formulation of a new blended wine called Zvezda Kubani (“The Star of Kuban”). The experimental plan was implemented with the mixture designs and triangular surfaces module in the STATISTICA package. According to the experimental plan, we made and studied 31 variants of wines, including 3 monovariants, 3 mixtures of 2 wines and 25 mixtures of 3 wines. In addition, highly qualified specialists have studied the changes in the mixtures according to the results of a sensory assessment to model the connection between the sensory perception of wine mixtures and the new blended wine formulation. As a result, we developed a mathematically proved formulation of a new blended wine, Zvezda Kubani, containing 48% Merlot, 35% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Pinot Noir. The experimental verification of the suggested composition of the blend proved to be a strong indicator of the experts' sensory assessment.
