Current computing platforms, including HPC, Grid and Cloud computing, offer many computational resources. These platforms can provide the scientific world with on-demand and scalable computing power. However, their use requires advanced computer skills. In our work, we summarize the main problems found by research scientists when they attempt to execute complex software on one or several of these platforms. As a solution to these problems, we propose the Science for Everyone (ScifE) framework, and an intuitive and easy-to-use web interface, to perform scientific experiments on HPC or Cloud platforms. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) has been used to test our proof-of-concept framework as it is a complex scientific software used by many climate researchers. Using our framework, a user can execute CESM with custom parameters with only a few clicks on the web interface. As ScifE is generic, other software can be imported relatively easy to our framework. Additional collaborative tools are being developed for successive versions of ScifE, enhancing the practice of science.
