The availability of and accessibility to adequate diets that meet individual nutritional needs and personal food preferences are key elements to guarantee food security. However, suitable solutions for quick assessments of dietary energy and nutrient intakes, in particular at the individual level, are still not available. Therefore, this study illustrates the validation and application of the recently developed calculator of inadequate micronutrient intake (CIMI) approach within a Ghanaian region. The basic structure of CIMI is formed by food frequency questionnaire findings and food composition tables that are used to identify region-specific food groups. CIMI validation includes the correlation and plotting of results obtained from the analysis of 24 h-Recalls with CIMI and a standard nutrition software (NutriSurvey®). Pearson correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman plots indicate method comparability and thus, the validity of CIMI. In comparison with recommended nutrient intakes developed by the World Health Organization, CIMI shows that dietary needs are largely met in the study region in adult men, women and children under-five. However, inadequate dietary intakes were identified for calcium, riboflavin and folic acid and in some subgroups for iron, zinc, vitamin A, vitamin D and niacin. Due to the user-friendly data entry system and the real-time survey analysis, CIMI will assure fast and valid dietary assessments and represents a first step towards the collection of large-scale datasets on individual dietary intakes. This approach will fill data gaps and serve as a profound basis for stakeholders to recommend appropriate policy to sustainably address nutrient deficiencies through coordinated agriculture for diversified food supplies.
