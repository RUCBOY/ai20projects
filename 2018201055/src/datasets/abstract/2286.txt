Experimental investigation and determination of the operation characteristics of an Annular Centrifugal Contactor/Extractor (ACC/E) with various parameter combinations of fluid load and rotational speed were performed by applying non-invasive Computer Tomography (CT) measurement technique. A laboratory ACC/E is designed and manufactured by 3D rapid prototyping using laser sintering method. Further, to achieve a suitable attenuation contrast in CT images between the aqueous phase (distilled water) and organic phase (n-butanol), 10 wt.-% of potassium iodide is used. Therewith the liquid hold-up in the annular gap and the bottom region as well as the flow pattern and the separation process within the rotating cylinder are quantified in detail. The influence of the rotational speed and the volume flow on the operation characteristics is investigated for the first time in 3D resolution. Especially the visual representation of a dispersion band and wedge is a step forward in research and design issues of ACC/E. Thus, the present study shows impressively how a non-invasive measurement technique helps to understand complex equipment for liquidâ€“liquid separation processes. Finally, the results of this work can be used for validation of CFD simulations and for further design improvement.
