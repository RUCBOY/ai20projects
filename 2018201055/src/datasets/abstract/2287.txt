In current times, Organizations implement Quality Management Systems in search of a greater degree of profitability as well as a continuous improvement in its structure. One of the tools that can be used is Business Process Management Notation (BPMN), since it allows to model, control and improve these systems processes.
The present project main goals are to apply the Business Process Management (BPM) methodology, more specifically, its notation (BPMN) in the modulation of the Food Safety procedures; to streamline the Food Safety process control through the application of a programming system; and to demonstrate that an individual with no training in computer science can model processes using the tool aforementioned.
The results show that this notation is a potential asset to improve and simplify the function of every employee involved in the Food Safety process.
