Lazy evaluations are playing important roles in various fields of computer science including hardware design, programming, decision making. In this paper one of the most known and used fuzzy logic system, the Łukasiewicz logic is considered. Pruning algorithms are presented to quicken the evaluations of logical formulae in Łukasiewicz logic by cutting out those branches of the formula tree that have no influence on the final result for some reasons. Correctness of the algorithm is also proven.
