The field of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) emerged in the area of computer science due to transfer of ideas from biology and developed independently for several decades, enriched with techniques from probability theory, complexity theory and optimization methods. In this paper, we consider some recent results form the EAs theory transferred back into biology. The well-known biotechnological procedure SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) is viewed as an experimental implementation of an evolutionary algorithm. Theoretical bounds on EAs runtime are applied to model SELEX search for a regulatory region consisting of promoter and enhancer sequences. A comparison of theoretical bounds to the results of computational simulation indicates some cases where the theoretical bounds give favorable prediction, while simulation requires prohibitive computational resource.
