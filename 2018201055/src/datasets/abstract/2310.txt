Ontologies are structures of concepts that define a high-level representation of a system or area. They can serve as a foundational understanding for developing or integrating software representations of said system. And while the construction of can be a complex, multi-party exercise, the assessment of ontologies is often defined less on usage and more on completeness and coverage. In manufacturing, ontology development ranges from supply chain to production to design. Owing to the computer science foundations of ontology design and representation, the value or quality of an ontology can be assessed on notions of completeness and coverage. Recently, researchers have posited that usage should factor into the Ontology Lifecycle. Similar to how the market, and not technology, defines the success of a product or technology, this paper will examine how utilization of an ontology can define the value or quality of the ontology
