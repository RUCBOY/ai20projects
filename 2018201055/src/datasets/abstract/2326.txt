Robots have been developed as a result of the merging of various sophisticated technologies such as mechanical engineering, control systems, electronics, and software and they have played a significant role in automating the manufacturing industry. However, their rate of introduction in service sectors, especially the medical and healthcare sectors, is much slower than expected. Technology convergence may be one of the keys to promote the introduction of robots in new sectors e.g., the medical & healthcare sectors.
Technological relatedness including technology convergence has been measured by various methodologies using citation network analysis, clustering, or technology similarity. Although these measurements could identify the overall characteristics of technology convergence, more detailed analyses are required to identify the specific patterns and instances of this convergence. The purpose of this research is first, to identify the technology convergence more precisely than before by using a new methodology named “module-based mining methodology;” second, to extract the patterns of technology convergence; and finally to examine the processes of technology convergence in the field of robotics research. This study would enable researchers and policymakers to achieve accelerated development of new products and services for new sectors including the medical and healthcare market.
