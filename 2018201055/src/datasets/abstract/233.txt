The MapReduce model is widely used to store and process big data in a distributed manner. MapReduce was originally developed for a single tightly coupled cluster of computers. Approaches such as Hierarchical and Geo-Hadoop are designed to address geo-distributed MapReduce processing. However, these methods still suffer from high inter-cluster data transfer over the Internet, which is prohibitive for processing todayâ€™s globally big data. In line with our thinking that there is no need to transfer the entire intermediate results to a single global reducer, we propose Cross-MapReduce, a framework for geo-distributed MapReduce processing. Before any massive data transfer, our proposed method finds a set of best global reducers to minimize transferred data volumes. We propose a graph called Global Reduction Graph (GRG) to determine the number and the locations of the global reducers. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations using a real testbed to demonstrate the effectiveness of Cross-MapReduce. The experimental results show that Cross-MapReduce significantly outperforms the Hierarchical and Geo-Hadoop approaches and reduces the amount of data transfer over the Internet by 40%.
