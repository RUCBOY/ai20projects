Due to technology development related to agricultural production, aircrafts such as the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and technologies such as Multispectral photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, have great potential in supporting some of the pressing problems faced by agricultural production in terms of analysis and testing of variables. This paper reports an experience related to the analysis of a vineyard with multispectral photogrammetry technology and UAVs and it demonstrates its great potential to analyze the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) and the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) applied in the agriculture framework to collect information on the vegetative state of the crop, soil and plant moisture, and biomass density maps of. In addition, the collected information is analyzed with the PIX4D Cloud Computing technology software and its advantages over software that work with other data processing are highlighted. This research shows, therefore, the possibility that efficient plantations can be developed with the use of multispectral photogrammetry and the analysis of digital images from this process.
