Hankel determinants and automatic sequences are two classical subjects widely studied in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science. However, these two topics were considered totally independently, until in 1998, when Allouche, Peyri√®re, Wen and Wen proved that all the Hankel determinants of the Thue-Morse sequence are nonzero. This property allowed Bugeaud to prove that the irrationality exponents of the Thue-Morse-Mahler numbers are exactly 2. Since then, the Hankel determinants of several other automatic sequences, in particular, the paperfolding sequence, the Stern sequence, the period-doubling sequence, are studied by Coons, Vrbik, Guo, Wu, Wen, Bugeaud, Fu, Han, Fokkink, Kraaikamp, and Shallit. On the other hand, it is known that the Hankel determinants of a rational power series are ultimately zero, and the Hankel determinants of a quadratic power series over finite fields are ultimately periodic. It is therefore natural to ask if we can obtain similar results about the Hankel determinants of algebraic series. In the present paper, we provide a partial answer to this question by establishing the automaticity of the reduced Hankel determinants modulo 2 of a family of automatic sequences. As an application of our result, we give upper bounds for the irrationality exponent of a family of automatic numbers.
