Internet of things (IoT) is a developing technology with a lot of scope in the future. It can ease various different tasks for us. On one hand, IoT is useful for us, on the other hand, it has many serious security threats, like data breaches, side-channel attacks, and virus and data authentication. Classical cryptographic algorithms, like the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm, work well under the classical computers. But the technology is slowly shifting towards quantum computing, which has immense processing power and is more than enough to break the current cryptographic algorithms easily. So it is required that we have to design quantum cryptographic algorithms to prevent our systems from security breaches even before quantum computers come in the market for commercial uses. IoT will also be one of the disciplines, which needs to be secured to prevent any malicious activities. In this paper, we review the common security threats in IoT and the presently available solutions with their drawbacks. Then quantum cryptography is introduced with some of its variations. And finally, the analysis has been carried out in terms of the pros and cons of implementing quantum cryptography for IoT security.
