Places classification is one of the points of discussion in the computer vision and robotics community. Some renowned techniques such as local-invariant feature extractors (e.g. Scale-invariant feature transform SIFT, Speeded Up Robust Features SURF), as well as Visual BoW approach were used in place classification problems. Nowadays, deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have the advantages towards computer vision problems including place classification problem. Albeit, there are several renowned datasets existed to help the community to learn the models, there is no publicly exists in places dataset for specifically places in Indonesia. This paper presents methodology to collect data of visual places in Indonesia, learn deep features from the data, and classify visual places in Indonesia. We aims to contribute a large dataset as well as deep learning models of places in Indonesian. There are more than 16K images collected and augmented to build the places (specifically places in Indonesia) dataset. The highest accuracy score achieved by the models is 92%.
