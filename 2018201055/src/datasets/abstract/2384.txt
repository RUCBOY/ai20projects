In this qualitative study, we examined the worldviews that contemporary science teachers demonstrate in relation to the digital revolution. The main goal of the study was to gain insight into participants' worldviews as related to the digital revolution, specifically, the contents and structure of their worldviews.
The data collection method consisted of in-depth interviews with 30 in-service high-school science teachers. Study findings revealed three different categories of the way teachers perceived their own place and role vis-Ã -vis the digital revolution: 1) outside observers; 2) circumspect participants; 3) conscientious participants.
