Sorting a set of unsorted items is a task that happens in computer programming while a computer program has to follow a sequence of precise directions to accomplish that task. In order to find things quickly by making extreme values easy to see, sorting algorithm refers to specifying a technique to arrange the data in a particular order or format where maximum of communal orders is in arithmetic or lexicographical order. A lot of sorting algorithms has already been developed and these algorithms have enhanced the performance in the factors including time and space complexity, stability, correctness, definiteness, finiteness, effectiveness, etc. A new approach has been proposed in this paper in sorting algorithm called MinFinder to overcome some of the downsides and performs better compared to some conventional algorithms in terms of stability, computational time, complexity analysis.
