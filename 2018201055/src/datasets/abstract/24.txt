Graphs play an important role in many areas of Computer Science. In particular, our work is motivated by model-driven software development and by graph databases. For this reason, it is very important to have the means to express and to reason about the properties that a given graph may satisfy. With this aim, in this paper we present a visual logic that allows us to describe graph properties, including navigational properties, i.e., properties about the paths in a graph. The logic is equipped with a deductive tableau method that we have proved to be sound and complete.
