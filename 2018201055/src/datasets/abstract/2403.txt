This paper analyzes the factors that contribute or hinder the (joint) adoption of current research information systems (CRIS) and Open Access repositories (OAR) as manifestations of the Open Science principle. Given the significance attached to Open Science principles such as transparency and accessibility, we ask whether CRIS are able to reflect these priorities by providing technical interfaces or integrating OAR into the CRIS structure. We suggest that the interplay of national and institutional governance structures and policies is crucial for the adequate and efficient integration of CRIS and Open Science. To account for variances in both national and institutional context factors, we compare research institutions in three countries: Italy, the Netherlands and Germany. The qualitative exploratory analysis suggests that the consistent adoption and implementation of CRIS and Open Access policies in a science system are facilitated by national evaluation or quality assessment policies. In addition, the integration of Open Access repositories into CRIS is furthered by an institutionalized, efficient and flexible CRIS infrastructure.
