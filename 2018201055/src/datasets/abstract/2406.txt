Algorithm Visualisation (AV) tool is commonly used to learn data structures. However, since that tool does not address technical details, some students may not know how to implement the data structures. This paper integrates the AV tool with Program Visualisation (PV) tool to help the students understanding the data structuresâ€™ implementation. The integration (which is implemented as a tool named DS-PITON) works similarly as a PV tool except that the data structures are visualised with the AV tool. Through quasi experiments, it can be stated that DS-PITON helps students to get better assessment score and to complete their assessment faster (even though the impact on completion time can work in reverse on slow-paced students). Further, according to a questionnaire survey, the students believe that DS-PITON helps them learning data structure materials.
