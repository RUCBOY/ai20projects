In this paper was proposed the simple concept and realization of the technical system, for physical objects spatial location detection, with optimization methods for low quality hardware. This computer system consists of computers, software applications, video cameras, computer network, active and passive network equipment. The basic idea of the system is the principle of triangulation by the visual images and time data from at least 4 cameras with high number of frames per second. The system then creates photorealistic graphical 3D animation of object trajectory and space, using the calculated spatial location data. Experimental results and a computer simulation of a real system indicated that the proposed concept improves objects spatial location detection and 3D graphics on medium quality technical equipment.
