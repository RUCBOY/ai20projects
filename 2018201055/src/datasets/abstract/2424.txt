This research has provided the most active 5-HT6R agents among 1,3,5-triazine derivatives investigated to date and has also identified the world's first selenium-containing 5-HT6R ligands. The studies are focused on design, synthesis, biological evaluation and docking-supported SAR analysis for novel 5-HT6R agents as derivatives of lead structure 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-6-(phenoxymethyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (7). The lead modifications included an introduction of: (i) various small substituents at benzene ring, (ii) a branched ether linker or (iii) the ether oxygen replacement with other chalcogen (S, Se) or sulfonyl moiety. Hence, a series of new compounds (7–24) was synthesized and examined on their affinities for 5-HT6R and selectivity, in respect to the 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR, 5-HT7R and dopamine D2 receptor, in the radioligand binding assays. For representative most active compounds functional bioassays and toxicity profile in vitro and antidepressant-like activity in vivo were examined. The 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenyl derivative (10) was found as the most active triazine 5-HT6R antagonist (Ki = 11 nM). SAR analysis indicated, that an exchange of oxygen to selenium (7 vs. 22), and especially, to sulfur (7 vs. 19) was beneficial to increase both affinity and antagonistic action for 5-HT6R. Surprisingly, an introduction of SO2 caused a drastic decrease of the 5-HT6R affinity, which was explained at a molecular level based on docking studies. All in vivo tested compounds (10, 18 and 21) did not show any risk of toxicity in the safety studies in vitro.
