The open science movement is promising to revolutionise the way science is conducted with the goal to make it more fair, solid and democratic. This revolution is destined to remain just a wish if it is not supported by changes in culture and practices as well as in enabling technologies. This paper describes the D4Science offerings to enact open science-friendly Virtual Research Environments. In particular, the paper describes how complete solutions suitable for realising open science practices can be achieved by integrating a social networking collaborative environment with a shared workspace, an open data analytics platform, and a catalogue enabling to effectively find, access and reuse every research artefact.
