Migration consequence what were caused by the economic crisis and easy opportunity to travel and work abroad will be felt in society for a long time. Latvia has lost a lot of people in working age and those who could improve demographic situation. They now live abroad, have their own company and establish families. All this is necessary for Latvia now, therefore would be useful to involve diaspora in business environment and innovation development.
The aim of the research outlined in this article is by performing deeper analysis of diaspora’s survey of possible involvement of Latvian diaspora’s into entrepreneurship and innovation development in Latvia, by developing model for facilitation of cooperation between higher education institutions (HEIs) and science, governmental institutions, business representatives and society. Model is based on results of survey performed with Latvian diasporas in the world. Model is showing possible types of cooperation and help expected from Latvia’s institution’s side to improve level of diaspora representative’s involvement in economy, politics and everyday decisions in Latvia. Model is elaborated by using STELLA. This article is part of and supported by the state supported research project EKOSOC-LV, part 5.2.2.
