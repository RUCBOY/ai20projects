This study aimed to investigate the effects of blended learning on ninth grade students' achievement in science and their attitudes towards using it. It compares the results of various ways of teaching science topics, and students' attitudes towards their use. The study was conducted using a quasi-experimental design case study. The participants of the study were 112 students, divided into two groups: one an experimental group (n = 61) and the other a control group (n = 51). An achievement test and questionnaire were designed to confirm the study's validity and reliability. SPSS was used to analyze the data. The findings revealed that there were statistically significant differences between the experimental and the control groups, in favor of the experimental group, and the experimental group's attitudes were also more positive towards the using of blended learning. Their attitudes were in favor of students with academic performance in a science subject of the Performance level (Pass). The study recommends further research into the use of blended learning in higher education institutions.
