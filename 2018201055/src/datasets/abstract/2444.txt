Research topic studies have gained popularity in many disciplines, including library and information science (LIS). However, the lack of representation of library science and librarianship in literature indicates a research bias due to the preset methodology parameters, which are commonly based on impact factor scores in the Journal Citation Report of Thomson Reuters. In research, the authors utilize an improved selection criterion of journals and author-supplied keyword clustering and analysis technique to study the most recent ten years of LIS journal publications. This article presents a clear picture of popular research topics in seminal literature to help practicing librarians and library science scholars gain a better understanding and considerable prediction on the research trends in the LIS field.
