In order to measure environmental parameters in a better way, we use WiFi technology and design a new environmental monitoring system. This system uses humiture sensor and optical sensor to collect humiture and optical data, through wireless communication module in communication with the host computer. It accepts the collection instruction and sends real-time data to the host computer. This paper shows the structure diagram of system, the circuit diagram of control node and sensor node, the flow chart of programming and the user interface of PC. Generally, this system is easily-operated, rapid, and functional thus has the potential to be widely applicated.
