Appearance-based object recognition can be used in various applications such as human-computer interface and information retrieval. Therefore, many researchers compete with others to present their best in object recognition. Since object recognition has been studied for a long time and encompassed diverse approaches, therefore a review of the latest works is needed. This paper aims to deliver the trends in object recognition researches focusing on instance recognition and foreground detection such as salient object detection and object detection as supporting methods. Covering 34 publications, we survey the approaches, methods, datasets, performance measure, and experimental results. We also present research challenges in object recognition which can be used as suggestions for future works. We hope that our work can provide an overview of the current trends for object recognition and foreground detection methods.
