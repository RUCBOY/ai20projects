With the increasing use of the internet and dependence on the internet itself, resulting in more and more systems being developed to make the devices, such as computers/laptops, smartphones/tablets, and other devices can be integrated with each other. Internet of Things, is one of the concepts of technology that seeks the integration between these devices. IoT can be used in many fields, for example for smart cities, industrial, medical, and one of the biggest is its use in the home. One example of implementing IoT on smart home is its application to control household appliances, such as air conditioners, light, TVs, and others. From the results of further research, a smart socket with mobile application was developed that can help people to be able to control electronical devices at home. Smart socket designed using Arduino microcontroller. The system created allows users to control the devices for each socket, doesnâ€™t control for one power strip. With this system, it can reduce exccessive use of electricity as a result forgot to shut down.
