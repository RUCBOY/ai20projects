The Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI), opened in August 2016, provides free resources, services, experts, and ideas for creating and sustaining science gateways. It offers five areas of services to the science gateway developer and user communities: the Incubator, Extended Developer Support, the Scientific Software Collaborative, Community Engagement and Exchange, and Workforce Development. While all these areas are available to US-based communities, the Incubator, the Scientific Software Collaborative and the Community Engagement and Exchange also serve international communities. We aim to reach out and support gateways on an international scale by forming and deepening collaborations with partner organizations and coalitions beneficial and/or related to the science gateways community. Research topics are independent of national borders and researchers spread worldwide can benefit from each other’s research results, software, data and from lessons learned — via online materials and publications or at international events. The gateway community has long benefited from this type of exchange. This paper will present related work describing the benefits of international collaborations generally, and specifically as they relate to science gateways. We go into detail regarding SGCI’s ongoing work on an international scale and its work planned in the near future.
