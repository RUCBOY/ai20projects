Security warning is a form of message that is designed to imitate authorized security alerting function to notify, warn and advice user about the consequence of an action by allowing random applications to run on the computer system. On the other hand, regular computer users tend to ignore the security warning that conveys excessive technical messages which are difficult for them to understand and lead to lack of motivation for decision making. Consequently, an online survey has been utilized by a group of 250 participants to gain general insights based on the user’s understanding of security warning. This paper describes one main finding utilizing the Chi-Square test. From the finding, it can be suggested that 2 hypotheses were statistically significant in terms of user’s understanding and their assessments towards computer security warning. On the other hand, variable of gender indicates with the highest significant values with three statistically significant 0.004, 0.017 and 0.000 respectively The overall results from the test given indicate that for each variable were connected between computer user’s skills and their understanding in order to improve security warning in the future.
