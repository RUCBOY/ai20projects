Graph kernels are applied heavily for the classification of structured data. In this paper, we propose a deep Rényi entropy graph kernel for this purpose. We gauge the deep information through a family of h-layer expansion subgraphs rooted at a vertex, and define a h-layer depth-based second-order Rényi entropy representation for each vertex. The second-order Rényi entropy representation is used together with Euclidean distance to build a deep second-order Rényi entropy graph kernel (SREGK). For graphs with n vertices, the time complexity for our kernel is O(n3). This low-order polynomial complexity enables our subgraph kernels to easily scale up to graphs of reasonably large sizes and thus overcome the size limits arising in state-of-the-art graph kernels. Experimental results on fourteen real world graph datasets are shown to demonstrate the overall superior performance of our approach over a number of state-of-the-art methods.
