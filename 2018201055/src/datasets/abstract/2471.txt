The aim of this study was to obtain soft tissue thickness (STTs) of Caucasian males starting from 12 bone landmarks, to allow facial reconstruction and assign an identity to skeletal remains. When a skeleton is found without any circumstantial evidence of identity, through anthropological investigations it is possible to estimate age, sex, and race studying specific characteristics of bones. This first step of identification process helps investigators to narrow down the identity suppositions, but not always forensic analysis guarantees a final positive identification. Moreover, it is possible to rely on facial reconstruction trying to reproduce the likely features of the face from the skull. The obtained images could be used as a support in recognition by relatives who could provide photos and other data to carry out a comparative analysis. Furthermore, identity can be confirmed by conventional identification methods such as DNA profiling, odontological identification, and radiological comparison.
Forensic facial reconstruction (FFR) is based on the bone surface that conditions the facial physiognomy. Analyzing cone beam CT (CBCT) scans of 30 Caucasian males, average STTs values were obtained. CBCT, compared with the conventional spiral CT, has much lower radiation doses, lower costs, high spatial resolution and focuses on head and neck. The obtained results were compared with existing literature and databases and were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Two researchers repeated measurements in different times to assess the reliability of the method.
