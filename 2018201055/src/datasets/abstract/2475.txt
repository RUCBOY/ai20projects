In this paper, we study the identification problem of human limbs synergistic interaction based on the application of natural human-computer interaction. We proposed an identification model of human limbs cooperative interaction based on the Random Increased Hybrid Learning Machine for the unique requirements of natural human-computer interaction applications. The model combines the motion region image, the Hu invariant moment model and the RIHLM. In this paper, the algorithm theory, the model rationality and the implementation of the human motion recognition model based on the RIHLM is described. Finally, by comparing the experimental results, we verified that the model presented in this paper has better robustness, timeliness and accuracy in the application of natural human-computer interaction.
