Computer vision is a rapidly developing field of human knowledge. Due to the fullness of images information visual sensors, unlike other types of sensors, theoretically can cover the entire amount of information necessary for autonomous driving, registration of traffic violations, in various medical tasks and so on. The requirements for computer vision specialists are growing every day. At the same time, it is advisable to train specialists in related fields the basics of computer vision. This paper provides an overview of the main points that should be taken into account during the education process in the field of object detection and tracking using computer vision algorithms.
