The paper describes the application of local binary patterns and cascade AdaBoost classifier (CAC) to detect and analyse mice behavioural movement. This was done with a view to investigating the inconsistencies associated with current practices, whereby mice behavioural classification is achieved by means of human-generated labels. The developed cascade AdaBoost algorithm was able to detect eight different mice movement, and we develop a system that allows mice behavioural analysis in videos, with minimal supervision. Evaluating the results on Completeness, Consistency and Correctness, and based on the devised analysis, a solution was deployed, showing that machine learning plays an important role in translating video data into scientific knowledge. This is a useful addition to the animal behaviouristâ€™s analytical toolkit.
