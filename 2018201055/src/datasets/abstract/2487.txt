The structure and energy distribution of novel beam have attracted wide attention because of many potential applications. In this article, the adjustable ‘multiple antennae round shield’ beam was generated by computer-generated hologram multiplying the phase of gauss beam and Lorentz-Gauss beam with a reflection-type phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM). Contrast to those generated by amplitude spatial modulation, our experimental results were generated with high-energy efficiency for use of phase-only SLM. In addition, many novel focal patterns occurred with tunable intensity distribution. The positive correlations were investigated in number of spot extensions of ‘multiple antennae round shield’ beam and charge number m, which induces quantities of paramount applications such as atomic magnetometer and optical tweezers.
