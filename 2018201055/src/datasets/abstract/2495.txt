Multimodal medical image fusion has played an important role to diagnose the diseases for clinical treatment analysis and improving the performance and precision of the computer assisted system. In a recent development of medical filed single multimodal medical image cannot provide all the details of human body. For example, the soft tissue information can be represented by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography imaging represent the bones dense structure with less distortion. In this paper, proposed the combination of NSCT with DTCWT hybrid fusion algorithm. The hybrid fusion algorithm is verified through a simulation experiment on different multimodality images. Experimental results are evaluated by the number of well-known performance evaluation metrics.
