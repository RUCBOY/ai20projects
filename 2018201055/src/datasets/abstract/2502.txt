Practical work is a crucial step in the learning process, especially for science courses. Today, universities face a difficult situation when it comes to integrating students into the application of the course’s notions. The high number of learners requires an important logistical investigation. As a result, the arrival of remote laboratories or virtual laboratories helps to improve this situation. In this paper, we propose an approach for Electronic laboratory (E-lab) that allows instructors and learners to configure and simulate their projects related to computer networks. The approach is in the form of a web application dedicated to the project’s stakeholders.
