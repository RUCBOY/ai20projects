Emerging interdisciplinary data-intensive science gateway applications in engineering fields (e.g., bioinformatics, cybermanufacturing) demand the use of high-performance computing resources. However, to mitigate operational costs and management efforts for these science gateway applications, there is a need to effectively deploy them on federated heterogeneous resources managed by external Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). In this paper, we present a novel methodology to deliver fast, automatic and flexible resource provisioning services for such application-owners with limited expertise in composing and deploying suitable cloud architectures. Our methodology features a Component Abstraction Model to implement intelligent resource ‘abstractions’ coupled with ‘reusable’ hardware and software configuration in the form of “custom templates” to simplify heterogeneous resource management efforts. It also features a novel middleware that provides services via a set of recommendation schemes for a context-aware requirement-collection questionnaire. Recommendations match the requirements to available resources and thus assist novice and expert users to make relevant configuration selections with CSP collaboration. To evaluate our middleware, we study the impact of user preferences in requirement collection, jobs execution and resource adaptation for a real-world manufacturing application on Amazon Web Services and the GENI cloud platforms. Our experiment results show that our scheme improves the resource recommendation accuracy in the manufacturing science gateway application by up to 21% compared to the existing schemes. We also show the impact of custom templates knowledgebase maturity at the CSP side for handling novice and expert user preferences in terms of the resource recommendation accuracy.
