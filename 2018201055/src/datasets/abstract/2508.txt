Nowadays with rapid advancement in computer vision technology, 3D eyeball tracking, and its movement is the most focus on interest in researchers due to its simplification and vastly used in authentication by iris, handling screen by gaze and control in gaming world applications. It is quite challenging to capture the activity of eyeball with the highest functionality and additionally hardware becomes the source of increasing the overhead of cost. We have proposed the 3D eyed model to extract the internal features of eye i.e. pupil, eyelids and eye corners for notifying the position of the 3D eyeball. Based on the proposed 3D eye model, a 3D pupil is estimated the main feature embedded as a reference to identify points in locating eyeball position. The proposed system will track four movements of 3D eyeball i.e. up, right, left and straight. It is working in real time by acquiring snapshot from a webcam from the real world and is implemented to scroll page by eye movements. Setting up the system is easier than compared to the IR illumination method that provided an accurate result of low cost and more user satisfaction.
