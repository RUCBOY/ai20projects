Many individuals experience eye discomfort and vision problems when viewing digital screens for extended periods leading to Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS). The solutions to digital screen- related vision problems are by insisting suitable preventive actions by obtaining regular eye care. The proposed work uses Viola Jones algorithm for detecting the eyes, eye blink using background subtraction, gradient based corner detection and it is capable of detecting common cases of fatigued behaviour linked with prolonged computer use by tracking the eye blink rate. Hence, this proposed system could significantly reduce the symptoms among regular computer users leading to improved health habits.
