In the process of engineering applications, we often use a large number of vertices and edges to represent the complex system model, but sometimes the model is so complex that it is impossible to draw the graph neatly and beautifully by hand. So how to draw the graph automatically using the computer and how to make the graph visual become an important research topic. Based on the study on the genetic algorithm, SHLA algorithm and FR algorithm, we implement these algorithms by analyzing the pseudo-codes. Especially we focus on the study of the source programming about FR-boost and then implement an improved FR algorithm that selects XML document as the input and output graph files. It can effectively reduce the complexity of algorithm and increase the point-line graphâ€™s visualization.
