As our world of digital devices continues to expand, the amount of digital evidence encountered by law enforcement during case investigation is ever increasing. Faced with a preponderance of high capacity digital media devices, forensic investigators must be able to review them quickly, and establish which devices merit further attention. Utilizing a small single-board computer called Raspberry Pi, this mobile digital forensics triage device provides fast, targeted feedback for immediate evidence assessment.
A digital forensic device is presented in this paper. It is named SEAKER (Storage Evaluator and Knowledge Extraction Reader)[1] and it enables forensic investigators to perform triage on many digital devices very quickly. Developed for on-scene, time-sensitive investigations, its utility extends to preventing over-collection and large backlogs at digital forensics labs worldwide.
