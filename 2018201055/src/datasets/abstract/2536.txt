Game-Based Learning is widespread among elementary school students. Consequences in academic achievement motivation have been studied frequently. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of the Game-Based Learnings on the academic achievement motivation of the elementary school students. We used from a field method to collect the required data and complete the standard questionnaire. The study is a semi-experimental design with pretest-posttest design with the control group. The statistical population was 256,836 students of the first grade of elementary school students in the 2016-17 academic year. Sixty students (32 males and 28 females) were selected through a purposive method. Then, the subjects of the study were randomly allocated to the control and experimental groups, and a pre-test was performed from both groups. The experimental group was exposed to Misha and Kosha Game-Based Learnings, while we implemented the conventional teaching method to the control group. The measuring tool was the Inventory of School Motivation (ISM) questionnaire. The test has sufficient validity and reliability (α = 0.84). The covariance analysis test (MANCOVA) revealed that the experimental group had significantly higher scores for academic achievement motivation than the control group. Also, the results showed that the computer educational game impacted academic achievement motivation of elementary students. According to the results, the necessity of using computer-based games in elementary school students is felt. Therefore, it is necessary to find a more suitable place in the teachers' daily lesson plan. The results can be good for educators, instructional and game designers and researchers from implementation, design and research perspectives, respectively.
