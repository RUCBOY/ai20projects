Recently, the use of industrial robots as an alternative to computer numerical controlled (CNC) workbenches has been increasing due to the lack of access capabilities of CNC, their large masses and costs. Computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programs for industrial robot applications are still limited due to the following reasons. The trajectories in the CNC program are transformed into robot programs. Despite the wide-ranging capabilities of robots, the tooling orientation is not considered and the trajectory information is generated for commonly used blade geometries due to its suitability for CNCs. The robot configuration is not considered. When the industrial robots compared to CNCs, they have some disadvantages due to their articulated structure. They have difficulty in processing hard surfaces. In this study, a CAD program was developed for robotic milling to resolve the above-mentioned basic problems. Also, it can generate trajectories to increase the surface treatment quality. The program creates trajectory for IRBs from the graphic models in 3ds (3D Studio) format. The depth of the surface treatment can be controlled to increase the stiffness and reduce the geometric errors due to the robots are not rigid enough.
