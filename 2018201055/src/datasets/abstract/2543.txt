In this paper we pose a simple question: For firms that own or sponsor a computer or smartphone standard, is it better to make the standard open or closed? In other words, has openness paid as a business strategy? We explore the issue by examining the history of operating systems in computing and mobile phones, and rely on four different notions of openness: open systems, open innovation, open-source software, and open governance. We conclude that the truly successful operating systems have been those whose owner or sponsor has managed to combine some degree of openness with some measure of control.1
