The Internet of Things (IoT) continues its growth, adoption, toward ubiquitous usage but is not without the inevitable communication bandwidth challenge. Human-computer-interaction in this space must account for the multiple facets of human-in-the-loop considerations in IoT, yet current mechanisms are at present limited by display dimensions and unclear indicators. Mixed Reality (MR) may be a solution to this human communication bandwidth problem, as smart glasses and other head mounted displays could provide an ideal interface platform for IoT human-computer interaction, while handheld mobile MR can be used as a testbed. To bring MR interfaces to the IoT, this work contributes; i) a new IoT-Avatar architectural framework; ii) a bi-directional communication approach between an IoT system and a virtual avatar character representation; and iii) an early descriptive exploration of how such systems could be explored in future applications toward MR interfaces in ambient intelligent environments.
