With the advancement of computer and image-based technologies, imaging has come to be a pervasive medium by way of which we access, interpret and communicate information. Applying Knowledge Visualization framework principles to the study of a mineral at the unit cell level provides a fertile ground from which to extract significant representations. Using data collected from rigorous scientific analysis, the author extracted meaningful information from the crystalâ€™s geometry and physical properties to create new representations according to the Knowledge-Visualization methodology. The outcome was assessed in several interactive platforms and opened a new perspective on joint collaboration between Science, Humanities, and the Arts. Additionally, the experiment provided a new ground of investigation for unexpected connections between geometry, earth sciences, and local cultures.
