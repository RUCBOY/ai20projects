The concept of Green IT refers to sustainable technologies and information systems as well as environmentally friendly IT practices. Universities, which hold responsibility for propagating and applying knowledge, play an important role as disseminators of ideas related to Green IT. A framework that considers an environmental impact assessment to assist universities in the adoption of measures related to Green IT is proposed. The proposed framework consists of ten steps aligned with one another and with the goals of Green IT and highlights the possibility of using computer simulation to analyze environmental metrics. To exemplify the use of simulation, a case study was performed in the context of Green IT linked to sustainable universities. The environmental impact evaluation measured total consumption of electric energy, total energy cost and CO2 emission of three computer laboratories in a university. It was verified that the laboratory that obtained the largest CO2 emission was the Mining Engineering Laboratory in the second semester of 2018, totaling 0.0761 tCO2. By measuring the environmental metrics, it was possible to have an awareness of the quantitative environmental impact and to identify probable actions to continuously monitor and mitigate such impacts. Furthermore, by using computer simulation to compare base scenarios already programmed in a previous evaluation to newly generated scenarios, greater agility is afforded in the process of new evaluations.
