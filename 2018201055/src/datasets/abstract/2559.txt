Saliency detection is an important problem in computer vision and pattern recognition area. Many works have been proposed for addressing the saliency detection task. As a popular method, graph based saliency optimization has been widely studied. However, previous works have universally focussed on single graph optimization which fails to consider multi-view feature representation of image content. In this paper, we first provide a general framework for traditional graph based saliency optimization models. Then, we extend the general framework to the multi-view case and propose our general multi-view graph based saliency optimization model. Finally, we present a particular implementation of our general model and derive an effective updating algorithm to solve it. Experimental results using several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed saliency model.
