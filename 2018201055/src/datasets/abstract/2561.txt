In thinking about human-computer interface, it is important to know how human beings recognize, judge and act. Therefore, Card et al. devised a model of human cognitive processing process called Model Human Processor (MHP). However, this MHP predicts processing time from empirical rules, and is not much considered from the aspect of brain activity. In this study, we focused on readiness potential (RP), which is a characteristic brain wave, and verified MHP from the aspect of brain activity by measuring Electroencephalography (EEG) when performing basic user performance. Experimental results show that MHP can be roughly explained from the aspect of RP, which is a characteristic brain activity.
