The paper elaborates a successful attempt of adopting an Artificial Intelligence (AI) tactic Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) for Electroencephalographic (EEG) Data Classification. The objective was to implement an affordable Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) employing a consumer-grade EEG device. The role of the MAS classifier is significant in the context since the quality of data acquired through such a device is deficient. Several existing Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been evaluated using the same dataset, but none could defeat the performance of MAS. In fact, MAS could obtain 17% additional accuracy compared to the best model derived by a Support Vector Machine (SVM).
