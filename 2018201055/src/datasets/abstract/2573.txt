The development of computer technology has led to the development of face recognition technology. Nowadays, face recognition technology has been successfully applied in many fields with the help of computer technology and network technology. This paper establishes an effective face recognition model based on principal component analysis, genetic algorithm and support vector machine, in which principal component analysis is used to reduce feature dimension, genetic algorithm is used to optimize search strategy, and support vector machine is used to realize classification. Through the simulation experiment on the face database of the Institute of Technology of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2003, the results show that the model can achieve face recognition with high efficiency, and the highest accuracy rate is 99%.
