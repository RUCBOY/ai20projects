The synthesis of open-loop and closed-loop position and force control algorithms for a semiautomatic control system of a robot-manipulator has been performed. Computer models have been developed for a position-force control system with reconfigurable structure for a robot performing standard operations set by a human operator with a 3-degree-of-freedom handle. Animated computer simulation of dynamic processes in a system with different control algorithms has been performed and their precision characteristics have been evaluated. Some practical recommendations are given on the application of the achieved results for the development of training simulators for human supervisors of robot control systems.
