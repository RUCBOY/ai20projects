This article comprehends the design of a Brain-Based Robot (BBR) using hybrid techniques that incorporate both Brain-Based Device (BBD) and computational algorithms. BBDs are biologically inspired machines which have its behavior guided by a simulated nervous system. This nervous system follows detailed neuroanatomy of different brain areas. BBDs tend to have a nervous system with a large number of neurons and synapses. Thus, a huge computational power is required to simulate the nervous system of a BBD. Nevertheless, some of the tasks carried out by the simulated nervous system can be accomplished using computational algorithms which can help reducing the required computational power greatly. In this article, a BBR is built which combines some subsystems from BBD with computer vision algorithms. Computer vision algorithms are applied using OpenCV to extract some features from images, while neuronal-areas are connected together based on a detailed neuroanatomical structure to mimic the human learning process. Nengo python package is used for simulating neuronal areas in the system and monitoring activities of neuronal units. Moreover, the successful integration of the BBDâ€™s subsystems with computer vision leads to the perceptual categorization based on invariant object-recognition of various visual cues. To make a fair comparison with BBD, the nervous system of a BBD is built on the same computer used to build the hybrid brain for the proposed BBR. The proposed hybrid brain is then applied to a Nao humanoid robot in V-REP simulation environment to test it. The results obtained through this article prove that the proposed hybrid brain possesses the same intelligence of the BBD and requires much less computational power that it can run on an on-board computer of a robot, which makes it plausible for engineering applications.
