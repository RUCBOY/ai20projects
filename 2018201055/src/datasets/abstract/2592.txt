Brain–computer interface (BCI) is a combination of hardware and software that provides a non-muscular channel to send various messages and commands to the outside world and control external devices such as computers. BCI helps severely disabled patients having neuromuscular injuries, locked-in syndrome (LiS) to lead their life as a normal person to the best extent possible. There are various applications of BCI not only in the field of medicine but also in entertainment, lie detection, gaming, etc.
In this work, using BCI a Deceit Identification Test (DIT) is performed based on P300, which has a positive peak from 300 ms to 1000 ms of stimulus onset. The goal is to recognize and classify P300 signals with excellent results. The pre-processing has been performed using the band-pass filter to eliminate the artifacts.
Wavelet packet transform (WPT) is applied for feature extraction whereas linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is used as a classifier. Comparison with the other existing methods namely BCD, BAD, BPNN etc has been performed.
A novel experiment is conducted using EEG acquisition device for the collection of data set on 20 subjects, where 10 subjects acted as guilty and 10 subjects acted as innocent. Training and testing data are in the ratio of 90:10 and the accuracy obtained is up to 91.67%. The proposed approach that uses WPT and LDA results in high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
The method provided better results in comparison with the other existing methods. It is an efficient approach for deceit identification for EEG based BCI.
