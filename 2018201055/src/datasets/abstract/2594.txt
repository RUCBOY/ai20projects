More and more science and technology parks (STPs) are established in the world, but also the Czech Republic. Many benefits are attributed to them. One of them is also technology transfer support. This paper focuses on examining this feature of the STP using the case study of CERIT SP. This park was founded by Masaryk University in 2014 and brings together IT companies. Within the identified key areas, eight research questions have been identified. The first three questions focus on academic collaboration, supervision of bachelor's and master's theses, and engaging companies in teaching. Two more questions, dealing with technology cooperation, examine cooperation between firms and using the technical possibilities provided by the park and the faculty. Two questions related to events focus on the experience with park events as well as on the professional seminars that can effectively increase technology transfer. Both companies and park management expressed satisfaction with the status quo. In addition to evaluating how the STP can help technology transfer, the research also has a practical contribution. It provides feedback for management of the STP and inputs to manage it more efficiently.
