The aim of the article is to clarify the future division of labor between human and machine and its educational implications. Recent studies on future employment discuss whether growth in computer power and advances in artificial intelligence enable the automation of non-routine tasks, including tasks that require creativity and innovation, which are among the most unique human capacities. However, this discussion generally lacks research-based concepts of creativity and innovation. In order to clarify the discussion on the division of labor, relevant theories of creativity and innovation are introduced. The inquiry shows that creativity and innovation consist in making new connections between domains or practices. While computers and robotics are capable of operating only within specific domains, in which rules apply or data are available, creativity and innovation operate beyond the boundaries of such domains and must be guided by emotions and driven by moods. This suggests that computers and robotics make rapid change possible, but cannot solve the task of creating change themselves. The educational implications are that it is vital to cultivate the unique human capacities of sensing, understanding, handling and creating change, and to teach students and employees to collaborate with computers and robotics.
