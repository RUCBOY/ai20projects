Computer-based simulation is one of the most extensively used tools of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). This technique allows to simulate the operation of different kinds of facilities or processes in the real or hypothetical world using computers, making it possible to obtain key data about the system in different scenarios, without affecting the reality. Simulation tools allow develop robust models that are close to the studied reality, which does not happen with other decision-making support tools such as linear programming or some analytical solution methods such as calculus (differential and integral) and algebra, among others. The study develops a virtual platform for the simulation of industrial production systems with the objective of analyzing the operations of a small-scale distribution, especially aimed at students and professionals involved in the planning, design, and operation of logistic systems.
