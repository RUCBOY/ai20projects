Surgeons and gastroenterologists in training benefit from simulation-based endoscopy education, yet the price of most training endoscopy simulators is prohibitive. We set out to create and evaluate a low-cost endoscopic simulator and box model trainer for learning fundamental endoscopic skills.
After adding a wireless network-enabled camera (total cost, $20) to a discarded clinical endoscope, we paired this with an easily constructed box trainer (cost $32) to generate an endoscopic simulator system (YazanoScope) for simulation training. Participants (general surgery interns, research fellows, and medical and college students) used the YazanoScope to train to mastery on 5 FES tasks. Outcomes included skill assessments on a computer simulator and trainees' perceptions comparing the physical model to the computer simulator.
Forty trainees participated. The median (range) training time was 110 (60-180) min. Only 10% of trainees were able to reach the cecum at baseline compared to 100% after training. The mean (SD) time was 253 (154) s at baseline (including completers and non-completers) and 249 (89) after training (P = 0.88). On a retention test 2 wk later, 21 of 22 (96%) completed the computer simulator assessment (endoscope tip reached the cecum). Mean time was 214 (67) s (P = 0.32 compared with immediate posttraining). All 40 trainees believed the YazanoScope provided better haptic feedback than the computer simulator.
Training with this inexpensive, portable endoscopic simulator (YazanoScope) was associated with increased procedure completion with no change in procedure time. All participants favored the haptic feedback of the $52 YazanoScope over a computer simulator.
