The capabilities of radiation technology center at the Institute of Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IPCE RAS) were enhanced for the experimental processing of polymer materials. Methods for increasing the range of available doses and dose rates, to meet the demands of experiments conducted at the institute are presented. The computer code “BEAM SCANNING” was used in modeling and in preparing the experiments.
