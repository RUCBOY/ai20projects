Science-education literature is replete with studies examining how students learn anatomy most effectively and efficiently. Some researchers have found that students learn best through hands-on learning, whereas other investigators have concluded students rate both computer and hands-on learning as effective and enjoyable. No study to date, however, has examined anatomical learning of preservice music education students on anatomical and physiological knowledge of the larynx. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the effectiveness of virtual versus laboratory dissection in learning anatomy of the laryngeal structure for preservice music educators in a vocal pedagogy course. University students (N = 26) were given a pretest on laryngeal physiology and anatomy. Thereafter, the first group (n = 13) attended five 1-hour sessions of laryngeal dissection in a cadaver lab. The second group (n = 13) attended five 1-hour sessions in a computer lab equipped with Physiology and Anatomy Revealed, version 3.0 (McGraw Hill, New York, NY), a computer software program designed to simulate the dissection experience. Two days after finishing the laboratory or virtual dissection experience, each group was given a posttest. Perceptions were also gathered through a short questionnaire following the posttest. Results indicated that student knowledge and perceptions varied widely. All participants showed improved scores from pre- to posttest measures; however, scores were not significantly different between groups. Results are discussed in terms of feasibility of such a learning mode and importance of dissection experiences in understanding human anatomy as well impact on future music educators’ teaching practice.
