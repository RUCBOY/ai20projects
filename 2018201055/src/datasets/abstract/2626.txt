The critical analysis of computer systems involves the notions of ergonomics, heuristic inspection has long been considered part of the evaluation phase or the design process of the computer system. This evaluation is based on ergonomic criteria and represents the major ergonomic dimensions according to which an interface can be evaluated or specified, and several investigations have been conducted on the comprehensibility and evolution of these evaluation criteria.
The aim of this work is to present an overview of the ergonomic inspection criteria approaches, and to apply the AHP multicriteria prioritization method, for the selection and prioritization of these criteria.
