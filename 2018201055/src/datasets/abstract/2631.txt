The recent development in information technology has huge opportunities to improve the architectural education in terms of methodologies, strategies and tools. Building construction courses taught in the College of Architecture and Design at Jordan University of Science and Technology mainly depend on the traditional_Teacherâ€“centered_method of teaching. This research suggests a virtual environment technology as a tool to develop new educational approach for these courses.
This study developed computer software for this purpose to deal with building construction using virtual reality technology (BC\VR software). This software is designed by the authors for research purpose and presents 4D model (3D model and time dimension) for certain building construction phases using VR technology to do immersive and non-immersive virtual reality experience for the users. This research aims at evaluating the (BC\VR Software) in architectural education of building construction courses as a case study at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST) in terms of three axes: providing students with the building construction information, achieving enjoyment, and the integrating with other courses.
The study sample was selected from the population of building construction students at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST). A structured questionnaire was designed and distributed to the students of the abovementioned classes.
The results show that the VR software has the ability to achieve the three axes better than those of the traditional teaching method. As a conclusion, using the BC\VR software as a tool in building construction courses is very useful and effective for the students. The VR technology is also applicable on other architectural courses.
