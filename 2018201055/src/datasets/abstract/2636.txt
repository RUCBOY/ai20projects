In this paper, we describe parallel domain decomposition methods based on the restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) method for a quantum-corrected driftâ€“diffusion (QCDD) model for MOSFET devices. We have developed hybrid Message Passing Interface (MPI)/OpenMP parallelization algorithms of the QCDD system. For internode parallelization, two extensions of the RAS method are newly developed for the QCDD model. For intranode parallelization, we combine the conjugate gradient (CG) and BiCGSTAB procedures with a splitting-up operator method to realize parallelization of the incomplete factorization. The parallel numerical results for a three-dimensional Si bulk n-MOSFET on a multi-core NEC SX-ACE parallel computer are demonstrated. The intranode parallel numerical results are further evaluated on a many-core Cray XC40 parallel computer.
