Automated goal score detection in a football match is a comprehensive work and a challenging task as well. In this paper, we proposed a methodology for goal score detection using key moments of the match. Key moments in any sports are referred as actions that stimulate excitement or attraction of the audience. So, key moments can be identified using computer vision. Extracting one key moment involves many steps to happen at a time and it is necessary to integrate all the steps to identify it as a key moment. It is necessary to identify the goalpost region and track the ball to calculate the goal in football match. The proposed work analyses the various tracking algorithms and finalize MIL (Multiple Instance Learning) tracker technique to track the ball. So, the proposed work identifies the goal post region using sequence of image processing operations, tracks the ball using multiple instance learning tracker and confirms whether the goal has been occurred or not. The results of the proposed work have been shown.
