Background Crossing-based target selection motion may attain less error rates and higher interactive speed in some cases. Most of the research in target selection fields are focused on the analysis of the interaction results. Additionally, as trajectories play a much more important role in crossing-based target selection compared to the other interactive techniques, an ideal model for trajectories can help computer designers make predictions about interaction results during the process of target selection rather than at the end of the whole process. Methods In this paper, a trajectory prediction model for crossing-based target selection tasks is proposed by taking the reference of a dynamic model theory. Results Simulation results demonstrate that our model performed well with regard to the prediction of trajectories, endpoints and hitting time for target-selection motion, and the average error of trajectories, endpoints and hitting time values were found to be 17.28%, 2.73mm and 11.50%, respectively.
