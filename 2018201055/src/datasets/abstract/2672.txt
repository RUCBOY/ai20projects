Rapid ICT development, globalization challenges, intellectual property (IP) as indicators of economic development, and the challenge are the patentability of computer-implemented inventions and artificial intelligence implications for the IP Office (IPO) to transform from the digital paradigm to the smart paradigm. Nevertheless, because of the lack of literature on the smart IPO framework, we refer to smart government and smart city framework. The aim of this paper is to propose a framework for smart IPO in developing countries in the context of smart city framework. The study found that smart IPO composed of several components such as 1) Smart IPO Model; 2) Smart IPO Enterprise Architecture; 3) Smart IPO Collaboration Model; 4) Smart IPO Development Model; 5) Smart IPO Measurement Model; 6) Smart IPO Standard; and 7) Smart IPO Services. It also found that there are four models of IP office as follows: Model 1 (basic web-based, public services); Model 2 (advanced internal administration); Model 3 (full process automation); and Model 4 (knowledge-based IP services). Moreover, we found also three stages of IP development model: Stage 1 (automation of internal processes); Stage 2 (web-based e-services); Stage 3 (e-dossier, e-filing, e-payment).
