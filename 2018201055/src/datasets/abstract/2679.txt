Lately, numerous works have characterized the effectiveness of games in the process of learning. Benefits such as pleasure, stimulation, creativity, and enthusiasm have captivated people’s interest in science through interactive games. Hence, many games for teaching subjects in biochemistry have been developed. However, understanding molecular interactions in proteins can still be a difficult task for students in biochemistry classes. One of the main issues reported by them is the fact they cannot visually see an interaction that happens between proteins. More specifically, the atomic structure, the particulate nature of matter, the molecule, and the chemical interactions are considered abstract concepts by teachers and students. In this paper, we present the conception, development, and evaluation of Proteingo: a game created to build a crowdsourced database of protein-protein interactions. An experiment was conducted during the X-meeting 2016 Congress in Brazil, where 27 users played the Proteingo game. The development of the players along the plays, together with the answers of a post-test questionnaire, give substantial evidence of user’s incidental learning of chemical interactions through the Proteingo game. Also, 96.3% of the players consider the use of the game in classrooms as a didactic-pedagogical resource. Proteingo is available at http://bioinfo.dcc.ufmg.br/proteingo/.
