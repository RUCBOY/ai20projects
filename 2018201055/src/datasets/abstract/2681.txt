A model of upper and lower bounds of weak manipulability of 13 known aggregation procedures, based on majority relation, is proposed. The modified Nitzan-Kelly index is used to evaluate the spread of the degree of manipulability for Kelly’s, Gardenfors, and Expected utility weak extensions of agent’s preferences over the sets of alternatives. The results are obtained via computer simulations.
