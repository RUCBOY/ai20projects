Providing medical students with effective study strategies is paramount in fostering their success on the NBME Clinical Science Surgery exam. As of yet, there has not been a comprehensive inquiry into a study strategy for this exam. We aim to identify if the following are associated with higher NBME raw exam scores: (1) the use of popular study materials, (2) the number of study materials used, and (3) the amount of time spent studying throughout the clerkship.
Over the period of 1 academic year, third-year medical students at our institution were administered a survey during their surgical clerkship inquiring about study materials used and hours spent studying per week. The data were then matched to studentsâ€™ raw NBME scores and then depersonalized. A total of 82 of 193 (42%) students responded with an overall average raw score of 76.74 on the NBME Clinical Science Surgery exam. By comparing our data to the NBME national average of 70 with a standard deviation of 8, a z test was used to compare the population mean to our sample means.
When investigating resources used, the combination of using an online question bank and a high yield review book yielded a high z score (6.23) and using 4 resources yielded the highest z score (6.28). Regarding study hours, the highest z scores were seen when students studied for 6 to 10 hours per week during the first half of the clerkship, and 11 to 15 hours per week during the second half of the clerkship (5.76 and 6.02, respectively).
In conclusion, higher NBME Clinical Science Surgery exam scores were correlated with the use of multiple and varied types of resources and increasing study time closer to the exam date. The resources and methods utilized by students achieving the highest exam scores can be recommended by surgical educators and employed by other medical students to foster academic success.
