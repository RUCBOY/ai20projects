This qualitative cross-case study explores three US preservice secondary science teachers' conceptions of their science teacher identities and contexts within which they draw upon those science identities for teaching. Grounded in a figured worlds framework, data analysis revealed that participants view their science teacher identity separate from their science identity, with only the latter being part of their “core” identity. Participants view their teacher identity as dominant, and draw upon their science identity's cultural tools in only two teaching contexts—teaching science content and analyzing student work to facilitate learning. Implications for teacher preparation programs are considered.
