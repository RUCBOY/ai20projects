Barramundi (Lates calcarifer) is a tropical finfish species rapidly growing in popularity for aquaculture production. However, sperm quality tests have yet to be adapted to enable selection of highly fertile male broodstock in this species. Accordingly, in this study advanced tools were optimized to evaluate barramundi sperm function to facilitate the future study of male fertility and address some of the reproductive constraints currently observed in captive-bred broodstock. Sperm morphology data were used to calibrate and validate automated sperm counting and motility detection by computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA; AndroVision, Minitube). Several parameters were examined to determine the optimum settings for accurate CASA sperm counting and were compared to manual haemocytometer methods including: sample dilution (1:1000, r = 0.87), minimum number of fields (n = 4, CV = 7.5%), and the effect of motile vs. immotile spermatozoa on automated counting (no effect, r = 0.99, P < .001). Assays for cell viability and DNA damage were also validated for barramundi spermatozoa using 70 °C heat-treated controls and a 5-point intact:damaged dilution curve (r = 0.98, P < .001), and DNase-treated sperm controls, respectively. Data from these optimized assessments indicated high variation between individuals for each parameter assessed and the presence of high rates of DNA and membrane damage in sperm samples tested. Further research building upon this preliminary sperm quality data, is required to identify the cause of DNA and membrane damage in barramundi spermatozoa and understand any potential relationships with paternal performance in commercial spawns.
