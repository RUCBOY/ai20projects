Medical knowledge is constantly changing; this puts pressure on educators to adapt instructional strategies to their students' learning styles (LSs). Therefore, identifying the LSs of medical students could help teachers to develop teaching strategies to achieve better outcomes. The purpose of this study was to determine the LSs of health science university students, and to assess the relationship between LSs and student satisfaction with educational activities.
This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in the Colleges of Medicine and Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS) Jeddah. We used Kolb's LS and a modified Student Satisfaction Survey from Mott Community College, Michigan. All participants received self-administered questionnaires; LS and demographic data were used as predictor variables. Students' satisfaction levels were considered the outcome variable.
A total of 359 students were recruited (mean age 19.0 ± 1.4 years; 53.5% males). The most popular LS was Accommodator (29.2%), followed by Assimilator (27.9%) and Diverger (25.6%), while the Converger style (17.3%) was the least preferred LS. The satisfaction scores of the students showed that they were generally satisfied with a mean score of 64.4%. Males were found to have higher satisfaction across all variables than females (p = 0.002).
This study could not find a predominant LS or satisfaction difference across LSs among health science students. Thus, the current educational programmes in KSAU-HS meet students' LSs and satisfaction. Educators need to broaden their strategies for instruction, so as to build an effective learning environment.
