This paper explores the ways in which employing experiential learning in the high education in Automotive Engineering by using computer-based simulation. A set of student-center simulation-based laboratory activities has been developed with a pedagogical approach is presented on basis of Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory. The chosen topic to be educated is road vehicle dynamic performance with focused on use of automotive standards and real-world problem in automotive industry. The pedagogical approach presented in this study can represent as a reference point for discussions in experiential learning environment for road vehicle dynamics curriculum, considering the use of the Kolb’s theory as a model for development of teaching-learning process and computer-based simulations as a teaching tool. As part of pedagogical proposal, this study is also focused on development of real-world experience in simulation environment as a concrete experiment in topics related to automotive industries. This paper considers the implication of concrete experimentation, reflective observation, and abstract conceptualization in all developed laboratory sessions for topic in road vehicle dynamics. Finally, some recommendations are recommended in order to help future works.
