In this paper we present an application of the hedge algebras controller and a direct adaptive fuzzy-neural output-feedback controller (DAFNOC) and Hedge algebras (HA) in control of the orientation of underwater vehicles. The experiments simulated on computers are done to prove the effectiveness, the feasibility of the proposed algorithm of the neural controller under different actions such as the noise in the measuring devices, the influence of the flow to the motion of underwater vehicles
