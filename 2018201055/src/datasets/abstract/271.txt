Sequence labeling is a fundamental task in natural language processing and has been widely studied. Recently, RNN-based sequence labeling models have increasingly gained attentions. Despite superior performance achieved by learning the long short-term (i.e., successive) dependencies, the way of sequentially processing inputs might limit the ability to capture the non-continuous relations over tokens within a sentence. To tackle the problem, we focus on how to effectively model successive and discrete dependencies of each token for enhancing the sequence labeling performance. Specifically, we propose an innovative attention-based model (called position-aware self-attention, i.e., PSA) as well as a well-designed self-attentional context fusion layer within a neural network architecture, to explore the positional information of an input sequence for capturing the latent relations among tokens. Extensive experiments on three classical tasks in sequence labeling domain, i.e., Â part-of-speech (POS) tagging, named entity recognition (NER) and phrase chunking, demonstrate our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-arts without any external knowledge, in terms of various metrics.
