Line balancing is a crucial task for manufacturing companies in order to improve productivity and minimize production costs. Different analytical and heuristic/metaheuristic methods have been used for solving Assembly Line Balancing Problems (ALBP) for many years in manufacturing industries. Computer simulation is a new technique which has got interest by some researchers, since last few decades. Unlike the other techniques, computer simulation enables one to manage the stochastic nature of system variables. However, literature reviews revealed that only few system variables have been taken into consideration in research works that have been conducted so far. This paper aims at extending the studies on application of computer simulation technique for line balancing in apparel industries. A garment style (ladies’ tunic) which has 54 operations was observed for experimentation. Sixty two operators are involved in existing production system. ARENA® simulation software was used for system modelling and simulation purpose. Model validation is accomplished through hypothesis test including about eight different system variables. After model validation five different ‘what-if’ scenarios are evaluated for reconfiguration of the assembly line.
