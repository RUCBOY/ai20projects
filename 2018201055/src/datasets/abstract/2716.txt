The development of practical quantum computers that can be used to solve real-world problems is in full swing driven by the ambitious expectation that quantum supremacy will be able to outperform classical super-computers. Like with any emerging compute technology, it needs early adopters in the scientific computing community to identify problems of practical interest that are suitable as proof-of-concept applications and to revise existing solution strategies and develop new ones that exploit the capabilities of the novel compute hardware.
In this article we describe a conceptual framework for reducing the computational complexity of simulation-driven automated design optimization processes, which are nowadays widely used in computer-aided product development, by exploiting quantum supremacy. Our approach is based on the assumption that quantum computers will become part of hybrid high-performance computing platforms and can then be used as application-specific accelerator devices.
