In this contribution we consider modeling of an optical element with freeform surface. As an example, we synthesize a freeform component, which allows to generate a required image for any object on the basis of Snell’s law and the law of energy conservation. The optical design of the freeform component utilizes ray tracing between the object and image desсribed with complex light distribution patterns.
