In September 2017, a group of technofeminist researchers and scholars met for an online discussion about the pasts, presents, and futures of technofeminist work. Participants included Megan Adams, Kris Blair, Lanette Cadle, DÃ nielle Nicole DeVoss, Radhika Gajjala, Angela Haas, Gail Hawisher, Donna LeCourt, Lisa Nakamura, Jackie Rhodes, Cindy Selfe, Barbi Smyser-Fauble, and Pam Takayoshi. This multivocal piece presents that conversation and captures voices, moments, and themes related to how we came to technology and feminist work, how we participated in the building of the field of computers and writing, what sort of work we engaged related to developing and supporting publishing venues for computers and writing scholars, and what hopes we have for technofeminist scholarly work for the future.
