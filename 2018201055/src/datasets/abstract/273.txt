In this paper, a modified collaborative filtering (MCF) algorithm with improved performance is developed for recommendation systems with application in predicting baseline data of Friedreichâ€™s Ataxia (FRDA) patients. The proposed MCF algorithm combines the individual merits of both the user-based collaborative filtering (UBCF) method and the item-based collaborative filtering (IBCF) method, where both the positively and negatively correlated neighbors are taken into account. The weighting parameters are introduced to quantify the degrees of utilizations of the UBCF and IBCF methods in the rating prediction, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the weighting parameters in order to achieve an adequate tradeoff between the positively and negatively correlated neighbors in terms of predicting the rating values. To demonstrate the prediction performance of the proposed MCF algorithm, the developed MCF algorithm is employed to assist with the baseline data collection for the FRDA patients. The effectiveness of the proposed MCF algorithm is confirmed by extensive experiments and, furthermore, it is shown that our algorithm outperforms some conventional approaches.
