We propose a general framework for computer-assisted verification of the presence of symmetry breaking, period-tupling and touch-and-go bifurcations of symmetric periodic orbits for reversible maps. The framework is then adopted to Poincaré maps in reversible autonomous Hamiltonian systems.
In order to justify the applicability of the method, we study bifurcations of halo orbits in the Circular Restricted Three Body Problem. We give a computer-assisted proof of the existence of wide branches of halo orbits bifurcating from L1,2,3-Lyapunov families and for wide range of mass parameter. For two physically relevant mass parameters we prove, that halo orbits undergo multiple period doubling, quadrupling and third-order touch-and-go bifurcations.
