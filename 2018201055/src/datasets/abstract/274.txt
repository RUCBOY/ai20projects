In the last few years, several techniques and models are used for retrieving significant information from urban big data of smart cities. This research work aims at developing a data fusion-based traffic congestion control system in smart cities using a deep learning model.
A hybrid model based on the convolution neural network (CNN) and long short term memory (LSTM) architectures are used for region-based traffic flow predictions in smart cities. CNN is used for the classification of spatial data while LSTM for temporal data.
The experiments used the CityPulse Traffic and CityPulse Pollution datasets, and measured root mean square error (RMSE), time consumption and accuracy. A small RMSE value of 49 and highest accuracy of 92.3% compared to other baseline models depicts the applicability of the proposed model in the region-based traffic flow prediction problems in the smart cities.
