It is suggested to use the ensemble of deep neural networks to design an intellectual situation classifier that solves the problem of normal and abnormal situations detection and recognition in a continuous video stream of the security system. The testing of its work was made on the basis of modern hardware and software and computer vision methods, the result of which is the classification probabilities for each video fragment. A software module in Python was created for normal and abnormal situations detection and recognition.
