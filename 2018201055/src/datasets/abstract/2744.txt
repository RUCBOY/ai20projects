Big Data is a collection of different hardware and software technologies, which have heterogeneous infrastructure. Hadoop framework plays a leading role in storing and processing Big Data. It offers fast and cost-effective solution for Big Data and is used in different sectors like healthcare, insurance and social media. Hadoop is an open source framework based on a distributed computing model and is applied for processing and storing data on a cluster of commodity computers. Due to the flexibility of framework, some vulnerabilities arise. These vulnerabilities are threats to the data and lead to attacks. In this paper, different types of vulnerabilities are discussed and possible solutions are provided to reduce or eliminate these vulnerabilities. The experiment setup used to perform common attacks to understand the concept and implementation of a solution to avoid those attacks is presented. The results show the effect of attacks on the performance. According to results, there is need to protect data using defense-in-depth to security.
