This paper provides supportive evidence to the recent research on the task-based trends in the structural change of the US employment. Automation takes place either through neutral technical change at the task level, or deepening of computer capital subject to steep relative price declines. Quantifying these different sources of technological change with the task data, I show that the US labor market significantly becomes more interpersonal-service oriented, and to a lesser extent, less routine-intensive.
