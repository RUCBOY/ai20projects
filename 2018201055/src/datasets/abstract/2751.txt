The paper provides a rationale for the effectiveness of the technology of lubrication of the rail roll surface in the curve by the locomotive in the train. The rational values of the friction constant on the roll surface of the inner rail are presented based on the results of computer simulation and field tests. The effect of reducing the lateral impact on the track by reducing the constant of friction on the roll surface of the inner rail and the side surface of the outer rail head is justified.
