The present communication presents a noteworthy application pertaining to biomedical application related to the generation of 16 types of different laser beam which has been applying in various medical operations nowadays. The said laser beams have been created with the help of single photonic structure where photonic structure deals with the plasmonic-based photonic crystal fiber (PCF) with having 5 × 5 periodic air holes with a defect at the center.The principle of generation of surgical laser beams relies on both physics and mathematics of photonic crystal fiber in such way that physics deals with structure and configuration of proposed PCF including lattice spacing and diameter of air holes where mathematics manipulates with plane wave expansion method to find out the electric field distribution in the fiber. Finally, the outcomes of the works disclose that suitable configuration of plasmonic structurewith respect to green signal generates different type of laser beams which could be used for the biomedical application.
