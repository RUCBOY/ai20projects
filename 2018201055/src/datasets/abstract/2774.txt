In the present paper the phase-locked loop (PLL), an electric circuit widely used in telecommunications and computer architectures is considered. A new modification of the PLL with tangential phase detector characteristic and active proportionally-integrating (PI) filter is introduced. Hold-in, pull-in and lock-in ranges for given circuit are studied rigorously. It is shown that lock-in range of the new PLL model is infinite, compared to the finite lock-in range of the classical PLL.
