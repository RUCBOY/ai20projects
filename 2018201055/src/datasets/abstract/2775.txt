The paper presents an integration of the citation data produced by the CyrCitEc project with CRIS Socionet tools. Socionet provides collections of research papers’ metadata. CyrCitEc parses the citation data from research papers’ PDF, including in-text citations and citation contexts. Socionet utilizes the citation data to build computer-generated annotations for the in-text citations in full text PDFs. This integration allows making in-text citation as interactive elements and opens an opportunity to create a communication instrument between citing and cited authors.
