The spatial analyses by means of high-resolution computer tomographic examination methods offer a new extended possibility of examinations and illustrations of the microstructure, which are particularly of great interest for construction materials. Material distributions, porosities with spatial pore distribution and formation, fibre orientation and distribution, crack courses etc. can be represented three-dimensionally (3D) in the building material structure. Many questions that arise in materials science could only be answered by describing changes of the material surfaces, whether caused by mechanical or chemical exposure. The two-dimensional (2D) examination only allows an evaluation of a section of a sample, but whether the surface or section being examined is representative for the entire sample often cannot be determined. With high-resolution computed tomography (Âµ-CT), it is now possible to carry out three-dimensional observations of construction materials. The possibilities and the efficiency are presented in the results of different investigations at the University of Kassel, Germany. In this article, the procedure and its possibilities are examined on the basis of fibre analysis.
