Cross-view classification that means to classify samples from heterogeneous views is a significant yet challenging problem in computer vision. An effective solution to this problem is the multi-view subspace learning (MvSL), which intends to find a common subspace for multi-view data. Although great progress has been made, existing methods usually fail to find a suitable subspace when multi-view data lies on nonlinear manifolds, thus leading to performance deterioration. To circumvent this drawback, we propose Multi-view Common Component Discriminant Analysis (MvCCDA) to handle view discrepancy, discriminability and nonlinearity in a joint manner. Specifically, our MvCCDA incorporates supervised information and local geometric information into the common component extraction process to learn a discriminant common subspace and to discover the nonlinear structure embedded in multi-view data. Optimization and complexity analysis of MvCCDA are also presented for completeness. Our MvCCDA is competitive with the state-of-the-art MvSL based methods on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority.
