Ice constructions, such as icebergs and ice fields, are of great importance for studying as they influence strongly the seismic exploration of the Arctic region. The researchers often ought to use the bad conducting materials for decreasing the wave reflections from the ice constructions. The effectiveness of such inclusions has not been proved yet. This paper presents the results of computer modeling for the elastic waves spread in the geological media of the Arctic region. We analyze the influence of the plastic inclusion on the wave field and on the seismograms. The difference between the x-components and y-components of the velocities in models with the plastic inclusion turns to be insignificant in comparison with the models without any plastic inclusion.
