Security is a crucial factor in Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANET) where inaccessible environments cause assorted categories of security intimidations to provide the malicious-free network. Game theory plays a crucial part in scheming well-organized security methodologies in computer networks. In this work, an Infinitely-repeated game and cooperation approach is designed to detect malicious nodes and also to enhance energy-efficiency. The goal of an Infinitely-repeated game aims to ensure the defector or malicious node in the network has a short run gain and a long-run loss. The prime objective of the proposed scheme is to attack detection and defense, accuracy for preventing the packet drops. The proposed method is verified via simulation.
