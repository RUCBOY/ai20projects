There is a growing Financial Technology (Fintech) business model, such as Peer to Peer (P2P) Lending. P2P Lending allows individuals and businesses to borrow and lend money to each other. In its development, China has become the market with the most P2P lending platforms. However, there is a moral hazard that makes this business need to be monitored. This threat begins with verification of the borrowerâ€™s data that is not appropriate. Whereas in Indonesia Fintech P2P Lending has received special attention, because its regulations and policies have not matured yet. Besides, P2P Lending is considered as a new business to flourish. Consequently, it requires investigation on problems from the implementation of the P2P Lending. This study aims to identify problems in P2P Lending and present alternative technical and non-technical solutions to the problems. By implementing the Kitchenham Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach from the ACM, AIS, IEEE, SCOPUS, and Science Direct databases, this research finds a rich picture, creates a table of problem identification and alternative solutions.
