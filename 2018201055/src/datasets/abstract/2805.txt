The conditions (36) for existence of the solution in the decomposed constraints (35) in [2] are not necessary and sufficient. These conditions are only necessary conditions. Also, the authors in [2] claimed that the maximal elements of the system of bipolar max-min equality constraints or set D are either g+ or belong to the set G={Supi=1,...,mgi|(∀i)(gi∈Gi−)}. This expression is not correct. The set G is revised such that it contains the maximal elements of D.
