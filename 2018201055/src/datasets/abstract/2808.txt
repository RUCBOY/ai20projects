We propose a novel method to group individuals in daily life images based on their interactions. It is extremely useful to automatically understand the mutual relation between individuals appearing in images and to group them based on their interaction. However, this is an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we determine the interacting groups more precisely by considering not only the spatial information of individuals in an image but also the emotional correlation between individuals. This is in contrast to the existing methods of determining groups based on the distribution of individuals. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we created a new dataset with the images acquired in everyday life to address the issue of detecting interacting groups. The results of intensive comparison experiments with the existing grouping methods reveal that the proposed method exhibits superior performance in determining the interacting group.
