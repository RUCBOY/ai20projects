This paper describes the planning of a computer-aided design (CAD) laboratory for training chemical engineers in graphic expression. The CAD laboratory was organised into four projects following a project-based learning method. Flipped classroom and contextualised learning were used to motivate the students and promote meaningful learning. The laboratory mainly focused on engaging the students by replicating 2D and 3D plans of common industrial engineering equipment and piping and instrumentation diagrams of industrial facilities. Two surveys carried out before and after the course showed that the student’s perception of their graphic expression skills significantly increased. Gender differences were observed in self-perceived graphic expression skills, particularly in spatial vision. The results showed considerable overall satisfaction with the method, scoring a value of 4.1 ± 0.9 in the Likert scale (maximum 5). Most of the students obtained a score higher than 8 in the CAD laboratory, showing their acquisition of specific competences. The results encouraged us to apply this method to subsequent courses and to extend training in graphic expression to other subjects in the chemical engineering degree. The method followed here can easily be extrapolated to other engineering disciplines.
