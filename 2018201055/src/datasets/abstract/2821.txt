In this paper, we are considering the possibility of using eye tracking technology in the context of information security. We expect that this novel technique will have a very effective impact in this field. Eye tracking technology is widely used to investigate user behavior when working with a computer. This technology allows to obtain analysis in the form fixation point (location of a userâ€™s eye gaze), scan-path (gaze trajectory), heat maps (areas of interest), salient picture components. Eye tracking research has been widely used to improve the design and usability of web pages, as well as to explore an understanding how users are guided by them. Moreover, this technology is widely used in the protection of information.
