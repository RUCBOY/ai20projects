The primary issue in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based monitoring applications is the preservation of the sensing coverage under the harsh physical environment. WSN forms the monitoring infrastructure, where a large set of energy-constrained sensor nodes are deployed to collect the physical parameters of the environment. The sensor nodes communicate their data to the nearby edge server (ES) where data is processed locally before it is forwarded to the distant cloud platform. Most of WSNâ€™s existing routing algorithms aim to develop an energy-efficient data transmission route without recognizing the effect of harsh external environment, rendering it non-adaptive to environmental changes. In this paper, we have focused to develop an energy-efficient hierarchical data dissemination protocol for the sensor to ES communication. Along with energy optimization, the proposed protocol aims to preserve the network coverage and supports the dynamic changes in network topology like node failure, node addition, etc., due to harsh environmental interface. As the sensor nodes are required to operate autonomously, the proposed protocols are designed by considering only the local information of a sensor node. Simulation and experimental results show the efficiency of the proposed protocol over many state-of-the-art protocols with respect to several parameters such as energy consumption, lifetime of the network, coverage ratio, packet delivery ratio, latency, etc.
