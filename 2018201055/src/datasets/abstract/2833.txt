We are entering an era where everything is almost connected. According to Gartner, "we expect to see 20 billion internet-connected things by 2020". This evolution has engendered a colossal amount of data that traditional computer applications could no longer handle. We penetrate the epoch of smart applications: intelligent, contextual and proactive. On the other side, a trend that makes the hype is Gamification. It is now being applied to several domains especially those that targets human engagement, performance and sustainability. In this paper, through a systematic mapping study, we will present a breadth-first review of search papers that integrate gamification in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The main aim is to provide a historical and geographic classification of research that combines IoT with gamification, the most challenging areas, and the artifacts that come out.
