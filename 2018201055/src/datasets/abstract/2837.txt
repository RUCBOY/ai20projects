The paper examines designing of a heterogeneous telecommunication network model, suitable for demands of transportation industry. The considered network simulation model comprises different transfer environments of modern voice and data systems, channel-forming elements and interfaces largely used in road and rail transport. The proposed heterogeneous network was built upon the SDH network (on the STM-1 level) with SDH/PDH switching equipment, radio-modems for cellular mobile communication networks, digital VoIP phones, utilizing IP/Ethernet connections to local computer networks. Heterogeneous network reflects the possibilities of modern telecommunication technologies and is used for experimental researches as a simulation model for automatic, telemechanics and communication systems in railway transport.
