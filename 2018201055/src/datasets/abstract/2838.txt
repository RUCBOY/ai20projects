Early action detection aims to detect the action as soon as possible, and has a variety of applications. In the field of computer vision, the first learning formulation on early event detection, the max-margin early event detector(MMED), is investigated by Hoai and Torre [1, 2]. In this study, the purpose of the proposed approach is to reduce the large number of constraints generated in the MMED method. The basic idea is to remove the redundancy among every three consecutive constraints in the MMED method. The number of constraints is reduced from O(IL3) to O(IL2) where I is the number of training examples and L is the length of the example time series. Proof and the experimental results are provided to show the correctness and feasibility of the proposed approach.
