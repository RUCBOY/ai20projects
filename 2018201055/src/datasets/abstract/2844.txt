Experiential learning model for acquiring skills on CAD Systems interoperability, using the Social Networked-based Education model and the Learning Factory platform, is presented. The experiential learning leads students to acquire knowledge on CAD Systems interoperability through the principle of “Project-first, just-in-time principles”. The experiential learning is applied in Computer Aided Design/Computer Aided Process Planning (CAD/CAPP) and Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) curricular units, within the fourth year of Integrated Master on Industrial Engineering and Management course and along seven years in row. The experiential learning model developed and implemented proved that experiential learning provides capacity of teaching of new features and experience of Industry 4.0 environment while keeping the actual “curricula”.
