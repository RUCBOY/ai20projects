The article is dedicated to the reproduction of behavior of a class of protozoans (ciliates) using computer simulation and genetic optimization. Protozoans have minimal cognitive abilities and no neural system. The only basis of their control system is mRNA and protein systems inside the cell. Ciliates have primitive sensitive receptors which can percept information only from the closest environment. But, nevertheless, unicellular organisms use their cognitive capacities for obstacles avoiding. In this paper, ethology of ciliate Uronychia transfuga is reproduced using a simple GasNet neural network and genetic optimization. It is showed that neural network of only 7 neurons combined with simple learning model is enough to achieve robust and natural behavior.
