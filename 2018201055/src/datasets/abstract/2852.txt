Image-based rendering is important both in the field of computer graphics and computer vision, and it is also widely used in virtual reality technology. For more than two decades, people have done a lot of work on the research of image-based rendering, and these methods can be divided into two categories according to whether the geometric information of the scene is utilized. According to this classification, we introduce some classical methods and representative methods proposed in recent years. We also compare and analyze the basic principles, advantages and disadvantages of different methods. Finally, some suggestions are given for research directions on image-based rendering techniques in the future.
