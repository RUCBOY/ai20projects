Thrombin inhibitor and anti-Xa are now widely used in clinical practice. However, the difference between thrombin inhibitor and anti-Xa in prevention of thrombosis is still to be elucidated.
Computer simulator implementing the function of platelet, coagulation, fibrinolysis and blood flow was developed. The function of thrombin is defined as to activated platelet at the rate of 0.01 s−1 and to produce fibrin at the rate of 0.1 s−1 in control. The effect of thrombin inhibitor was settled to reduce the rate of platelet activation and fibrin generation changed from 10 to 100% as compared to the control. The local thrombin generation rate on activated platelet was settled as 1.0 s−1 as a control. The effect of anti-Xa was settled to reduce to thrombin generation rate on activated platelet from 10% to 100% as compared to the control. The sizes of thrombi formed at site of endothelial injury in the presence and absence of thrombin inhibitor and anti-Xa were compared.
The size of thrombi formed by 30-s perfusion of blood at site of endothelial injury reduced both in the presence of thrombin inhibitor and anti-Xa. There was significant positive relationship between thrombin inhibitor effect and the size of formed thrombi with R value of 0.96. (p < 0.0001) However, the sizes of thrombi were not influence by anti-Xa until it decreased 30% or less as compared to control. There was no significant relationship between anti-Xa effect and the size of formed thrombi. (R = 0.39, p = 0.09) Our results suggest the different dose-dependent effects of thrombin inhibitor and anti-Xa on thrombus formation at least in specific conditions. Computer simulation may help to predict quantitative antithrombotic effects of various antithrombotic agents.
