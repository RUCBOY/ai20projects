Visual tracking is a fundamental task in many computer vision applications and has been well studied in the last decades. In the field of visual tracking, there are many issues to consider which make the development of a robust tracking method very difficult, among these complications; the appearance change of the target, the fast motion, the background clutter, the camera motion, and scale variation. To override these problems, we develop an effective general framework for object tracking that addresses most of these issues. First the tracking problem is formulated in the form of a robust cost function which is a composition of the appearance and dynamic model, this formulation ensures the integration of the appearance of the object and also the majority of basic geometric transformations. Second the minimization is accomplished by the gradient descent optimization. We present experimental results made on different challenging sequences, the experimentations results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods.
