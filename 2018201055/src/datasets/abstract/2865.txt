This special issue introduces a series of papers that make available new methods to the phonetic and linguistic community and reflect upon existing data analysis practices. In our introduction, we highlight three themes that we consider pressing issues in data analysis and that run across the contributions to this special issue: the difference between exploratory and confirmatory analyses, different approaches to statistical inference, and the analysis of multidimensional multivariate speech data. Moreover, we provide a call for considering the importance of open and reproducible research practices, such as publishing oneâ€™s data and analysis code. Rather than being dogmatic about particular statistical methods, the pluralism of analysis approaches in linguistics should excite debate and discussion, to which this special issue is an invitation. In addition, the co-existence of multiple ways of analyzing the same data (each with its own advantages and disadvantages and different analysis goals) makes it all the more important for researchers to make their research process open and accessible to other researchers.
