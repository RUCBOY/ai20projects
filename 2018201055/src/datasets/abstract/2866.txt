Proficiency in English academic writing is critical to students' success at university. With recent advances in language technology, a computer-assisted language learning approach can potentially provide students with additional practice and feedback. We describe our effort in building a tool that promotes greater awareness of how students can expand their registerial repertoire by employing grammatical metaphor, in particular through feedback on the lexico-grammatical options in the nominalization of clauses. An empirical study shows that this tool can help university students produce grammatically appropriate nominalization. Finally, we present detailed analysis on studentsâ€™ common errors when attempting nominalization.
