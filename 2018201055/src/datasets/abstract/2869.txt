Augmented reality (AR) has the potential to offer a novel approach to CPR training that supplements conventional training methods with gamification and a more interactive learning experience. This is done through computer-generated imagery superimposed on users’ view of the real environment to simulate interactive training scenarios. We sought to test the feasibility of an AR CPR training system (CPReality) for health care providers (HCPs).
In this feasibility trial, a CPR training manikin was integrated with a commercial AR device (Microsoft HoloLens) to provide participants with real-time audio-visual feedback via a holographic overlay of blood flow to vital organs dependent on CC quality. In this system, higher quality CC visually improved virtual blood circulation. HCPs performed a 2-minute cycle of hands-only CPR using only the AR system, and CC parameters were recorded. Descriptive data on participants’ demographics, CC quality, and satisfaction with the training environment were reported using quantitative and qualitative analysis.
Between 10/2018–11/2018, we enrolled a convenience sample of 51 HCPs. The median age of participants was 31 years (IQR 27–41), 71% (36/51) were female, and 67% (34/51) were registered nurses. CC rates (mean 126 ± 12.9 cpm), depths (median 53 mm, IQR 46–58), and percent with complete recoil (median 80%, IQR 12–100) were consistent with guideline recommendations for good quality CPR. Participants were predominantly satisfied with the system, with 82% perceiving the experience as realistic, 98% recognizing the visualizations as helpful for training, and 94% willing to use the application in future CPR training.
As AR is increasingly applied in the healthcare setting, integration in CPR training offers a novel and promising educational approach. In this convenience sample of trained HCPs, high quality CC delivery was feasible using the AR CPR training system which was received favorably by most participants.
