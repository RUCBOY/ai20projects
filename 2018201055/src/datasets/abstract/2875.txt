With the emergence of communication technologies (CT), humans have become more connected than ever to their environment through various devices and computer platforms. These devices are integrated into everyday life, in an omnipresent way, such that people can interact effortlessly and intuitively. The goal is to improve their life by allowing them access to various services and information at any time and in any situation or place they are even in harsh environment. This intensive technological presence in an area is called smart or connected zones. Within these zones, technology is used to collect, process and share information in order to facilitate citizensâ€™ activities and assist authorities in decision-making and efficient service provision. This paper reviews principal requirements and challenges for CT to be used in such zone. First, we introduce its concept by highlighting its characteristics, features, devices and applications. Then we examine related works, communication requirements and challenges. We finish this paper by the conclusion.
