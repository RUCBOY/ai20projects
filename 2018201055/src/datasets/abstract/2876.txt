We report on our attempt to perform the three-dimensional (3D) visualization of dislocation clusters in multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) ingot by processing photoluminescence (PL) images and analysis of dislocation clusters in mc-Si. As-sliced wafers prepared using a high-performance (HP) mc-Si ingot were sequentially measured by PL imaging with intentional superposition of reflection. Then, various image processing techniques were applied to all the PL images to extract dark regions, which most likely correspond to dislocation clusters, as well as microstructures. By 3D reconstruction using a large quantity of 2D images, we could successfully visualize the generation, propagation and annihilation of dislocation clusters in HP mc-Si ingot. In addition, relationship between source region of dislocation clusters and crystal orientation were investigated by combining data scientific and experimental approaches. As a result, it was suggested that small angle grain boundaries with angular deviation of less than 10 degrees cause the generation of dislocation clusters.
