Technology acceptance is an emerging concept which has been researched over the decades. On basis of the prior researches which represented the relationship between the user anxiety and the exogenous variables of technology acceptance model, we conducted meta-analysis to obtain the effect size of the anxiety on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. So we used Comprehensive Meta Analysis software program and evaluated 46 articles’ correlation scores. Fixed and random effects statistical model were applied to the data. As a result, random effects model was found more relevant to represent the relationship between anxiety and the exogenous variables of technology acceptance model. Findings represented that the average effect size of perceived usefulness and anxiety was small (ṝ =-0.139, p=0.00), although the effect size of perceived ease of use and anxiety was found medium level (ṝ =-0.291, p=0.00) in this study.
