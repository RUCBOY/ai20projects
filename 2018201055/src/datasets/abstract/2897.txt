An analysis of the existing engineering solutions for a smart public transport system has been carried out. The main drawbacks of modern systems have been shown and the relevance of the development of the smart public transport system with the use of new approaches and up-to-date element base has been proved. The structure of the system based on client-server architecture and modular approach has been developed, which allows upgrading the system quickly.
The algorithms of the front-end and back-end of the system functioning have been constructed. The structured model of the smart public transport system based on Petri net has been developed and studied, which allows studying the dynamics of the system being designed in detail. The software and hardware of the front-end and back-end of the smart public transport system with the use of a single-board computer and other modern technical means have been developed.
