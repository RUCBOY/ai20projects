Safety Science was established in 1976 as the Journal of Occupational Accidents. Safety Science was established with the vision of promoting multidisciplinary research in the science and technology of human and industrial safety and serving as a guide for the safety of people at work and in other spheres, such as transportation, energy or infrastructure, as well as in every other field of hazardous human activities. To celebrate 40â€¯years of publishing outstanding research, this study intends to develop a bibliometric analysis of the publications of the journal between 1976 and 2016. The purpose is to identify the leading trends of the journal in terms of impact, topics, authors, universities and countries. This study uses the most reliable database, the Web of Science Core Collection. Moreover, the work analyses the mapping of bibliographic couplings, co-citations, citations, co-authorships and co-occurrences of keywords.
