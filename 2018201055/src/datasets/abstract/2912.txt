We present in principle and demonstrate experimentally the focal performance of a new azimuthally polarized Lorentz-Gaussian vortex beam rigorously from different dimensions. Based on vector diffraction theory, the expressions for the electric fields of this beam are derived. The effect of beam parameters on focal pattern evolution is explored. Based on the modulation of beam parameters, ideal beam shaping can be realized in azimuthally polarized Lorentz-Gaussian vortex beam. Additionally, we adopt phase-only spatial light modulator in Fourier space to exhibit desired beam with specific parameters through computer-generated hologram (CGH). According to the conclusions either in theory or experiment, more and more application points about vector beams would be excavated.
