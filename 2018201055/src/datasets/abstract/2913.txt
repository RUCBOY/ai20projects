We report, for the first time, the three dimensional reconstruction (3D) of a transistor from a microprocessor chip and roughness of molecular electronic junction obtained by electron tomography with Hole Free Phase Plate (HFPP) imaging. The HFPP appears to enhance contrast between inorganic materials and also increase the visibility of interfaces between different materials. We demonstrate that the degree of enhancement varies depending on material and thickness of the samples using experimental and simulation data.
