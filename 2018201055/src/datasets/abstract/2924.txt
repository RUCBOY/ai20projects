Residual stresses arising in the drawing process have a significant impact on the quality of the cold-drawn wire. Knowledge of residual stresses and their distribution makes it possible to predict the behavior of metal products under operating loads and to prevent their possible destruction. In this regard, it is necessary to adjust the main parameters of the drawing process, including the geometry of the die channel. The work is devoted to the study of residual stresses arising from inhomogeneity of plastic deformation depending on the reduction value and the die angle. Computer simulation of wire drawing process by finite element method is performed. The distributions of residual stress tensor components along the wire radius are calculated for different values of reduction and die angle. The analysis of the obtained relations is carried out. The influence of the die angle on the distribution of residual stresses is most noticeable at small reductions. After the maximum values of residual stresses are reached at the reduction values of 35-40%, they noticeable decrease occurs.
