Evaluation of the effect of precipitation on mechanical properties of Advanced High Strength Steel strip was the objective of the project. Physical simulations of the multipass rolling were performed in plane strain compression. Different pass schedules were applied to investigate the influence of strain accumulation during the last two deformations on the subsequent microstructure and product properties. Various coiling temperatures were applied and an effect of precipitation in the coil was investigated. VirtRoll computer system, which is a digital twin of the full scale mill, was applied to reproduce investigated hot rolling routes.
