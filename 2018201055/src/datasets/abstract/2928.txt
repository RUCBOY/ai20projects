During the last decade, deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have produced a devastating impact on computer vision, yielding exceptional results on a variety of problems, including analysis of medical images. Recently, these techniques have been extended to 3D images with the downside of a large increase in the computational load. In particular, state-of-the-art CNNs have been used for brain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging, with the aim of estimating the patients’ age. In fact, a large discrepancy between the real and the estimated age is a clear alarm for the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as some types of early dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. In this paper, we propose an effective alternative to 3D convolutions that guarantees a significant reduction of the computational requirements for this kind of analysis. The proposed architectures achieve comparable results with the competitor 3D methods, requiring only a fraction of the training time and GPU memory.
