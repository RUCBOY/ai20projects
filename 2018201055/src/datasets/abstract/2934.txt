Pathological Myopia (PM) is one among the main reason of visual defect in the world. Pathological myopia is associated with decaying changes in the retina. If it remains untreated it may lead to vision loss that canâ€™t be recoverable. The correct diagnosis of pathological myopia will facilitate proper treatment and improve disease management which reduce the growth of the disease. However, it is nearly impossible to scan the whole population. Computer-aided diagnosing tools in eye image study will build the method scalable and economical. This paper focuses on the problems of classification of Pathological myopia images and non-pathological myopia images and optical disc, fovea detection, localization, lesions (atrophy and detachment) segmentation with 400 samples provided by International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI). In this paper, a deep learning method with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is used for classification and U-net model is used for Image segmentation which shows that it achieves highly competitive results.
