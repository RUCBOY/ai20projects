This paper aims to look at the evolution of knowledge in management science, in its dynamic and its relation with the notions of activity and resource, as well as the impact of the general model (input data, processing, output data) used by information processing theories. In this logic, we try to show how the activity approach offers new perspectives, both in terms of the main orientations in resource-based theory (“competence-based management”, “knowledge based view”, “dynamic capabilities”) than on epistemological and foresight plans.
