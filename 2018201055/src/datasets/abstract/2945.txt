The authors have proposed the Active Textbook System (A-txt) as the next generation learning material system. A-txt is a system to enhance the textbook by adding digital content to the figures and formulas in a general book by using AR technology. Production of content and registration to the server can be done relatively easily using a general-purpose personal computer, and the content added to the book can be browed using the usersâ€™ own smart terminal. Therefore, the introduction cost can be reduced without the need for a dedicated machine. Also, once content is downloaded, it can be used offline. This point is the other advantage that other systems do not have. So far, A-txt was limited to iOS devices that hardware are standardized, but this time the system for Android devices, that have more users, have been developed. Although challenges remain for AR and 3D display, an application that meets practical requirements has been completed. Also, since the Android OS is free, there are a wide variety of terminals adopted. Therefore, recommended hardware specifications have been formulated by benchmark evaluation. Moreover, in order to solve some problems that became apparent in the development process, it was decided to change to an OS-independent system by using Unity.
