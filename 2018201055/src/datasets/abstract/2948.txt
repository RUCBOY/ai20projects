AlGaN metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxial growth simulation in a TMAl/TMGa/NH3/H2 system was studied to explain its growth rate and Al content. We proposed three kinds of Al- and Ga-containing polymers in this system. By using those polymers, we got good agreements in pressure, TMAl/(TMAl+TMGa) inlet ratio, and temperature dependences of AlGaN growth rate and its Al content between simulations and experiments, even at pressures higher than 40â€¯kPa. Our results showed that the formation of these polymers is enhanced under higher pressures. The simulation considering those polymers could explain the linearity in the TMAl/(TMAl+TMGa) inlet ratio dependences of growth rate and Al content at lower pressure and their non-linearity at higher pressure.
