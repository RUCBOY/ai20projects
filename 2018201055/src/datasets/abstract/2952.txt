Much research attention has been given to the behavioral outcomes of warning computer users about potential threats to their information security, primarily through the use of fear appeal messaging. This study explores not only the use of other types of external threat information (including vivid messaging and observational learning) but also the textual responses of computer users receiving the information, opening up the “black box” to their threat appraisal processes. Results indicate that maladaptive perceptions can appear throughout the appraisal process and that the type of external threat information can differently influence user attitudes.
