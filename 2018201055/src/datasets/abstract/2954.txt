Viruses are everywhere around us. Not only in our environment but also in virtual environment we are now using on daily basis. To be able to predict their growth it is necessary to understand them or even to develop them. The main problem was how to get rid of any harm in computer or even infrastructure and still be possible to simulate infiltration. Of course it is not an infiltration from real deep point of view. This paper describes how this problem was handled, which type of malware was used, briefly introduces its implementation and also virtual environment this threat was tested. As preferred virtualization tool docker was chosen. Images created in docker and after then run as a containers fit to this work. Alpine was chosen as mini virtual docker image for our purposes. For implementation part C++and a Qt5 framework was utilized to reduce the time with implementation which are already done. Frameworks or OS-es do not provide all important tools and this happened also in this case. Because of that some additional tools has been installed. Most of them are network based tools which are important for this work because this worm implementation communicates over the LAN and communication is on udp based packets. Result of this investigation is fully virtual platform which can be used for testing and improved also for other types of features related to viral usage.
