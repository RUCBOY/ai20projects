Celiac disease is a common immune response when gluten is ingested. Over time, this response will impair the lining of the small intestine and result in malabsorption. This could bring about critical health complications. However, the symptoms of celiac disease vary and hence, it is relatively challenging to make an accurate diagnosis. This results in a high percentage of misdiagnoses. Therefore, a computer-aided detection (CAD) system is proposed to overcome the challenges. Hence, this study employed the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose the video images, after which textural and nonlinear features were extracted. Thereafter, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) was performed to choose 30 optimal features for classification. An accuracy level of 86.47%, and sensitivity and specificity of 88.43% and 84.60%, respectively, was achieved with the 10-fold cross-validation strategy. Moreover, an accuracy of 85.91% was attained with the leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) technique. This methodology demonstrates potential for accurately identifying celiac disease. It can therefore be noted that the developed CAD system may improve the diagnostic performance in the detection of celiac disease, and thus reduce the number of misdiagnoses.
