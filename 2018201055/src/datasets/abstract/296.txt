Existing domain adaptation approaches focus on taking advantage of easy samples, i.e, target samples which are easier for adaptation. In previous work, tough, or hard, target samples are generally regarded as outliers or just being left to chance. As a result, the adaptation of tough target samples remains as a challenging problem in the community. In this paper, we report three novel ideas for domain adaptation: 1) splitting target samples into easy and tough ones; 2) deploying different strategies for samples with different adaptation difficulties; 3) leveraging easy samples to facilitate tough ones. Furthermore, we present a novel approach, named challenging tough sample networks (CTSN), to practice the three ideas and tame tough samples. Specifically, in our approach, a CNN with domain adaptation layers is first used to rapidly handle the easy samples and identify the tough ones. Then, a GAN with two classifiers is tailored to adapt the tough samples. The GAN leverages classification discrepancy and easy samples to tame the tough ones. Extensive experiments on both classic and large-scale benchmarks verify that both easy and tough samples do exist in real-world datasets and our approach is able to handle them.
