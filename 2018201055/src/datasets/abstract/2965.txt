Departing from a two-dimensional hyperbolic system that describes the interaction between some activator and inhibitor substances in chemical reactions, we investigate a general form of that model using a finite-difference approach. The model under investigation is a nonlinear system consisting of two coupled partial differential equations with generalized reaction terms. The presence of two-dimensional diffusive terms consisting of fractional operators of the Riesz type is considered here, using spatial differentiation orders in the set (0,1)âˆª(1,2]. We impose initial conditions on a closed and bounded rectangle, and a finite-difference methodology based on the use of fractional centered differences is proposed. Among the most important results of this work, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of the solutions of the numerical method, and establish analytically the second-order consistency of our scheme. Moreover, the discrete energy method is employed to prove the stability and the quadratic convergence of the technique. Some numerical simulations obtained through our method show the presence of Turing patterns and wave instabilities, in agreement with some reports found in the literature on superdiffusive hyperbolic activator-inhibitor systems. We show numerically that the presence of Turing patterns is independent of the size of the spatial domain. As a new application, we show that Turing patterns are also present in subdiffusive scenarios.
