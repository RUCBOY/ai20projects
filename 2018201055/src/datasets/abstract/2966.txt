Face recognition (FR) has become increasingly significant in many computer vision applications. However, with the rapid deployment of FR, the privacy of face images has been a growing concern, especially when FR is performed in cloud platforms. Several privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) schemes have been proposed to outsource FR without divulging private information. However, most existing schemes are built by employing partially or fully homomorphic cryptosystems, which contain a series of computationally expensive operations and require interactions between users and service providers. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient scheme to achieve privacy-preserving face recognition in the cloud. Using randomness techniques, we propose an affine transformation, which consists of permutation, diffusion and shift transformations, to protect the privacy of faces. Both projection (feature extraction) and recognition procedures are performed in encrypted domain without interaction. We also propose an optimization technique to increase the efficiency of encryption. Extensive experimental analysis is performed to demonstrate the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Theoretical comparison is also conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.
