Wind erosion is a natural soil degradation process that threatens agriculture in many locations. We have used several different methods, including wind tunnels, to analyze this type of soil erosion. In this paper we present a new wind tunnel design that enables very simple analysis of soil wind erosion. The equipment is lightweight and can be folded up for easier transport. This very easy-to-install prototype combines laser telemetry, computer vision, and sediment collection analytical techniques. Tests can be done more quickly, so manifold areas can be covered in a short time. The innovative use of sensors allows the experiments to be replicated the same way anywhere, so different experiments can be easily compared. This wind tunnel is designed to be used in any terrain and has an automatic data collection and analysis system.
