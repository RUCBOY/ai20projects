Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious-contagious disease that affects mainly the lungs, ranking in the 10 main causes of death in the world. Non-adherence or non-treatment of TB may prolong transmissibility, increase the risk of drug resistance and lead to patient death. One step forward is the use of smartphones for monitoring the medication intake via video (VDOT). VDOT is a more acceptable and cost-effective option than the traditional DOT (in person). However, the VDOT system requires a professional (verifying agent) to check all medication intake daily. Based on an initiative that aims to replace the verifying agent with an artificial intelligence tool capable of validating it automatically through computer vision techniques (AI-based VDOT), the main goal of this work is to measure the acceptance and perception of Brazilian health professionals on the AI-Based VDOT before implementing this technology by using a quantitative questionnaire as instrument. To achieve this, we have developed a proposal of study protocol that describes the steps to create, apply and validate this research.
