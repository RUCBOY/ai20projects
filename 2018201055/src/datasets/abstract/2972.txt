Assessing the quality of date fruits manually is a labour-intensive task. Furthermore, quality of the date fruits stored in the storage may degrade with time and it is important to inspect the quality of date routinely. After date harvesting, the industrial companies start the inspection of dates. Inspection of date fruit is to isolate the damaged or defected dates from the good one. Industrial factories demand a high quality and fast production that can only be achieved by automatic inspection. In this paper, we propose a framework for inspection of the external quality of the date fruits through the image processing method. Images of the date fruit are classified into good quality and sugar-defected by using bag of feature (BOF) method. The methodology includes five main stages including key points detection, feature extraction, creating a dictionary, vector quantization and classification. Proposed framework is tested on the dataset collected by the authors using two types of key-points detection methods. Best classification accuracy for grid based search was 99% and 84% for SURF based key-points detection method on the testing dataset.
