Learning technologies are becoming universal in health professional education. Despite the potential philosophical and ideological dissonance between CM and technology, the actual use of learning technologies by CM students is currently unknown. As such, there is a need to explore the prevalence and nature of use of educational technologies by CM students.
A cross-sectional survey examining students’ behaviours and attitudes to learning technologies at the Endeavour College of Natural Health. Survey items focused on student demographic and educational background, and their use of technology. Chi-square tests were used to examine bivariate relationships and the characteristics of technology use based on respondents’ age were determined using a backward stepwise logistic regression.
There were 576 responses to the survey. The majority of respondents reported having a mobile phone (96.2%) or a laptop (85.9%), rather than a desktop computer (24.7%). Of those with phones, 92% had a smart phone. Almost all students access their emails every day (84%). Older students (>35 years old) were found to be more likely to have a desktop computer (OR 1.9) and access LinkedIn (OR 2.95), but were less likely to use an eBook reader (OR 2.63) or Facebook (OR 0.21).
CM educational institutions need to adapt in relation to teaching and learning due to the changing use of and impact of technologies by more non- traditional students. This study points to the need for further research to explore the values, attitudes and use of technology by faculty in complementary medicine institutions.
