Mobile robots represent a very attractive and multidisciplinary field with a lot of applications and scientific research possibilities. The development of microcomputers, single board computers and embedded systems has helped to deploy low-cost solutions for this domain. In this paper is proposed such a low cost mobile robot platform with fixed four wheel chassis, commended by Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno interfaces. The mobile robot has the ability to move into 2D environments as line follower robot with mapping, navigation, and obstacle avoidance features. The platform contains also one degree of freedom (DOF) robotic arm for lifting and transport of the obstacles.
