ICT (Information and Communications Technology) has three components: information technology equipment (computers and related hardware), communication equipment, and software. They comprise IS/IT (Information Systems/Information Technology). The literature indicates that there are numerous studies describing IT application in all industries and only few focus on PBOs (Project-Based Organizations), most of them are limited to construction industry. Presentation and discussion of the findings from empirical studies related to the software utilization and its differentiation in PBOs of various industries and size are the main objectives of the paper. The research concentrates on middle and large PBOs operating in Poland. The crucial findings from the conducted study are that PBOs utilize in most cases commonly known software, such as office suite, and IT tools integrating various areas of entities â€“ such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) systems. The most common software supporting project management are Microsoft products. The research points out that there is a remarkable difference in software utilization between entities from various industries (construction, ICT, and others), also there is a remarkable difference in software utilization between middle and large PBOs.
