The production of a food product is a major challenge for any industry, taking the responsibility of guaranteeing a product as high as possible. The advancement of today’s technology has created very suitable conditions for product management by creating very clever process monitoring systems, as in our case, such as the brewing process. Beer industries do not possess a high technological complication compared to those of the chemical industry, but the possibility to create technological complications in the beer industry is very easy, one of which is cyberattack in the automatic process control. In this scientific research it is scientifically proven that the points for cybernetic attack in the beer process are in the bioreactors and the fermenters, the reason is that in the two strong points in the process during the work contain high pressures. Cybernetics with non-trace viruses can hit powerful computer weapons in control of the brewing process, possibly causing an explosion, and the released heat will be approximately 270°C from the biomass of bioreactors and fermenters in the industry. This study is realized as a necessity to have as much security as possible from incidents that can happen from cyber-attacks and we have our very powerful points in preventing the destruction of the industry, which is followed by large economic damages for an industry.
