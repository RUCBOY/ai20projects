The present PCR instrument is based on the Peltier semiconductor to achieve temperature cycling, but continuous photographing is not allowed and the self-contained timing software was seriously lagging. Therefore, from the perspective of photoelectric control, the conventional PCR machine was combined with a smartphone and PC, and an optical and electrical feedback automatic fluorescence detection system was designed to achieve quantitative real-time PCR. Through the script, camera timing was controlled by comparing the changes on the screen in the adjacent time, and automatic photo feedback is realized. This experiment has proven that this method can greatly improve the accuracy of the time to photograph and clearness of the photos. The smartphone connected to a computer installed on the PCR can be used after debugging. Compared with quantitative real-time PCR, conventional PCR is more cost-effective on the basis of detection requirements.
