Abnormal changes in the geometry of retinal blood vessels is often a key indicator of certain ocular patholo- gies. Currently, the detection of such pathological changes is largely a manual labor-intensive process that must be performed by expert clinicians to ensure a correct diagnosis. Although there have been previous efforts to automate such diagnostic procedures using computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) applications, these computerized methods seem to lack the necessary sensitivity to detect blood vessels which are of low con- trast, i.e. they are not easily distinguished from their surrounding background. In order to improve CAD detection of low contrast blood vessels, a specialized filter construction is proposed with functionality which can be implemented as an add-on module to enhance the performance of existing CAD blood vessel detector applications. The improved low-contrast detection capability of the specialized filters has been validated by a series of tests in which the proposed technique outperforms other state-of-the-art CAD applications when processing retinal fundus images extracted from publicly available image databases.
