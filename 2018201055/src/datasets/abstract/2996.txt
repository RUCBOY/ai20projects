In this paper, we demonstrate an approach of fabricating photonic lattices by designing a rotating beam selector, and we name the approach as multiple groups of double beam alternate interference. This method simplifies the interference configuration of multiple beams. And the structure of light field induced by this method has more concise symmetry compared to that obtained directly by the interference of multiple beams. And we can also analyze the interference beams configuration that produce the lattices as long as we know the structure of the lattices. We experimentally fabricate two-dimensional square photonic lattices in self-defocusing iron-doped lithium niobate photorefractive crystal by two groups of double beam alternate interference. And we analyze the structure of two-dimensional square photonic lattices by plane wave guiding, Brillouin zone spectroscopy and far field pattern and we make computer simulation of the light field pattern. Besides, we design a rotating beam selector and obtain the computer simulation pattern of five groups of double beam alternate interference.
