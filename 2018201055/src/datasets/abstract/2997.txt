This paper presents some insights on introducing control concepts to middle and high school STEM students. It summarizes the authorâ€™s experience in introducing control to such students at multiple workshops preceding control conferences. In Part 1 (Abramovitch (2019)), we share here the ideas behind the success of these talks. In Part 2 (this paper), we show how to discuss control systems math to students who have not had calculus or differential equations.
