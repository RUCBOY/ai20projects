To visually label the copyright of 2D CAD (Computer aided design) engineering graphics, a reversible visible watermarking based on graphics fusion is proposed. For a given watermark graphics, the lines are first converted into polylines, and a random perturbation is performed to each vertex by using a random seed. Secondly, the host graphics are equally divided into multiple regions, and then the centers of these regions are calculated. The center of each watermark graphics is aligned with the center of each region. After that, the watermark graphics are scaled to be suitable for the size of these regions. Finally, the watermark graphics are iteratively embedded by fusing the host graphics and the watermark graphics. The host graphics can be completely recovered from the fused graphics by the authorized users who know the secret key. Experimental results validate its effectiveness, and the analysis demonstrates that it has a certain robustness against translation, rotation, scaling, and entity deletion.
