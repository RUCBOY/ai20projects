Human–computer interaction (HCI) plays a vital role in modern intelligent systems, such as brain–machine integration, human action recognition, telemedicine, and somatosensory game. A decision support system is a combination of the information system and decision-making technology. Visual human–computer interaction decision-making is a key technique in the decision support system. This paper proposes a new visual decision-making system applicable for industrial applications, i.e. data mining topics. To assist the performance of the proposed visual decision-making system, it is designed for data mining technique applications. Furthermore, the architecture of the decision support system is analyzed based on practical data mining case study. The comprehensive experiment shows that the proposed method is effective and robust in comparison to other methods.
