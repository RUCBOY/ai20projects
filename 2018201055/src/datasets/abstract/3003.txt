Due to he complexity of the Internet of Things systems, embedded devices require complex hardware, usually composed of various microprocessors communicating with each other. This calls for deep understanding of communication protocols and features offered by various components for designers and programmers alike. Unfortunately, the available hardware platforms for prototyping IoT devices are not adapted to such complex design and do not tackle these aspects. In the paper we propose the Copernicus board, composed of two different microprocessors, focusing on the software aspects of IoT device design. The device is used in the Introduction to IoT course which is part of the Computer Science curriculum at AGH University of Science and Technology. At the end of the paper we summarize student interest in the course, in the form of statistics.
