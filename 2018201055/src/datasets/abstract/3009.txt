Answers to the questions of which instructional methods are suitable for school, what instructional methods should be applied in teaching individual subjects and how instructional methods support the act of learning represent challenges to general education and education in individual subjects. This study focuses on the empirical examination of learning outcome with respect to two instructional methods: programmed instruction and reciprocal teaching. An SPF-2 × 2•2 design is used to control instructional method, time and class context. Learning outcome on search queries is assessed with reference to multi-choice test items. The empirical findings show that learning with programmed instruction performs better than reciprocal teaching.
