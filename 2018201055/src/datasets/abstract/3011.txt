We give an abstract model1 of parts and part-hood relations, of Stanisław Leśniewski's mereology [2]. Mereology applies to software application domains such as the financial service industry, railway systems, road transport systems, health care, oil pipelines, secure [IT] systems, etc. We relate this model to axiom systems for mereology, showing satisfiability, and show that for every mereology there corresponds a class of Communicating Sequential Processes [3], that is: a λ-expression.
