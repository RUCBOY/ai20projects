Advances in eye-tracking technology have led to better human-computer interaction, and involve controlling a computer without any kind of physical contact. This research describes the transformation of a commercial eye-tracker for use as an alternative peripheral device in human-computer interactions, implementing a pointer that only needs the eye movements of a user facing a computer screen, thus replacing the need to control the software by hand movements. The experiment was performed with 30 test individuals who used the prototype with a set of educational videogames. The results show that, although most of the test subjects would prefer a mouse to control the pointer, the prototype tested has an empirical precision similar to that of the mouse, either when trying to control its movements or when attempting to click on a point of the screen.
