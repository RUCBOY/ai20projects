Biomedical signals have got very incredible reach to the people outside clinical domain as devices are developed that can be controlled using one’s imagination and this is the very booming area of research nowadays. An effective way of using Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is using the Brain Computer Interaction (BCI) and Electroencephalogram (EEG) which can extend the people’s access to use machines specifically for specially abled persons. Generally, EEG is a costly matter which is not every time affordable by any common person. Here in this proposed system, we tried to explore the possibility of single channel EEG through which a person can communicate to computer according to his/her neurosignal excitement which are classified as Attention, Meditation and Blink strength and then can be interpreted into effective Human Machine Interaction (HMI). The proposed algorithm here uses brainwaves (voluntary blinks as a control tool in BCI) detected using Neurosky Mindwave Mobile headset from the frontal lobe (because it offers EEG clarity since this is the forehead area with minimal hair). This proposed system can be extended for typing, gaming, entertainment as well as for daily life interaction purposes. It can also be extended as a non-verbal communication medium for specially abled persons. The experiment conducted using the proposed system revealed significant development in accessing computer and typing skill. We tried to explore scan keyboard which can be operated by neural signals captured by the Neurosky Mindwave Mobile Headset Single channel EEG Headset.
