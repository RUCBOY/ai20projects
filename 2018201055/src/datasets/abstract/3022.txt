In an era of accountability, implementation of computer-based instruction (CBI) may be attractive to personalize learning and raise test scores. Although prior work has examined how CBI may serve these purposes, we demonstrate that it also has an unintentional impact on how teachers allocate time in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential collateral damage of implementing CBI in elementary classrooms. Using the implementation of the supplemental CBI, Spatial Temporal (ST) Math as a case study, we analyze how 468 teachers report spending instructional minutes in each subject per week, and which subjects are reported as being limited to accommodate the program. Results reveal teachers vary in time spent across subjects and from where they draw time for ST Math. Most time for ST Math comes from a reduction of non-math core subject time with some variation according to grade. We provide initial evidence of teacher autonomy in subject time allocation within the context of CBI implementation; further study is needed to illuminate drivers of teacher's decisions.
