The EXchange FORmat (EXFOR) experimental nuclear reaction database and the associated Web interface provide access to the wealth of low- and intermediate-energy nuclear reaction physics data. This resource is based on numerical data sets and bibliographical information of âˆ¼22,000 experiments since the beginning of nuclear science. The principles of the computer database organization, its extended contents and Web applications development are described. New capabilities for the data sets uploads, renormalization, covariance matrix, and inverse reaction calculations are presented.
The EXFOR database, updated monthly, provides an essential support for nuclear data evaluation, application development, and research activities. It is publicly available at the websites of the International Atomic Energy Agency Nuclear Data Section, http://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor, the U.S. National Nuclear Data Center, http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor, and the mirror sites in China, India and Russian Federation.
