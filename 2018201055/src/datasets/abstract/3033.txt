In order to make use of the advantages of optical computing and promote the application and popularization of Ternary Optical Computer (TOC), this paper proposes a new computing-data model, presents the corresponding computing-data file in detail, and gives the implementation method of programming application with the model files. It tries to set up a bridge between users and TOC. Experimental results show that the model presented in this paper is correct and the implementation method is feasible. The model can better simplify TOCâ€™s application process, and allow users to apply TOC to carry out various computational applications without needing to understand any details of optical implementation.
