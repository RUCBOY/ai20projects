Different approaches have been used in order to represent and build control engineering concepts for the computer. Software applications for these fields are becoming more and more demanding each day, and new representation schemas are continuously being developed. This paper describes a study of the use of knowledge models represented in ontologies for building Computer Aided Control Systems Design (CACSD) tools. The use of this approach allows the construction of formal conceptual structures that can be stated independently of any software application and be used in many different ones. In order to show the advantages of this approach, an ontology and an application have been built for the domain of design of lead/lag controllers with the root locus method, presenting the results and benefits found.
