Nowadays, the alternative methods of human-computer interactions are in development. These methods can drastically improve usability of cyber-physical systems and devices, as mobile robots, especially for disabled people. Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are among them. Unfortunately, BCIs arenâ€™t reliable enough to handle critical devices outside lab environments since the quality of command recognition can be influenced by external conditions, as noise pollution that can distract the user of BCI. In this paper, we are presenting the experimental study results of the noise pollution influence in the form of unwanted music on the quality of control through BCI. In general, the obtained results showed the negative impact on the accuracy of control for the most of participants.
