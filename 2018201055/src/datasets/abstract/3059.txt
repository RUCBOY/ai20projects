Recently, the most computer and digital systems are built based on the parallelism to increase their speed of processing.
The complications of these systems are increasing proportionally with the complexity of the used parallelism methodologies. According to the growing of this complexity, this research proposes a modification to enhance designing tasks by the concept of the 3-dimensions easily.
This research introduces a novel terminology called “Bit-Vector-Matrix”. Moreover, this research modifies the standard logic symbols beside reformulates their conventional Boolean algebraic expressions to become more convenient and compatible with the “Bit-Vector-Matrix”.
We proposed novel logic gate symbols called “Peer-logic-gates”. They are useful for representing the intensive concurrent logical operations through intensive parallel digital buses in computer systems. In addition, they will be a promising teaching tool to instruct many computer courses.
This paper constructed based on the deterministic algorithm, realized using VHDL codes and evaluated by the reliable simulator “Modelsim”.
