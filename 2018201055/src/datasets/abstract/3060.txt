By analyzing the numerical representation of amplitude values in audio signals and integrating the time component, a representation for audio signals on quantum computers, FRQA, is proposed. The FRQA representation is a normalized state that facilitates basic audio signal operations targeting the amplitude and time parameters. The preparation and retrieval for FRQA are discussed and based on the resulting state, we realize the circuits to accomplish basic audio signal operations such as signal addition, signal inversion, signal delay, and signal reversal. In future, these operations can be employed as the major components to build advanced operations for specific applications as well as facilitate secure transmission of audio content in the quantum computing domain.
