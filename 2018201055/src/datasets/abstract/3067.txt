Mind mapping is an effective diagramming tool which can be used to generate, visualize, structure, and classify ideas, solving problems etc. In this paper we focus on mind mapping application in programming language teaching for application-oriented undergraduate colleges. We adopt mind mapping teaching method to design and transform the abstract and invisible thinking mode into visible and radioactive thinking mode according to the teaching contents. The analysis and teaching practice show that it can strengthen the students’ ability of logical thinking and innovative thinking, motivate the development of students’ life-wide learning thinking, and enhance the students’ understanding.
