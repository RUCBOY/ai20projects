In the computer security and for any defensive strategy, computer viruses are very significant aspect. To understand their expansion and extension is very important component. In order to deal with this issue, we consider a fractional epidemiological model. In this article, we analyze moderate epidemiological model to describe computer viruses with an arbitrary order derivative having non-singular kernel. We obtain the solution of the problem by using an iterative method. By using the fixed-point theorem the existence of the solution is discussed. The uniqueness of the solution is verified. We perform some numerical simulations and show graphically to observe the impact of the arbitrary order derivative.
