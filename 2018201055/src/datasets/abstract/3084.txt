The purpose of this study was to design a simulation training system for fire safety inspection based on three key technologies which involved three-dimensional geographic information system technology, three-dimensional modeling technology and visualization of human-computer interaction technology. First, basic development ideas and guiding principles of the simulation training system were drawn from the analysis on current situations and actual demands of fire safety inspection practice training at present; Accordingly, the basic framework with three platform was designed, including back-stage administrator control platform, teachersâ€™ guidance platform and student training platform in front stage; as well as it was put forward to establish three-dimensional model not only consist of basic scene models and detail scene model base to diversify specific training scenes. Finally, functions of the system was divided into four modules from double angles of teaching staff and trainees respectively, including auxiliary self-learning, human-computer interaction, arrangements for training task, training effect feedback and evaluation. Fire safety inspection three-dimensional simulation training system could be applied to colleges or universities for fire profession teaching, fire brigades and fire safety key units to cultivate fire safety inspectors, and realize "practice training everywhere as well as teach, practice, test, assessment with seamless docking".
