Surgical correction of a symptomatic clavicular malunion requires simultaneous adjustment of the translation as well as the rotation in multiple planes. We describe a corrective osteotomy for a clavicle malunion using 3-D computer assisted preoperative-planning combined with patient-specific surgical guides, along with the benefits and disadvantages of this approach. This method enabled quantifying the malunion by comparing the malunited bone with the normal contralateral clavicle as a template. The postoperative results were encouraging with symmetrical shoulder anatomy and functional improvement. Therefore, we recommend this technique in patients with a symptomatic clavicle malunion, as it allows successful correction of the deformity.
