In this study, we seek to develop an analytic method to set key educational skills (ESs), using a student self-assessment questionnaire. It is difficult to set key academic skills for classes since few systematic methods are available. A survey featuring 24 ESs was conducted in three ICT classes in our university using a computer-assisted web-interviewing (CAWI) technique. The questionnaire results were analyzed through Studentsâ€™ T-test and multidimensional scaling (MDS). An MDS helps to visualize the similarities between these ESs. We demonstrated that the 24 skills can be classified into the following three skills: basic academic skills, practical academic skills, and interpersonal skills.
