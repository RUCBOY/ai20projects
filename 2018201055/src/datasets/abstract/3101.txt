We introduce HHL, a hierarchical variant of hybrid logic. We study first order correspondence results and prove a Hennessy-Milner like theorem relating (hierarchical) bisimulation and modal equivalence for HHL. Combining hierarchical transition structures with the ability to refer to specific states at different levels, this logic seems suitable to express and verify properties of hierarchical transition systems, a pervasive semantic structure in Computer Science.
