This paper aims to study the effect of 0.3% addition of Ge, Te and Ce on Cu-14%Al-4.5%Ni Shape memory alloys by building a computer model via MATLAB of two direction strain temperature with the calculation of enthalpy(ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) results showed the Ge addition gave the best results in the thermodynamic properties and also in strain ring ,also the use of a mathematical model via MATLAB to calculate the shape memory strain with compared with the actual results , it showed a close ratio with the actual results of the thermo-mechanical testing also results shown an increase in enthalpy entropy and heat flow for all alloy the Ge addition gave the best results as for the hysteresis loops the Ce and Ge Addition gave the best results in general the computer model results and the thermo mechanical showed about 2.7%deffernece in results.
