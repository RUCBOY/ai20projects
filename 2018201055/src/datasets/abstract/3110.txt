In the aeronautic field, the required accuracy of finished parts is difficult to achieve with the best value for money. It is necessary to simulate the impact of manufacturing deviations in order to verify that the manufacturing process meets the requirements in spite of dispersions in each phase.
With support of research works from LURPA ENS Cachan University Paris-Sud and software engineering from DPS, Safran Aircraft Engines has developed a Manufacturing Computer Aided Tolerancing Software that aims to automatize the manufacturing specification transfer and optimize the manufacturing tolerances. This software uses input from the model based definition and from the tolerancing analysis performed by ANATOLE 3D (software edited by AIRBUS and DPS).
