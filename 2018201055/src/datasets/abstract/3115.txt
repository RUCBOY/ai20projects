Transport studies constantly rely on surveys among travelers. Computer assisted web interview is the most popular survey mode. However, respondents complete online surveys nowadays using smartphones, tablets or traditional devices. We address three questions related to this development: how important are mobile respondents; how to deal with mobile respondents; and what is the effect of mobile response in a survey? In order to answer these questions, we used a series of information dense meta-analyses and state-of-the-art literature. Our results reveal that one out of every three respondents used a mobile device in 2016. The profile of mobile respondents adheres to the profiles of hard-to-reach candidates. Four design strategies for mixed-device surveys are identified and discussed. By taking an active approach to mixed-device surveys, multiple issues associated with mobile response can be overcome, i.e. differences in completion times and break-offs can be minimized. Mobile respondents appreciate redesigned surveys. Our results are in favor of facilitating mobile respondents with an adaptive or responsive web design in surveys.
