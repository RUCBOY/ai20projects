This cross-sectional study investigated musculoskeletal discomfort and computer use in university staff, through the use of online questionnaires. Results showed a high prevalence of staff reported musculoskeletal discomfort during the preceding year (80%), with neck (60%), shoulder (53%) and lower back discomfort (47%) being the most common. Most believed discomfort was caused by work, although neck discomfort was significantly less in those reporting excellent mental health (OR 0.44, p < 0.01). Computer navigation was performed primarily by mouse (77%); however, using a touch pad increased the odds (OR 1.17, p < 0.01) of wrist discomfort and the belief it was caused by work (OR 1.19, p < 0.01). Few staff attended ergonomic training (16%) or requested workstation assessments (26%). However, high rates of staff reporting musculoskeletal discomfort sought professional treatment (range: 35.2% wrist/hand to 65.0% shoulder). Strategies are needed to address uptake of preventive measures and reduce reliance on medical treatments following musculoskeletal discomfort in universities.
