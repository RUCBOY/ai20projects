Electroencephalography (EEG) experiments often require several computers to ensure accurate stimulus presentation and data collection. However, this requirement can make it more difficult to perform such experiments in mobile settings within, or outside, the laboratory.
Computer miniaturisation and increasing processing power allow for EEG experiments to become more portable. Our goal is to show that a Latte Panda, a small Windows 10 computer, can be used to accurately collect EEG data in a similar manner to a laptop. Using a stationary bike, we also suggest that the Latte Panda will allow for more portable EEG experiments.
Significant and reliable MMN and P3 responses, event-related potentials (ERPs) typically associated with auditory oddball tasks, were observed and were consistent when using either the laptop or Latte Panda for EEG data collection. Similar MMN and P3 ERPs were also measured in the sitting and stationary biking conditions while using a Latte Panda for data collection.
Data recorded by the Latte Panda computer produced comparable and equally reliable results to the laptop. As well, similar ERPs during sitting and biking would suggest that EEG experiments can be conducted in more mobile situations despite the increased noise and artifacts associated with muscle movement.
Our results show that the Latte Panda is a low-cost, more portable alternative to a laptop computer for recording EEG data. Such a device will further allow for more portable and mobile EEG experimentation in a wider variety of environments.
