Some problems of a real-time distributed computer system testing are considered. The authors approach suggests the introduction of redundancy into the system being diagnosed, which in essence is an event model of the DS. The model is a dynamical periodically time-varying system, linear in a binary field. Based on this model rational procedure for designing the testing of a distributed system is proposed.
