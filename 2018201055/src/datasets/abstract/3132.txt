Computer programs are a ubiquitous part of modern society, yet little is known about the psychological processes that underlie reviewing code. We applied the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) to investigate the influence of computer code comments on perceptions of code trustworthiness. The study explored the influence of validity, placement, and style of comments in code on trustworthiness perceptions and time spent on code. Results indicated valid comments led to higher trust assessments and more time spent on the code. Properly placed comments led to lower trust assessments and had a marginal effect on time spent on code; however, the effect was no longer significant after controlling for effects of the source code. Low style comments led to marginally higher trustworthiness assessments, but high style comments led to longer time spent on the code. Several interactions were also found. Our findings suggest the relationship between code comments and perceptions of code trustworthiness is not as straightforward as previously thought. Additionally, the current paper extends the HSM to the programming literature.
