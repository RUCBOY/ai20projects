The ground-based observations of near-Earth asteroids at large phase angles have shown some feature: the linear polarization maximum position of the high-albedo E-type asteroids shifted markedly towards smaller phase angles (αmax ≈ 70°) with respect to that for the moderate-albedo S-type asteroids (αmax ≈ 110°), weakly depending on the wavelength. To study this phenomenon, the theoretical approach and the modified T-matrix method (the so-called Sh-matrices method) were used. Theoretical approach was devoted to finding the values of αmax, corresponding to maximal values of positive polarization Pmax. Computer simulations were performed for an ensemble of random Gaussian particles, whose scattering properties were averaged over with different particle orientations and size parameters in the range X = 2.0 ... 21.0, with the power law distribution X − k, where k = 3.6. The real parts of the refractive index mr were 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7. Imaginary part of refractive index varied from mi = 0.0 to mi = 0.5. Both theoretical approach and computer simulation showed that the value of αmax strongly depends on the refractive index. The increase of mi leads to increased αmax and Pmax. In addition, computer simulation shows that the increase of the real part of the refractive index reduces Pmax. Whereas E-type high-albedo asteroids have smaller values of mi, than S -type asteroids, we can conclude, that value of αmax of E-type asteroids should be smaller than for S –type ones. This is in qualitative agreement with the observed effect in asteroids.
