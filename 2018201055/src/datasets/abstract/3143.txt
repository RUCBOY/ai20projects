Image-based and imageless computer-assisted total knee arthroplasty (CATKA) has become increasingly popular. This study aims to compare outcomes, including perioperative complications and transfusion rate, between CATKA and conventional total knee arthroplasty (TKA), as well as between image-based and imageless CATKA.
Using the 9th revision of the International Classification of Diseases codes, we queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 2005 to 2011 to identify unilateral conventional TKA, image-based, and imageless CATKAs as well as in-hospital complications and transfusion rates.
A total of 787,809 conventional TKAs and 13,246 CATKAs (1055 image-based and 12,191 imageless) were identified. The rate of CATKA increased 23.13% per year from 2005 to 2011. Transfusion rates in conventional TKA and CATKA cases were 11.73% and 8.20% respectively (P < .001) and 6.92% in image-based vs 8.27% in imageless (P = .023). Perioperative complications occurred in 4.50%, 3.47%, and 3.41% of cases after conventional, imageless, and imaged-based CATKAs, respectively. Using multivariate analysis, perioperative complications were significantly higher in conventional TKA compared to CATKA (odds ratio = 1.17, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.33, P = .01). There was no significant difference between imageless and image-based CATKA (P = .34). Length of hospital stay and hospital charges were not significantly different between groups (P > .05).
CATKA has low complication rates and may improve patient outcomes after TKA. CATKA, especially the image-based technique, may reduce in-hospital complications and transfusion without increasing hospital charges and length of hospital stay significantly. Large prospective studies with long follow-up are required to verify potential benefits of CATKA.
