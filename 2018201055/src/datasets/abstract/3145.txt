Cloud manufacturing is quickly emerging as an infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), analogue for distributed production and supply chains, that integrates manufacturing providers and customers. This paper develops a cloud-based cyberphysical platform as a new service for spawning and organizing cloud manufacturing networks of computer numerical control (CNC) resources, provisioned and managed over the internet. The proposed layered architecture consists of hardware, virtualization, operating system, and network layers. Using modern web development technology, an operating system is created that services and virtualizes manufacturing resources in the network. This operating system offers a new, and much-needed model for physical resources and application software distribution in Cloud Manufacturing. The platform is designed with a micro-service architecture, that is used for manufacturing nodes and software applications or ‘assets’, and implemented in a Mongo, Express, Angular, Node (MEAN) stack.
