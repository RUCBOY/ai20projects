It is now widely accepted that biochemical reaction networks can perform computations. Examples are kinetic proof reading, gene regulation, or signalling networks. For many of these systems it was found that their computational performance is limited by a trade-off between the metabolic cost, the speed and the accuracy of the computation. In order to gain insight into the origins of these trade-offs, we consider entropy-driven computers as a model of biochemical computation. Using tools from stochastic thermodynamics, we show that entropy-driven computation is subject to a trade-off between accuracy and metabolic cost, but does not involve time-trade-offs. Time trade-offs appear when it is taken into account that the result of the computation needs to be measured in order to be known. We argue that this measurement process, although usually ignored, is a major contributor to the cost of biochemical computation.
