In this work, numerical study on the thermal behaviour and subsequent heat transfer enhancement of cylindrical micro-fin heat sink with artificial surface roughness is analyzed using Chebychev spectral collocation method. The developed thermal models consider variable thermal properties in accordance with linear, exponential and power laws. The numerical solutions are used to carry out parametric studies and to establish the thermal performance enhancement of the rough fins over the existing smooth fins. Following the results obtained from simulations, it is established that the thermal efficiency of the micro-fin is significantly affected by the geometric ratio, nonlinear thermal conductivity parameter, thermo-geometric parameter and the surface roughness of the micro-fin. In addition, the results show that geometric ratio and the surface roughness of the fin enhance its thermal performance. The fin efficiency ratio which is the ratio of the efficiency of the rough fin to the efficiency of the smooth fin is found to be greater than unity when the rough and the smooth fins are subjected to the same operations with the same geometrical, physical, thermal and material properties. From the investigation, it is established that improved thermal management of electronic and thermal systems can be achieved through the use of artificial rough surface fins or heat sink.
