Endowing virtual agents with desired personality impression is one of the most important considerations when designers create agents. Color appearance of agents has been suggested to be able to convey personality impression but how to design the right color appearance to obtain the desired personality impression is still a challenge to unexperienced designers, since they have little information on how colors evoke personality impression; moreover, the design become more difficult when multiple design goals need to be considered simultaneously. To respond to the challenge, we propose an automated method for creating color appearance of agents using a multi-objective interactive genetic algorithm. The method can automatically generate the desired color appearance that can convey desired personality impression, has harmonious color combinations, and express designers' preference. The experimental results show that our method can lower the barrier for designers and speed up the design process.
