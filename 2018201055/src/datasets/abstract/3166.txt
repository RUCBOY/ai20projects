Subtle changes in instrumental activities of daily living often accompany the onset of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) but are difficult to measure using conventional tests.
Weekly online survey metadata metrics, annual neuropsychological tests, and an instrumental activity of daily living questionnaire were examined in 110 healthy older adults with intact cognition (mean age = 85 years) followed up for up to 3.6 years; 29 transitioned to MCI during study follow-up.
In the baseline period, incident MCI participants completed their weekly surveys 1.4 hours later in the day than stable cognitively intact participants, P = .03, d = 0.47. Significant associations were found between earlier survey start time of day and higher memory (r = −0.34; P < .001) and visuospatial test scores (r = −0.37; P < .0001). Longitudinally, incident MCI participants showed an increase in survey completion time by 3 seconds per month for more than the year before diagnosis compared with stable cognitively intact participants (β = 0.12, SE = 0.04, t = 2.8; P = .006).
Weekly online survey metadata allowed for detection of changes in everyday cognition before transition to MCI.
