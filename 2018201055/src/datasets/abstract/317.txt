With the advent of a hyper-connected society, expectations for blockchain technology and its potential have increased. Blockchain technology is emerging as a method to solve security vulnerabilities in the IoT and mobile devices that are already used in various industrial fields. However, the security problem is still one of the most critical issues. The conventional blockchain has a problem in which the performance decreases as the number of participants increases because all of the users participate in the verification. As a result, it is not suitable for traditional IoT and mobile environments in which resources are limited.
This work presents an approach of applying a blockchain system in a D2D (Device-to-Device) environment and proposes solutions for the problems of conventional mobile device communication and blockchain consensus algorithms. After a blockchain system in a wireless network environment is separated into an off-blockchain and an on-blockchain, the divided blockchains are processed in three steps. In the first stage of 0ff-blockchain, our proposal confirms the safety of IoT devices that transfer confidential data. In the next stage, the devices reduce the risk of eavesdropping from a third party by calculating the security capacity using the resources of the mobile devices which register for membership on a private blockchain. In the last stage, the devices join the blockchain consensus process. The reliability of the consensus and the performance of the system are improved through calculation of the real participation probability of the participants by the communication elements and by determining whether each node is a selfish participant. As a result, our work proposes a consensus algorithm suitable for D2D communication and a SBC(Selective Blockchain) system considering environmental characteristics.
