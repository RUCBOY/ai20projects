The EUCLID/V1 integrated computer code has been developed for the safety analysis and justification of reactor facilities with fast reactors under normal operating conditions and design basis accidents. The EUCLID/V1 code uses the BERKUT module to describe physical processes occurring in fuel rods with oxide or nitride fuel in fast reactors. The quasi two dimensional approach is employed to simulate the thermomechanical behavior of fuel rods. Verification and validation of the BERKUT module have been carried out using analytical and numerical tests and the experimental data observed in the in-pile fuel performance studies. The results of validation and verification obtained taking into account the uncertainties of the fuel rod fabrication data, material properties and irradiation conditions indicate that the BERKUT module describes adequately the fuel rod behavior in fast reactors.
