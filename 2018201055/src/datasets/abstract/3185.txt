Nowadays, Web Services has become one of the hot issues in the area of computer sciences, that makes an ability to collect capabilities and components in a unique interface to fulfill the user’s requirements. Sometimes, two or more services can be found in available list of services; therefore, there should be a possibility for selecting the best services from discovered list which can satisfy the user’s needs. The selected services should optimize the overall QoS of the composed application, while satisfying all the constraints specified by the consumer on individual QoS parameters. In this paper, we propose a contrast analysis between two Skyline algorithms and evaluate them experimentally.
