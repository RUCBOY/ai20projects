In this paper we present the Interuniversity Research Center STEERING, formed in June 2017. The Research Center has been founded by three Italian Universities through five Departments. It represents the connection between Statistics and Engineering. The five Departments promoting it are the following: Department of Innovation and Information Engineering (Guglielmo Marconi University, Rome); Department of Statistics Computer Science Applications, Department of Information Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering (University of Florence); Department of Mechanical and Civil Engineering (University of Cassino and Lazio Meridionale). The potentiality of the Research Center and some of its aims are explained through three empirical case studies.
