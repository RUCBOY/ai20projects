To discuss the feasibility and accuracy of a specific computer-assisted individual drill guide template (CIDGT) for minimally invasive lumbar pedicle screw placement trajectory (MI-LPT) through a bovine cadaveric experimental study.
A 3-D reconstruction model, including lumbar vertebras (L1–L5), was generated, and the optimal MI-LPTs were determined. A drill guide template with a surface made of the antitemplate of the vertebral surface, including the spinous process and the entry point vertebral surface, was created by reverse engineering and rapid prototyping techniques. Then, MI-LPTs were determined by the drill guide templates, and the trajectories made by K-wires were observed by postoperative CT scan.
General Hospital of Shenyang Military Area Command of Chinese PLA.
In total, 150 K-wires for MI-LPTs were successfully inserted into L1-L5. The required mean time and fluoroscopy times between fixation of the template to the spinous process, entry point vertebral surface, and insertion of the K-wires for minimally invasive lumbar pedicle screw placement trajectories into each vertebra were 79.4 ± 15.0 s and 2.1 ± 0.8 times. There were no significant differences between the preoperative plan and postoperative assessment in the distance from the puncture to the midline and inclination angles according to the different levels (P > 0.05, respectively). The mean deviation between the preoperative plan and postoperative assessment in the distance from the puncture to the midline and inclination angles were 0.8 ± 0.5 mm and 0.9 ± 0.5°, respectively.
The potential use of the novel CIDGT, which was based on the unique morphology of the lumbar vertebra to place minimally invasive lumbar pedicle screws, is promising and could prevent too much radiation exposure intraoperatively.
