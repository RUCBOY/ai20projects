Falling from height accidents are a major cause of fatalities on construction sites. Despite a lot of research conducted on the enhancement of safety training and removal of hazardous areas, falling accidents remain a major threat for steeplejacks. According to NOISH FACE reports, 75.1% of the fall from height decedents didn't use the Personal Fall Arrest Systems (PFAS), which shows insufficient supervision of the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) by steeplejacks. Few scholars consider PFAS an important measure to prevent falls and the existing studies on PPE inspections showed that they were unsuitable for the scenarios faced by steeplejacks. This paper proposes an automated inspection method to check PPEs' usage by steeplejacks who are ready for aerial work beside exterior walls. An aerial operation scenario understanding method is proposed, which makes the inspection a preventative control measure and highly robust to noise. A deep-learning based occlusion mitigation method for PPE checking is introduced. We tested the performance of our method under various conditions and the experimental results demonstrate the reliability and robustness of our method to inspect falling prevention measures for steeplejacks and can help facilitate safety supervision.
