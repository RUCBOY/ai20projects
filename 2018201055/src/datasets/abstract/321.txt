Although scientometricians have focused on the strength of the citation impact of scientific publications, only a few have paid special attention to the width of the citation impact. In this article, we aim to understand the width by establishing our empirical study on a previously built structure, namely ego-centered citation networks (ECCNs). We remove the direct links to the focal publication and only retain the other edges in the network. Particularly, we examine the number and the size of the connected components of sub-networks of ECCNs in the whole Web of Science database. We find that the number and size of the connected components increase as the number of citations of publications rises, regardless of discipline, and that they are greater in recent publications than in older ones. We also observe that there are some differences in terms of the number/size of the connected components; particularly, the number/size of connected components for publications in Arts and Humanities is more “special” compared with other disciplines, and Natural Sciences tends to have greater values. These details are indicative in terms of the specializations of academia. Moreover, the findings have far-reaching implications on research assessment practices and literature searching.
