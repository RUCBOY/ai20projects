Brain–computer interface (BCI) is a new communication pathway for users with neurological deficiencies. The implementation of a BCI system requires complex electroencephalography (EEG) signal processing including filtering, feature extraction and classification algorithms. Most of current BCI systems are implemented on personal computers. Therefore, there is a great interest in implementing BCI on embedded platforms to meet system specifications in terms of time response, cost effectiveness, power consumption, and accuracy.
This article presents an embedded-BCI (EBCI) system based on a Stratix-IV field programmable gate array. The proposed system relays on the weighted overlap-add (WOLA) algorithm to perform dynamic filtering of EEG-signals by analyzing the event-related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS). The EEG-signals are classified, using the linear discriminant analysis algorithm, based on their spatial features.
The proposed system performs fast classification within a time delay of 0.430 s/trial, achieving an average accuracy of 76.80% according to an offline approach and 80.25% using our own recording. The estimated power consumption of the prototype is approximately 0.7 W.
Results show that the proposed EBCI system reduces the overall classification error rate for the three datasets of the BCI-competition by 5% compared to other similar implementations. Moreover, experiment shows that the proposed system maintains a high accuracy rate with a short processing time, a low power consumption, and a low cost.
Performing dynamic filtering of EEG-signals using WOLA increases the recognition rate of ERD/ERS patterns of motor imagery brain activity. This approach allows to develop a complete prototype of a EBCI system that achieves excellent accuracy rates.
