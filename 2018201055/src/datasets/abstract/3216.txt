Paper is devoted to the laser dieless drawing of the tubes made of magnesium alloy ZEK100. Important limitation of this process is a low ductility of magnesium alloys. The purpose of this work was the development and implementation into the FEM code, the ductility model of ZEK100 magnesium alloy and experimental validation of proposed methodology of process design. Ductility and flow stress models were developed based on tension and compression tests in temperature interval 20-350 Â°C. As result of this work, the technological diagrams for determination of diameter of tube after laser dieless drawing process were obtained.
