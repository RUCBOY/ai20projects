Multi-Agent Epistemic Logic has been investigated in Computer Science [Fagin, R., J. Halpern, Y. Moses and M. Vardi, “Reasoning about Knowledge,” MIT Press, USA, 1995] to represent and reason about agents or groups of agents knowledge and beliefs. Some extensions aimed to reasoning about knowledge and probabilities [Fagin, R. and J. Halpern, Reasoning about knowledge and probability, Journal of the ACM 41 (1994), pp. 340–367] and also with a fuzzy semantics have been proposed [Fitting, M., Many-valued modal logics, Fundam. Inform. 15 (1991), pp. 235–254; Maruyama, Y., Reasoning about fuzzy belief and common belief: With emphasis on incomparable beliefs, in: IJCAI 2011, Proceedings of the 22nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, July 16–22, 2011, 2011, pp. 1008–1013]. This paper introduces a parametric method to build graded epistemic logics inspired in the systematic method to build Multi-valued Dynamic Logics introduced in [Madeira, A., R. Neves and M. A. Martins, An exercise on the generation of many-valued dynamic logics, J. Log. Algebr. Meth. Program. 85 (2016), pp. 1011–1037. URL http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jlamp.2016.03.004; Madeira, A., R. Neves, M. A. Martins and L. S. Barbosa, A dynamic logic for every season, in: C. Braga and N. Martí-Oliet, editors, Formal Methods: Foundations and Applications – 17th Brazilian Symposium, SBMF 2014, Maceió, AL, Brazil, September 29-October 1, 2014. Proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8941 (2014), pp. 130–145. URL http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-15075-8_9]. The parameter in both methods is the same: an action lattice [Kozen, D., On action algebras, Logic and Information Flow (1994), pp. 78–88]. This algebraic structure supports a generic space of agent knowledge operators, as choice, composition and closure (as a Kleene algebra), but also a proper truth space for possible non bivalent interpretation of the assertions (as a residuated lattice).
