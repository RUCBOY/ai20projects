This research addresses the public’s understanding of the water cycle, and attempts to discover a new way of presenting the material. In this paper, we introduce “The Water-Cycle Ride,” a theme park-esque educational and entertainment ride. By incorporating high definition graphics, surround sound, a motion simulator, and an educational video from NASA-Ames, we introduce a new level of thrill to a subject most would not be interested in. Two riders, secured with a seatbelt and harness, can experience the ride together, which lasts about 3 minutes. Together they are taken through water’s three states: solid, liquid, and gas, and its hydrogeology on earth (runoff, groundwater, etc). At appropriate intervals we introduce g-forces so riders experience a rising feeling when evaporation is being explained, or a falling feeling when rain droplets are racing back to Earth. This paper outlines our novel methodology and results obtained, highlighting how a little thrill and excitement can be introduced to a normally passive subject.
