Humans comprehend a natural scene at a single glance; painters and other visual artists, through their abstract representations, stressed this capacity to the limit. The performance of computer vision solutions matched that of humans in many problems of visual recognition. In this paper we address the problem of recognizing the genre (subject) in digitized paintings using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as part of the more general dealing with abstract and/or artistic representation of scenes. Initially we establish the state of the art performance by training a CNN from scratch. In the next level of evaluation, we identify aspects that hinder the CNNs' recognition, such as artistic abstraction. Further, we test various domain adaptation methods that could enhance the subject recognition capabilities of the CNNs. The evaluation is performed on a database of 80,000 annotated digitized paintings, which is tentatively extended with artistic photographs, either original or stylized, in order to emulate artistic representations. Surprisingly, the most efficient domain adaptation is not the neural style transfer. Finally, the paper provides an experiment-based assessment of the abstraction level that CNNs are able to achieve.
