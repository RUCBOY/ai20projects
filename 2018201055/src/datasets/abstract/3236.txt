Image schemas and primary metaphors have been studied extensively in cognitive linguistics, but insufficiently in the applied context of human-computer interaction. Scant evidence proposes image schemas and primary metaphors as sources for intuitive interface design. Literature on concept formation, however, suggests that image schemas occurring earlier in infancy exert greater influence than later developed image schemas on the development of thought and language. To investigate the impact of developmental origin of image schemas on the validity of image-schematic metaphors in supporting intuitive interface design, two studies analyzed metaphor strengths of image schemas from questionnaire, and from gesture and touch interaction with a 2D interactive interface. Responses linked to primary metaphors associated with early image schemas demonstrated greater agreement rates compared to late image schemas. Whilst questionnaire and touch responses generally demonstrated metaphor strengths well above chance level, gesture responses were only above chance level for early but not for late image schemas. For the application of image-schematic metaphors in intuitive interfaces, the current findings suggest two restrictions: First, primary metaphors linked to early image schemas appear to be more intuitive than those linked to late image schemas. This impact of developmental occurrence of image schemas is interpreted in terms of differences in complexity and frequency. Second, image-schematic primary metaphors appear more suited for providing intuitive touch interaction experiences. For intuitive gesture interaction experiences, they appear less suited.
