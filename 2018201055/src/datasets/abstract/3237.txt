Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems for the detection of lung disorders play an important role in clinical decision making. CAD systems provide a second opinion to the physician in interpreting computed tomography (CT) images. In this work, a CAD system to diagnose pulmonary hamartoma nodules from chest CT images is proposed.
Segmentation of lung parenchyma from CT images is carried out using Otsuâ€™s thresholding method. Nodules are considered to be the region of interests (ROIs) in this work. Texture, shape and run length based features are extracted from the ROIs. Cosine similarity measure (CSM) and rough dependency measure (RDM) are used independently as filter evaluation functions with ant colony optimization (ACO) to select two subsets of features. The selected subsets are used to train two classifiers namely support vector machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers using 10-fold cross validation. All the four trained classifiers are tested and the performance measures are estimated.
CT slices of patients affected with pulmonary cancer and hamartoma are used for experimentation. From the lung parenchymal tissues of 300 CT slices, 390 nodules are extracted. The feature selection algorithms, ACO-CSM and ACO-RDM are run for different feature subset sizes. The selected features are used to train SVM and NB classifiers. From the results obtained, it is inferred that SVM classifier with the feature subsets chosen by ACO-RDM feature selection approach yielded a maximum classification accuracy of 94.36% with 38 features.
From the results, it can be clearly inferred that selecting relevant features to train the classifier has a definite impact on the performance of the classifier.
