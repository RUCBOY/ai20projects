Orthopedic braces made by Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing and numerical simulation were shown to improve spinal deformities correction in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis while using less material. Simulations with BraceSim (Rodin4D, Groupe Lagarrigue, Bordeaux, France) require a sagittal radiograph, not always available. The objective was to develop an innovative modeling method based on a single coronal radiograph and surface topography, and assess the effectiveness of braces designed with this approach.
With a patient coronal radiograph and a surface topography, the developed method allowed the 3D reconstruction of the spine, rib cage and pelvis using geometric models from a database and a free form deformation technique. The resulting 3D reconstruction converted into a finite element model was used to design and simulate the correction of a brace. The developed method was tested with data from ten scoliosis cases. The simulated correction was compared to analogous simulations performed with a 3D reconstruction built using two radiographs and surface topography (validated gold standard reference).
There was an average difference of 1.4°/1.7° for the thoracic/lumbar Cobb angle, and 2.6°/5.5° for the kyphosis/lordosis between the developed reconstruction method and the reference. The average difference of the simulated correction was 2.8°/2.4° for the thoracic/lumbar Cobb angles and 3.5°/5.4° the kyphosis/lordosis.
This study showed the feasibility to design and simulate brace corrections based on a new modeling method with a single coronal radiograph and surface topography. This innovative method could be used to improve brace designs, at a lesser radiation dose for the patient.
