This survey paper attempts to study the existence, importance and impact of the notion of context in modern humanistic computing. Given its inherent diversity, the term is nowadays widely acknowledged among computer science tasks and has become a major topic of interest in several of its sub-fields, ranging from contextual semantics to social networks, social media and recently emerged innovative applications, such as travel routing. We start by presenting a brief review of contextual semantics as nowadays they are considered suitable for most common content analysis problems. Focus is also given within the next survey sections on the impact of context within the social networks and media field that came into sight over the last years. A short, closing discussion on the identified challenges and potential future research directions concludes this survey.
