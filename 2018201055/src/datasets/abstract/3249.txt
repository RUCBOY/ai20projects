The human-computer relationship is often convoluted and despite decades of progress, many relationships relating to continued use are unclear and poorly defined. This may be due to a lack of interdisciplinary collaboration, especially from a theoretical standpoint between computer science and psychology. Following a review of existing theories that attempt to explain continued technology use, we developed the Technology Integration Model (TIM). In sum, the main objective of TIM is to outline the processes behind continued technology use in an individual's everyday life. Here we present the model alongside a description of its scope and the relationships between constructs. This can help generate research questions relating to technology use while simultaneously addressing many previous shortcomings of existing models. As a unifying theory, TIM can quickly be adopted by researchers and developers when designing and implementing new technologies.
