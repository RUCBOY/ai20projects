Through a survey and analysis of the available literature, this paper briefly depicts the background of the development of Industry 4.0 (i.e., Smart Manufacturing) and corresponding industry development policies of various major countries. A smart manufacturing key technology architecture is proposed to classify nineteen key technologies as belonging to a sensor layer, an integration layer, an intelligent layer or a response layer. A technology roadmap is developed as the framework and key technologies are defined through expert interviews which provide insight into Taiwan's current status of smart manufacturing, including market maturity, technology maturity and correlation of key technologies, and these correlation results are organized in a correlation matrix. Suggestions for future Taiwan smart manufacturing industry development were also solicited from experts. Based on the results, this paper proposes a prediction of Smart Manufacturing domain technology and market maturity as well as emerging technology development trends. Based on this analysis of smart manufacturing domain technology and market trends, the results provide a foundation for industry and researchers to understand the development trends for key smart manufacturing technologies, and for policy formulation to support industry development.
