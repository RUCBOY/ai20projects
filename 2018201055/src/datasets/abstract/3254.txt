The research of the quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensors can provide an effective, real-time, point-of-care testing-detection technology for the usage in the areas of clinical and laboratory research, drug screening, and bacteria testing, among others. This article describes the designing and structure of a real-time simulation of a LabVIEW software and the QCMD board for measuring the dissipation factor and frequency. The QCM with the dissipation-measuring function was designed and programmed, and it settles the oscillator with the QCMD board while the LabVIEW controller devises the ports. The dissipation factor of the QCM was determined from the time and the switch on/off settings programmed of the oscillation signal decreasing after the oscillator was signal falling edge. The system was also applied to detect values like the blood coagulation and Gl content in the DI water. By using the QCMD technique, one can analyze the online detection of the binding between a specific antibody and bacteria by two parameters: the quartz-crystal frequency (f) and dissipation (D).
