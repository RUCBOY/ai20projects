As a fundamental subject of theoretical computer science, the maximum independent set (MIS) problem not only is of purely theoretical interest, but also has found wide applications in various fields. However, for a general graph determining the size of a MIS is NP-hard, and exact computation of the number of all MISs is even more difficult. It is thus of significant interest to seek special graphs for which the MIS problem can be exactly solved. In this paper, we address the MIS problem in the pseudofractal scale-free web and the Sierpiński gasket, which have the same number of vertices and edges. For both graphs, we determine exactly the independence number and the number of all possible MISs. The independence number of the pseudofractal scale-free web is as twice as the one of the Sierpiński gasket. Moreover, the pseudofractal scale-free web has a unique MIS, while the number of MISs in the Sierpiński gasket grows exponentially with the number of vertices.
