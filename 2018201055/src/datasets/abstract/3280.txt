This paper is written in honor of my long term friend and mentor Professor Bernard Roth who spent over six decades in Academic contributions devoted to Kinematics, Dynamics, Control, and design of computer controlled mechanical devices. He is continuing actively in his work from the famous school Hasso Plattner Institute of Design cofounded at Stanford (popularly known as d.school). As an Academic Director he is active in Creativity in Design. This paper explores the idea of Creativity directly from Science of 17thâ€“18th centuries in place of Engineering evolved by Professor Timoshenko at Stanford in early 20th century at the time of rapid expansion of rotating machinery from de Laval in 1882. An example of design that involves extreme temperature ranges, magneto hydrodynamics and optimization in a fusion reactor to produce tritium fuel will be described.
