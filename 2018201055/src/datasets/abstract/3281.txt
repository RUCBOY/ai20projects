The Cayley transform for orthogonal groups is a well known construction with applications in real and complex analysis, linear algebra and computer science. In this work, we construct Cayley transforms on Stiefel manifolds. Applications to the Lusternikâ€“Schnirelmann category and optimization problems are presented.
