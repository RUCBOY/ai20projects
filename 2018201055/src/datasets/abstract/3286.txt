This work reports a computational study, focused on graphene (G) and graphene oxide (GO) interfaces with titanium dioxide (TiO2), and an experimental assay on the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/G and TiO2/GO nanocomposites in the degradation of two different pollutants: methylene blue and ciprofloxacin. Both carbon nanostructures were compared due to their different chemical structure: GO is a G derivative with oxygen functional groups which should promote a closer chemical interaction with TiO2 nanoparticles. Computational models of the fundamental properties of the composites indicated potentially improved photocatalytic activity compared to TiO2, namely lower band gaps and charge carrier segregation at the interfaces. These fundamental properties match qualitatively experimental results on methylene blue, which was more effectively degraded by TiO2/G and TiO2/GO nanocomposites than by pure TiO2 under UV light. In contrast, the same nanocomposites were found to be less efficient to degrade ciprofloxacin than pure TiO2 under visible and UV light. Therefore, this work showcases the relevance of an efficient matching between the catalyst and the molecular properties and structure of the pollutant.
