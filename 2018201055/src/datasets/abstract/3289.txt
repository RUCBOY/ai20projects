This paper is about the performance analysis and control issues for discrete event systems (DESs) including time specifications and modeled with time Petri nets (TPNs). Petri nets are known as efficient mathematical and graphical models that are widely used to describe distributed DESs including choices, synchronizations and parallelisms. The domains of application include but are not restricted to manufacturing systems, computer science and transportation networks. Incorporating the time in the model is important to consider many control problems. This paper proposes an algorithm to design in a systematic way exact approximated timed reachability graphs that encode all feasible timed trajectories at a given accuracy under earliest firing policy. Some applications of these graphs are discussed.
