In order to satisfy the demands for both safety and global warming reduction, a high-strength seismic reinforced steel bar is required in the structural steel market. Recent developments in computational thermodynamics and related application software have made it possible to design a suitable material as well as support engineers of steel manufacturing companies in the production of the designed material with minimum benchmarks in practical operations. This paper reports our recent success in developing grade 600 MPa reinforced steel bars for seismic safety in South Korea. First, conventional alloy design based on CALPHAD-type computational thermodynamics was carried out. For this purpose, a typical alloy system of Fe-0.30C-0.23Si-1.37Mn-0.14V-0.22Cu (in wt%) was selected, and thermodynamic and kinetic calculations were carried out using MatCalc and JMatPro software. Second, in order to reduce V content in the steel for economic reasons, a cooling process designed using finite element (FE) simulation based on the thermodynamic database was performed. For this application, Fe-0.34C-0.22Si-1.34Mn-0.04 V (in wt%) alloy was chosen, and the FE software ABAQUS was applied for modeling the TempCore process. The mechanical properties of the steel products with a diameter of 32 mm produced based on the simulated results satisfy the required properties for grade 600 MPa seismic reinforced steel bars.
