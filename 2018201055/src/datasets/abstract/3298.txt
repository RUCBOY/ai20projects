By the results of theoretical-experimental research is approved that the drag resistance of the groundwork vehicles mainly depends on the state of cultivated environment, properties, structural parameters of working organ and kinematic regime of system [1].
Increasing soil specific resistance results in serious obstacles of the work of the working organ and deterioration of the technological process.
For modeling the interaction between the soil and the working organs have been studied computerized automated design possibilities. Comparison of soil tension and deformation values by SOLIDWORKS software tool allows you to conclude that the 3-fold increase in the angle of the wedge blade to a 24% increase in soil strain and the vertical deformation doubles. Simultaneously, during the design of the working organs, it is possible to obtain functional connections between different parameters, observing the essence of these connections and improving the structure of the working organ.
