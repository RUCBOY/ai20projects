The research here presented aims at developing a new, promising method for the imaging diagnostics of breast lesions â€“ ultrasound tomography (UST). A currently implemented device enables the reconstruction three complementary images for each coronal breast section. Based on in vivo breast examination, the authors developed an approach to breast diagnostics which employs ultrasound transmission and reflection tomography imaging. The obtained transmission images of ultrasound speed distribution show good correlation of glandular tissue areas with their visualization on MRI images. The results also allow a prediction that the implemented UST device offering fusion of reconstructed images may contribute to achieving a new standard for breast cancer diagnostics through non-invasive, fast and cheap screening tests.
