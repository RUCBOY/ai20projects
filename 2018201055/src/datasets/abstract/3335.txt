Computer simulations were carried out to study the origin of the different metal segregation showed by bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized in microemulsions. Our hypothesis is that the kinetics of nanoparticle formation in microemulsions has to be considered on terms of two potentially limiting factors, chemical reaction itself and the rate of reactants exchange between micelles. From the kinetic study it is deduced that chemical reduction in microemulsions is a pseudo first-order process, but not from the beginning. At the initial stage of the synthesis, redistribution of reactants between micelles is controlled by the intermicellar exchange rate, meanwhile the core and middle layers are being built. This exchange control has a different impact depending on the reduction rate of the particular metal in relation to the intermicellar exchange rate. For the case of Au/Pt nanoparticles, the kinetic constant of Au (fast reduction) is strongly dependent on intermicellar exchange rate and reactant concentration. On the contrary, the kinetic constant of Pt (slower reduction) remains constant. Therefore, the fact that the reaction takes place in a microemulsion affects more or less depending on the reduction rate of the metals. As a consequence, the final nanostructure not only depends on difference between the reduction rates of both metals, but also on the reduction rate of each metal in relation to the intermicellar exchange rate.
