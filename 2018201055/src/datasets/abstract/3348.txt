Ten order all-pole model is used in the 2400 bit/second mixed excitation linear prediction to describe human vocal tract. Traditional Levinson-Durbin algorithm is one of the methods to solve the Yule-Walker equations conducted by the ten order linear prediction model. Taking the iteration step of traditional Levinson-Durbin algorithm as 1, an extended algorithm with any positive integer iteration step which is no larger than the order of Teoplitz matrix is proposed. The extended algorithm considers interaction between the adjacent subtracts. A hybrid algorithm of the extended algorithm and traditional algorithm has been applied to solve the 2400 bit/second mixed excitation linear prediction under some conditions. The perceptual evaluation of speech quality mean opinion score of nasal syllable is improved in some degree.
