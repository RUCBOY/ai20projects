The natural instinct of human beings is very complex. The understanding of this instinct requires a clear dimensional analysis of the knowledge of discourse. The computer systems are now trained to understand how things work in real-world domain for intelligent analysis. This effort although very progressive has a limitation. There is an intelligence gap which makes human one step above the machine. Fuzzy logic can be used to make a machine understand this intelligence gap in a better way. Fuzzy logic is the science which makes a computer understand and think the way humans do. The aim of this study is two folds: first, to understand fuzzy logic, a computational Intelligence technique, for effective decision making and second, to illustrate through real world examples the existence of this intelligence gap using well known natural language processing applications like Google Search Engine, Google Translator and MIT Start. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work available in the literature which exemplifies this intelligence gap in such a simple manner. The examples are chosen carefully to illustrate and demonstrate the applications of fuzzy logic in natural language processing environment for every reader.
