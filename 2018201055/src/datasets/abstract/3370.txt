The development of human-like artificial intelligence has been a goal of computer scientists since the 1950s. Recent technological developments have led to an increased interest in the discourse on human-robot interactions, as robots equipped with artificial intelligence are expected to take a more prominent role in society. This article links insights from psychology and consumer behavior with recent developments in human-robot interactions.
