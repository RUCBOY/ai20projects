The objective of this research is to shed light on the applicability of the Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Approach to the concept of control chains for the combined analysis of safety and security of SCADA systems and, more generally, to computer systems used in automation, including functional safety and security standards. The paper discusses the concept of control chains, presents an overview of the NFR Approach, and applies this approach to the safety and security analysis of control chains in a case study of the automatic control of the hydrocarbon tank pressure control system.
