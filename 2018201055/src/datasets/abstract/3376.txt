Community detection in large networks has been a focus of recent research in many of fields, including biology, physics, social sciences, and computer science. Most community detection methods partition the entire network into communities, groups of nodes that have many connections within communities and few connections between them and do not identify different roles that nodes can have in communities. We propose a community detection model that integrates more different measures that can fast identify communities of different sizes and densities. We use node degree centrality, strong similarity with one node from community, maximal similarity of node to community, compactness of communities and separation between communities. Each measure has its own strength and weakness. Thus, combining different measures can benefit from the strengths of each one and eliminate encountered problems of using an individual measure. We present a fast local expansion algorithm for uncovering communities of different sizes and densities and reveals rich information on input networks. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is better or as effective as the other community detection algorithms for both real-world and synthetic networks while it requires less time.
