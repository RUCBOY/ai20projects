Disciplinary layout is of great significance for research institutes, which can show the tendency and emphasis of the research institutes and facilitate mutual learning and promote potential collaboration. In this study, we illustrate how to use hierarchical clustering method to cluster the research institutes of Chinese Academy of Sciences based on the paper data which embody the disciplinary layouts. Based upon the clustering methods, potential collaborators can be identified and unified administrative plans can be developed which are of great significance in the development of scientific institutes.
