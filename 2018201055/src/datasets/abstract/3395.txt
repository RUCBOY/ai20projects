The steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signal is widely utilized for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) that enable a direct communication between a user and an external device. Most devices in high-bit-rate SSVEP-based BCI, however, are lab-oriented and expensive, and thus not suitable for personal use in daily life. In this paper, we aim to investigate the feasibility of implementing high-bit-rate BCI using consumer-grade portable devices. We utilize a portable EEG headset to capture brain activities and extract user×³s intention from the weak and noisy signal through an optimization framework. We investigate several important factors that affect the bit rate and finally maximize the bit rate with the best choices of these factors. We can achieve 54.8 bits/min on a normal computer monitor, which is comparable to the result with expensive devices, and 17.3 bits/min on a smartphone screen, which is the first work of such on a smartphone screen. Our work can be easily integrated into security application such as defending against shoulder-surfing attacks, and assist patients with reduced motor abilities as well.
