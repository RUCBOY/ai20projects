The goal of the paper is to improve the recognition of the human hand postures in a Human Computer Interaction application, the reducing of the time computing and to improve the user comfort regarding the used human hand postures. The authors developed an application for computer mouse control. The application based on the proposed algorithm, hand pad color and on the selected hand feature presents good behavior regarding the time computing. The user has an increased comfort in use of the system due to the proposed hand postures. Also, the system works well having the same behavior under very low illuminance level and high illuminance level.
