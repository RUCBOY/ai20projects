This study assessed several precursors that might be connected to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) practices enacted in classrooms, namely, science teachers' conception of traditional versus constructivist teaching and learning, their sense of efficacy, ICT efficacy, and ICT professional development. Data were gathered from 303 science teachers. According to the results, constructivist conceptions exerted moderate effects on the teachers' sense of efficacy constructs, which in turn increased their ICT efficacy. Additional results pointed to the positive mediation role of teachers' ICT professional development in linking their ICT efficacy to ICT use for constructivist activities in their science classroom.
