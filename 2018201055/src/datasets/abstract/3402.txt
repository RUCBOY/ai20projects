This bibliometric analysis explores the interdisciplinary characteristics of library and information science (LIS) from the perspective of interdisciplinary LIS authors. Articles published in non-LIS journals by LIS authors between 2005 and 2014 and indexed by the Web of Science database formed the basis for analysis. The results showed that interdisciplinary LIS authors published articles in numerous disciplines; a largest number of articles were found in medical and music journals. Over half of the articles published by these authors were not LIS-related and were primarily singly-authored articles and articles coauthored by LIS and non-LIS authors. Most articles coauthored by only LIS authors involved LIS-related topics. Interdisciplinary LIS authors preferred to publish by themselves. The majority of interdisciplinary authors were academic librarians. Interdisciplinary LIS authors most frequently collaborated with other LIS authors, followed by authors from the field of medicine. Although interdisciplinary LIS authors are a minority, they are active in expanding the visibility of LIS.
