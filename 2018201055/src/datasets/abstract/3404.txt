The Long Term Evolution (LTE) network is a very much popular network in heterogeneous network. Heterogeneous networks provide maximum data rate by integrating various technologies and channels, based on appropriate network selection. For the sensible data transmission in the LTE network, noise plays an vital role as channel is a free space. The minimum noise channel selection is a decision of present and previous status of network channel. Proposed scheme develop neural network model, which will act as a smart link generation scheme for computing minimum noise channel path for sensible data transmission. Hence, proposed scheme will improve performance of the network. Result indicates that, proposed scheme improves throughput and system reliability. Proposed scheme is also reduces packet loss rate and energy consumption in contrast with conventional techniques.
