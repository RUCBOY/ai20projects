A lot of researches are going on since last two decades for object recognition, shape matching, and pattern recognition in the field of computer vision. Face recognition is one of the important issues in object recognition and computer vision. In our day to day activities, a number of biometric applications are available for recognizing humans such as eye or iris recognition, fingerprint recognition, face recognition. Face is an important part of human being and requires detection for different applications such as security, forensic investigation. It requires proper techniques for face detection and recognition with challenges of different facial expressions, pose variations, occlusion, aging and resolution either in the frame of stationary object or video sequencing images. Authors tried to put the concept of face synthesis, for improving accuracy and recognition rate on different face database like ORL, YALE, AR and LFW. Authors had presented a critical review of various types of face recognition techniques and challenges, to improve efficiency and recognition rate for identifying face images in large database, with comparison of accuracy or recognition rate.
