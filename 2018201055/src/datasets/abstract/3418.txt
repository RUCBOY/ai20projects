Security plays an important role in various computer and network applications. Random number generator is a critical component for different cryptographic systems including key generation, unique identification, cookie generation etc. Recently, many architectures using memristor have been proposed for different computing and storage applications. It is observed that memristor based design possesses better randomness. This paper evaluates various memristor based random number generator structures and proposed a new architecture which meets the NIST standards for random number. It is shown that the proposed architecture is cost effective and low power consuming.
