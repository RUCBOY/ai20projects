With the fast development of information science and technology, the increasing demand for computer data processing caused a rapid growth in central processing unit (CPU) of high power capacity. CPU Cooling plays an important role in guaranteeing reliable working conditions with proper temperature for IT equipment, rack servers and related devices. In this paper, a novel kind of heat sink filled with porous copper is proposed and experiment is conducted to investigate its cooling effect for CPU. The results show that cooling capacity of porous copper increases with increasing inlet and outlet pressure difference, while it almost remains the same with heat flux variations. Moreover, the CPU surface temperatures of two different heat sinks are compared. It indicates that the heat sink coefficient of porous copper increases by 28.5 % and the surface temperature decreases by more than 10 oC, compared to traditional CPU heat sink with micro channels. This work is important for CPU cooling system design and optimization in practical applications.
