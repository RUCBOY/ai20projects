The TensorD toolbox is a Python tensor library built on TensorFlow. It provides tensor decomposition methods as well as basic tensor operations. In addition, other features of TensorD include GPU compatibility, high modularity of structure, and open source. It facilitate the practice of tensor methods in computer vision, deep learning and other related research fields. The TensorD toolbox is available at https://github.com/Large-Scale-Tensor-Decomposition/tensorD.
