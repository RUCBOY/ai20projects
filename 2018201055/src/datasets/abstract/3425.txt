Information technology is an important aspect of human life that has provided comfort and ease in communicating. The most used communication technologies today is the smartphone, which is a mobile phone with the ability of a portable computer. Currently, to communicate each other, people feel more convenience using chat application in a smartphone than calling or short message services (SMS) features. Some of the advantages of chat application are there is no message size limitations, highest number of consumers use it; especially younger demographics,and it also works on mobile web without application download. Due to the convenience of communication using chat apps increases, the security demands are also higher, i.e., a proper cryptography scheme is needed to protect the messages. In this paper, we implement ECC algorithm to secure text message in messaging application of a smartphone. We will adopt the method proposed by Singh1 to create a chat application in Android program that equipped end-to-end encryption. We also give the experimental result of our chat apps performance such as the accuracy of the received text message, average encryption and decryption time.
