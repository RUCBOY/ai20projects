This paper avails an in-depth analysis of the field of crowdsourcing and its impacts when used in the world of machine learning. It comprises of various contributions that crowdsourcing can make to improvise the techniques that employ machine learning like â€“ producing data, debugging and checking of models, hybrid smart machines to reduce the human intervention required to facilitate high quality performance by artificial intelligence and developmental experimentation to improve human-computer interaction. A discussion regarding the nature of crowd-workers follows next which focuses on various factors like their reaction to different forms of motivation, their behaviour towards each other and deceit among them. The takeaways of this paper include a few tips and routines to be followed to achieve success through crowdsourcing.
