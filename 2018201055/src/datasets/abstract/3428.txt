This research proposes a dynamic game balancing by using Facial Expression Recognition to enhance the player’s experience when playing the game. Research has shown that players generally express their emotions when playing the game. This allow us to capture the player’s expression from their face and use it to dynamically adjust the game difficulties. A preliminary study was conducted to capture what kind of game that would be suitable to test dynamic balancing. The game with a dynamic balancing system then was developed using Scrum methodology as the software development methodology. Furthermore, the dynamic balancing in the game was simulated in the computer and evaluated, with some of items from Immersive Experience Questionnaire, with players played two versions of game, one with dynamic balancing activated and the other with-out dynamic balancing activated. The results evidently show that there was some statistically significant enhancement in the game with Facial Expression Recognition activated as a game dynamic game balancing compare to the one with-out Facial Expression Recognition.
