Wearable sensors and social networking platforms play a key role in providing a new method to collect patient data for efficient healthcare monitoring. However, continuous patient monitoring using wearable sensors generates a large amount of healthcare data. In addition, the user-generated healthcare data on social networking sites come in large volumes and are unstructured. The existing healthcare monitoring systems are not efficient at extracting valuable information from sensors and social networking data, and they have difficulty analyzing it effectively. On top of that, the traditional machine learning approaches are not enough to process healthcare big data for abnormality prediction. Therefore, a novel healthcare monitoring framework based on the cloud environment and a big data analytics engine is proposed to precisely store and analyze healthcare data, and to improve the classification accuracy. The proposed big data analytics engine is based on data mining techniques, ontologies, and bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM). Data mining techniques efficiently preprocess the healthcare data and reduce the dimensionality of the data. The proposed ontologies provide semantic knowledge about entities and aspects, and their relations in the domains of diabetes and blood pressure (BP). Bi-LSTM correctly classifies the healthcare data to predict drug side effects and abnormal conditions in patients. Also, the proposed system classifies the patients’ health condition using their healthcare data related to diabetes, BP, mental health, and drug reviews. This framework is developed employing the Protégé Web Ontology Language tool with Java. The results show that the proposed model precisely handles heterogeneous data and improves the accuracy of health condition classification and drug side effect predictions.
