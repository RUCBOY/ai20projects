There has been an increased focus on the use of cognitive strategies in the science classroom, in part this increased focus is due to the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This focus has created the need to examine claims regarding the cognitive basis for disciplinary approaches such as video lecture, virtual reality (VR), Serious Educational Games (SEGs), and hands on activities. The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in the level of hemodynamic response as it relates to four different approaches to teaching topics in the life sciences. The first approach used a video based lecture approach. The other approaches used an immersive Serious Educational Game and a virtual reality environment in which students were exposed to an experience involving the process of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) replication. The final condition was that of a hands-on activity. Researchers used functional near-infrared spectroscopy to examine hemodynamic localization and intensity as it related to each condition. In addition to examination of cognitive dynamics, content learning gains were also examined. Results provide evidence that there is parity between the hands on condition, Serious Educational Games, and the virtual reality conditions in learning outcomes and cognitive processing.
