Data science is a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development, and technology in order to solve analytically complex problems. Sustainability is a critical asset of a manufacturing enterprise. It enables a business to differentiate itself from competitors and to compete efficiently and effectively to the best of its ability. This paper is a review of data analytics, and how it supports advanced manufacturing with an emphasis on sustainability. The objective is to present a context for a roadmap for applied data science addressing such analytic challenges. We start with a general introduction to advanced manufacturing and trends in modern analytics tools and technology. We then list challenges of analytics supporting advanced manufacturing and sustainability aspects. The information quality (InfoQ) framework is proposed as a backbone to evaluate the analytics needed in advanced manufacturing. The eight InfoQ dimensions are: 1) Data Resolution, 2) Data Structure, 3) Data Integration, 4) Temporal Relevance, 5) Chronology of Data and Goal, 6) Generalizability, 7) Operationalization and 8) Communication. These dimensions provide a classification of advanced manufacturing analytics domains. The paper provides a roadmap for the development of applied analytic techniques supporting advanced manufacturing and sustainability. The objective is to motivate researchers, practitioners and industrialists to support such a roadmap.
