The ubiquitous and wide applications like scene understanding, video surveillance, robotics, and self-driving systems triggered vast research in the domain of computer vision in the most recent decade. Being the core of all these applications, visual recognition systems which encompasses image classification, localization and detection have achieved great research momentum. Due to significant development in neural networks especially deep learning, these visual recognition systems have attained remarkable performance. Object detection is one of these domains witnessing great success in computer vision. This paper demystifies the role of deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural network for object detection. Deep learning frameworks and services available for object detection are also enunciated. Deep learning techniques for state-of-the-art object detection systems are assessed in this paper.
