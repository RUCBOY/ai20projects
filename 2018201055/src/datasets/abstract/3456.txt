In most cases, the movement of wheelchairs is controlled by disabled people using a joystick or by an accompanying person. Significantly disabled patients need alternative control methods without using the wheelchair joystick because it is undesirable or impossible for these patients. In this article, we present the implementation of a robotic wheelchair based on a powered wheelchair that is controlled not by the joystick but by the onboard computer that receives and processes data from the extended brain-computer interface (extended BCI). Under this term we understand the robotic complex control system with simultaneous independent alternative control channels. In this robotic wheelchair version the BCI works with voice and gesture control channels.
