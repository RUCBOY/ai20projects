Augmented Reality overlays virtual objects on the real world in real-time and has the potential to enhance education, however, few AR training systems provide personalised learning support. Combining AR with intelligent tutoring systems has the potential to improve training outcomes by providing personalised learner support, such as feedback on the AR environment. This paper reviews the current state of AR training systems combined with ITSs and proposes a series of requirements for combining the two paradigms. In addition, this paper identifies a growing need to provide more research in the context of design and implementation of adaptive augmented reality tutors (ARATs). These include possibilities of evaluating the user interfaces of ARAT and potential domains where an ARAT might be considered effective.
