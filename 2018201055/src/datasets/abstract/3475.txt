With the development of quantum computer, making the traditional cloud storage program data integrity verification protocol is no longer safe anymore, so how to establish a safe and efficient, cost-effective cloud storage system becomes the industry's research hotspot. This paper makes improvements on the basis of the previous schemes. On the cloud storage model, we focus on the protection of user data privacy, and send the file and user signature to CSP and TPA respectively, so these methods will improve the privacy of signature information. In the cloud storage data calculation, using of lattice and Bloom filter methods, can not only resist the quantum computer attacks, but also based on the realization of dynamic integrity, improving the utilization of cloud storage space ultimately.
