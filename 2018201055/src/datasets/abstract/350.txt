With the development of blockchain-based digital currencies, the security of digital wallets becomes more and more important. As far as we know, there is no safe lightweight wallet in hyperledger fabric. To solve the problem, we proposed a Trustzone-based Secure Lightweight Wallet for Hyperledger Fabric (hereafter referred to as TSLWHF). Firstly, we designed an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) set of transactions under blockchain and a signature verification mechanism for transactions, which made it possible to implement the lightweight wallet in hyperledger fabric. Then, we implemented a reliable protection mechanism for private keys and wallet’s address, which solved the problem that users’ information might be stolen or replaced. Meanwhile, the transaction verification results are guaranteed not to be tampered by hackers through verifying transactions in Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and encrypting local block headers. Finally, to demonstrate utility, we deployed the system in hyperledger fabric and trustzone. Experiments showed that the wallet reduces the size of locally stored data while protecting the security of user’s assets. The time spent on TSLWHF to execute a transaction is 0.589s, which improves transaction’s performance compared to Bitcoin wallet.
