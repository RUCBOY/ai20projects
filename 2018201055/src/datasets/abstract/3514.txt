Lung cancer is one of the dangerous and life taking disease in the world. However, early diagnosis and treatment can save life. Although, CT scan imaging is best imaging technique in medical field, it is difficult for doctors to interpret and identify the cancer from CT scan images. Therefore computer aided diagnosis can be helpful for doctors to identify the cancerous cells accurately. Many computer aided techniques using image processing and machine learning has been researched and implemented. The main aim of this research is to evaluate the various computer-aided techniques, analyzing the current best technique and finding out their limitation and drawbacks and finally proposing the new model with improvements in the current best model. The method used was that lung cancer detection techniques were sorted and listed on the basis of their detection accuracy. The techniques were analyzed on each step and overall limitation, drawbacks were pointed out. It is found that some has low accuracy and some has higher accuracy but not nearer to 100%. Therefore, our research targets to increase the accuracy towards 100%.
