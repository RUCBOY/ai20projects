Crowed is a large gathering of people, mostly in unorganized manner. The conventional crowd interaction systems for opinion acceptability is driven from the retrieval mechanisms of the crowd data using Verbal or Non-verbal means. The Verbal communication from the crowd leads to chaotic situation where the chances of data loss is quite higher with no privacy. The non-verbal interaction leads to a more efficient method of data retrieval as it bounds the unwanted noise and provides better security measures to the system. In this work it is proposed a BYOD[1] supported non verbal crowd interaction framework that can provide an instant user feedback in situations like public speking, live concert or class room teaching learning. The userâ€™s own device interface prompts with a quick response code[23], that work as a transient identity and an intermediary optical link for exchanging responses. The proposed system also effective for mobile supported pervasive data exchange with optical marker as trigger and security. The experiments and anecdotal results depicts a higher level of user satisfaction that paves a way for furthermore technology driven enhancements in the cost effective crowd interaction systems.
