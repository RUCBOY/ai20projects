A semi-physiological two compartment pharmacokinetic model with two active metabolites (primary (PM) and secondary metabolites (SM)) with saturable and non-saturable pre-systemic efflux transporter, intestinal and hepatic metabolism has been developed. The aim of this work is to explore in several scenarios which analyte (parent drug or any of the metabolites) is the most sensitive to changes in drug product performance (i.e. differences in in vivo dissolution) and to make recommendations based on the simulations outcome. A total of 128 scenarios (2 Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) drug types, 2 levels of KM Pgp, in 4 metabolic scenarios at 2 dose levels in 4 quality levels of the drug product) were simulated for BCS class II and IV drugs. Monte Carlo simulations of all bioequivalence studies were performed in NONMEM 7.3. Results showed the parent drug (PD) was the most sensitive analyte for bioequivalence trials in all the studied scenarios. PM and SM revealed less or the same sensitivity to detect differences in pharmaceutical quality as the PD. Another relevant result is that mean point estimate of Cmax and AUC methodology from Monte Carlo simulations allows to select more accurately the most sensitive analyte compared to the criterion on the percentage of failed or successful BE studies, even for metabolites which frequently show greater variability than PD.
