The use of mobile network traffic is increasing due to the development of communication devices such as smart phones. Data traffic accounts for more than voice traffic. Video traffic accounts for the largest proportion of mobile data traffic and this proportion is increasing. However, various mobile environments affect the status of the mobile network and limit the provision of video services using the Internet. Therefore, a method for improving the quality of experience (QoE) of a video service in mobile environments is required. This paper presents a traffic management method using the mobile edge cloud. The mobile edge cloud is placed in the mobile edge network and monitors the status of mobile terminals. Through the mobile edge cloud, it becomes possible to effectively manage the traffic of mobile terminals by the network. The proposed method manages video traffic from the content server on the Internet according to the edge network status and mobility of a mobile terminal, and provides video traffic to mobile terminals. This method, using the mobile edge cloud, leads to improvement of the QoE for mobile video users. The superiority of this method compared to currently available systems was validated by computer simulation.
