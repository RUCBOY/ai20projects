This paper aims to enlighten on digital design. Specific concentration is made on designing objects using shape control. It plays a significant role in modelling objects to desired level. The paper focuses on spline methods and affiliate research in the area. It aims to provide the audience with a variety of designing techniques, applications and examples necessary for various real life problems. To be very specific, a very generalized kind of continuity has been introduced between cubic polynomial pieces to generate a cubic spline which can produce a variety of shape control. It can design and model objects in real life in a well-controlled way. Shape control, in the objects, is a choice for the use. It can be interactive or can be automated.
