With an ever increasing need for products with better surface finish and exceptional dimensional accuracies, CNC machines have become an integral part of all manufacturing processes. Hence CNC programming has been an integral part of engineering education. In this scenario it only seems reasonable, there be a basic visualization tool which aids learning process of interested candidates and seamlessly integrates into an environment they are already familiar with, so that clarity in concepts can be attained without unwanted jargon. To provide effective learning of CNC, the authors have developed ACAM (Amrita Computer Aided Manufacturing), a software which smoothly integrates into the very familiar environment of Autodesk Inventor in the form of an addin. In the current form, ACAM can perform simulation for drilling, milling and turning operations. It is proposed to be used as a tool to help teachers explain different manufacturing steps and later on allow students to write CNC codes and visualize the resulting motion of the tools and/or workpiece.
