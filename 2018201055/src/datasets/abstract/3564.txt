Currently, 360-degree panoramic images are widely used in the various area and has attracted more attention with the increased support of panoramic movies by Youtube and Facebook. At the same time, the increasing of opensource hardware gives a large contribution for innovation of manufacturing. We challenge to develop an underwater drone which equips fisheye lens for taking the panoramic images and uses an algorithm to generate 360-degree panoramic images. This paper guides to develop an opensourced 360-degree panoramic image generation, and the generation equipped underwater-drone which is extended on a Raspberry Pi computer module. The frame is designed by OpenSCAD, the printed board is designed by MakePro. For realizing the 360-degree panoramic images, the underwater-drone equips two 235-degree fisheye lenses and uses the OpenGL ES2 to for correcting the fisheye images. The goal of this research is using the underwater-drone to investigate the lake, sea and so on. Now, we are trying to investigate the species fishes in the natural lake for helping to protect the original environment.
