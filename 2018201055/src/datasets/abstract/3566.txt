This study examines the role of second- and third-order barriers to classroom computing integration among fourth- and fifth-grade teachers in an urban, low-income school district (i.e., where computing resources are limited, or first-order barriers are high). We examine the impact of teachers' (N = 114) computer anxiety, computer attitudes, and computer feature comfort (i.e., second-order barriers) on their intention to use computer features in their classrooms. We also assess the role of teachersâ€™ participation in training sessions aimed at fostering their design thinking (i.e., third-order barriers). Our results indicate that computer feature comfort and summer institute attendance are the strongest predictors of computing integration in cases where first-order barriers are high. Findings also suggest that tackling third-order barriers may help teachers overcome second-order barriers. Implications for future training interventions are discussed.
