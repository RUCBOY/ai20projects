This work develops a centralized network solution for gamma-ray spectroscopy online acquisition, and could potentially eliminate the client computers from the equipment inventory to reduce cost and maintenance efforts, ideal for teaching laboratory development. The three-ways communication among the server, detectors, and client devices are carried over Internet. The Osprey digital signal processing instrument is switched to network mode and powered by the Power over Ethernet injector. The ProSpect gamma spectroscopy software is hosted as a RemoteApp on Windows Server 2016. It accepts connections from various operating systems supporting Microsoft Remote Desktop protocol with or without additional software. The client devices do not need to install the data acquisition software, and the users can bring their personal laptop or log on any general purpose lab computers to perform data acquisition. In addition, this development demonstrates remote data acquisition of several gamma-ray sources using Windows, LINUX, MAC, iOS, and Android systems as the clients.
