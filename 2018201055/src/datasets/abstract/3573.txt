The omnipresence of the Media in every domain of the human environment has established a special and privileged condition for them. The Media filter, almost every, initial information, even in the case they are not its producer, and acting as their name indicates in the guise of mediators reproduce these facts in such a way that many questions are raised with regard of the moral and representational dimension and potential of the material that makes the news. Even prestigious realms of the human knowledge, like Science and Technology, sometimes under the usage the Media make of their theoretical and material conclusions, become concomitant and generally are strongly biased. The strategies followed by the Media for the selection and endorsement of the candidate researches and discoveries to make the news, the manipulation of the results and the introduction of neologisms or the deformed reproduction of the scientific terms, consequently override the scientific requirements of objectivity and normativity, truthfulness and justifiability, referential and coherence, conceptual and ontological acceptability, the “justified acceptability” of the epistemic method—to put it in M. Dummett’s words. In this paper, we shall examine the modalities the Media enrolls in order to identify, select and promote a scientific information, how and by virtue of which means they interpret, handle (or manipulate) the base- material the various scientific/technological sources provide, the moral and linguistic consequences of this processing.
