In this paper idea of using various non-invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) was in detail presented, in particular BCI-systems using Emotiv EPOC+ headset. This work also describes both concept and project of a system designed for communication of physically disabled patients with external environment using Emotiv EPOC+ headset. The project is still at initial stage, however Graphical User Interface (GUI) was designed and developed based on a pictograph writing system. As the project is still on preliminary stage the system was only tested with the implementation of an inexpensive, above mentioned EEG device (Emotiv EPOC+), which was also in detail characterized and described.
