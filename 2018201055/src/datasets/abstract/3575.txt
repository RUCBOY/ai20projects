Despite the technologically intense nature of the medical radiation science (MRS) profession, literature specifically supporting the adoption of mobile learning in MRS education is scarce. To this aim, we explored student utilization of and influences for choosing MRS applications (apps, a specific type of mobile learning) within the Bachelor of Medical Radiation Science course at Charles Sturt University (CSU), Australia. Secondary objectives briefly investigated content reliability within selected chosen apps and overall student willingness to embrace this methodology prior to mainstream integration.
A mixed-method census survey was delivered to 415 enrolled students using the software Survey Monkey to compile responses to 28 questions. Inclusion criteria included students who owned a smartphone or tablet and who used any apps listed on the survey.
Among the 97 students who completed the survey, 37% (36/97) freely use MRS apps at least weekly (70%, 21/30), of which anatomy atlases were reported as most popular. Peer recommendation influenced 67% (20/30) of students to choose the MRS apps used. Thirty-seven percent (11/30) of students integrated only one method to check the accuracy of app content prior to download. Students who do not use MRS apps (78%, 76/97) stated they were unaware of this resource; however, 91% (80/88) of the respondents indicated they would use MRS apps if incorporated into the curriculum.
The majority of CSU students agreed that apps offer a convenient way to engage in a variety of interactive content both in the classroom and on-the-go, using apps most pertinent to their specific curriculum and/or for revision. Students preferred to use MRS apps if integrated as supplemental study tools vetted by the lecturer.
