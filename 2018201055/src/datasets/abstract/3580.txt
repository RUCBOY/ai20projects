There are many different methods of meniscal allograft measurements, which depend on individual tissue bank procedures. Due to the lack of a standardised method of dimensioning, measurement results may vary between individual cases. Consequently, allograft may be mismatched to the patient's knee anatomy. The purpose of this study was to measure four meniscal dimensions – two standard and two specific – and then compare them between sexes.
Fourteen cadaveric lateral menisci (seven male and seven female) were scanned using a microtomography scanner. The obtained three-dimensional (3-D) models of each meniscus were analysed, taking into account four dimensions: circumference, width, central meniscal concavity, and total meniscal volume. The computer researcher was not informed of the original data of the meniscal samples until the calculations were completed.
No statistical between-sex differences were found in the standard dimensions. The specific dimensions, in turn, presented statistically significant between-sex differences (P > 0.05). The mean difference between male and female total volume of the meniscus was equal to 36.59%, and the mean difference between male and female central meniscal concavity surface was equal to 31.22%.
This study found that sex should be taken into account as an important factor during a matching procedure performed by tissue bank staff.
