In cognitive radio networks (CRNs), access to unused portions of the licensed spectrum by secondary users renders the system vulnerable to malicious attack. A number of channel hopping schemes with anti-jamming capability have been proposed; however, existing solutions require the pre-sharing of access information or cannot guarantee rendezvous success. Furthermore, existing channel hopping schemes with anti-jamming capability do not consider variations in the traffic loads of different nodes. In this study, we developed a novel anti-jamming scheme, which allows for the dynamic adjustment of the sending/receiving ratio to maximize the throughput of an SU node. The proposed Load Awareness Anti-jamming channel hopping scheme is based on extended Langford pairing. The proposed scheme guarantees rendezvous for any pair of nodes, and was shown in simulations to outperform Sec-CH and Tri-CH in terms of throughput and TTR.
