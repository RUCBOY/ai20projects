The main aim of this contribution is to develop a co-words analysis of the Industry 4.0 research field in order to highlight the themes covered in the last five years (2013â€“2017). The software tool SciMAT is employed using an approach that allows us to uncover the main research themes and analyze them according to their performance and impact measures. An amount of 333 documents were retrieved from the Web of Science. Our key findings are that the most important research themes were Cyber-Physical-Systems and Cloud-Computing.
