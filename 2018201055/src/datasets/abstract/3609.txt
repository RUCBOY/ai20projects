Simulation is a very important tool which has been used for several years in several fields (with computer and non computer systems). Given its importance, simulation has been used as soon as possible during a system’s design phase. This paradigm is called ”Simulation-Based Design” or SBD. Using SBD aims at eliminating unfit designs as early as possible before significant resources have been consumed. It is the process in which simulation is the primary means of evaluation and verification. In this paper, we give an overview about related works. We classify the related work in three classes: simulation to design non computer systems in several domains, simulation to design software and simulation to design Multi-Agent Systems, Self-Organizing Systems or Systems with Emergent Functionality.
