In this paper an innovative approach in providing formalised method of analysis AGILE policies was in short presented. For the purpose of such policies validation the Definition Language was undertaken. The proposed method plays a significant role while using AGILE policies in certain applications such as inter alia control systems or safety critical systems. The method proposed in this paper can be successfully applied for the purpose of AGILE policies validation. One version of a policy used for managing an Air Cooling system will be as an example discussed.
