The paper presents the interaction mechanism between investors and producers in a decentralized economic system. The main element of the interaction is the iterative process. In this process, each investor takes into account the contributions of other investors into producers. The model is investigated by means of the computer simulation, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the considered mechanism.
