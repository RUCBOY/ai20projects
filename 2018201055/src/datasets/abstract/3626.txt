Saliency detection has become an active topic in both computer vision and multimedia fields. In this paper, we propose a novel computational model for saliency detection by integrating the holistic center-directional map with the principal local color contrast (PLCC) map. In the proposed framework, perceptual directional patches are firstly detected based on discrete wavelet frame transform (DWFT) and sparsity criterion, then the center of the spatial distribution of the extracted directional patches are utilized to locate the salient object in an image. Meanwhile, we proposed an efficient local color contrast method, called principal local color contrast (PLCC), to compute the color contrast between the salient object and the image background, which is sufficient to highlight and separate salient objects from complex background while dramatically reduce the computational cost. Finally, by incorporating the complementary visual cues of the global center-directional map with the PLCC map, a final compounded saliency map can be generated. Extensive experiments performed on three publicly available image databases, verify that the proposed scheme is able to achieve satisfactory results compared to other state-of-the-art saliency-detection algorithms.
