To facilitate research in dynamic spectrum access, 5G, vehicular networks, underground wireless communications, and radio frequency machine learning, a city-wide experimental testbed is developed to provide realistic radio environment, standardized experimental configurations, reusable datasets, and advanced computational resources. The testbed contains 5 cognitive radio sites, and covers 1.1 square miles across two campuses of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a public street in the city of Lincoln, Nebraska. Each site is equipped with a 4x4 MIMO software-defined radio transceiver with 20Gbps fronthaul connectivity. Additional cognitive radio transceivers with an underground 2x2 MIMO antenna are included in a site. High speed fronthaul network based on dedicated fiber connects the 5 sites to a cloud-based central unit for data processing and storage. The testbed provides researchers rich computational resources such as arrays of CPUs and GPUs at the cloud and FPGAs at both the edge and fronthaul network. Developed via the collaboration of the university, city, and industrial partners, this testbed will facilitate education and researches in academic and industrial communities.
