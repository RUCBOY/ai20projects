In present time, Wireless sensor network (WSNs) is widely adopted in diverse field like engineering, sciences, health, home, military, railway stations, airports, industries etc. Agriculture is also a warm of area in which WSNs is used to improve production, monitoring, intruder prevention and profitability of the crops and in turn Precision agriculture (PA). Further, integration of WSNs in agriculture can monitor the progress of the crops and provide real time data to the farmers such as moistures, temperature, water and other resources. In this paper, a sensor device with the help of Arduino board is designed to monitors the growth of valeriana jatamansi plant in the greenhouse. The proposed device is capable to sense the moisture of soil and detect the insects in the planting area of plant. The data from the greenhouse to the farmerâ€™s base station is transmitted through the help of Wi-Fi module.
