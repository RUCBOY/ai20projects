In this paper, we present Tesla’s Fountain in ceramics technology reconstruction from basic 3D model, simulation of the engine, light and fluids till the real materialization. As the one of the most important model purposes, we enrich this solution by additional multicolor lights. All of this elements are designed based on Tesla’s original patent no. 1,113,716, US patent office, granted Oct,13. In this model we applied ceramics technology based on ceramic materials casting and sintering. At the time when the patent was granted, the metal materials science and technologies were more advanced than the ceramics technology and applications. We performed all materials characteristics analyses and preparation steps based on the one author’s patent no. 46121, Serbia patent office, granted 21.12.1991. This is one original two patents solution with complete new over-bridging by the state-of-the-art computer modeling and simulation technology.
