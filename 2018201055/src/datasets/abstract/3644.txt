Extension deformity of the distal humerus after a malunited supracondylar fracture can restrict elbow flexion. Here we report a computer-assisted operative procedure and review the results of clinical cases in which corrective surgery was performed.
The medical records of the patients who underwent corrective osteotomy for hyperextended elbow malunion of the distal humerus with limited elbow flexion (flexion angle ≤100°) were reviewed retrospectively. Osteotomy was performed using patient-specific instruments designed based on preoperative 3-dimensional computer simulation.
Three patients, a 55-year-old woman and two 12-year-old boys, met the inclusion criteria. The angles of hyperextension of the affected distal humerus were 29°, 29°, and 25°, respectively. The range of flexion/extension of the elbow motion in the first patient improved from 95°/25° preoperatively to 140°/−10° postoperatively, in the second patient from 100°/20° to 145°/5°, and in the third patient from 80°/25° to 140°/10°. Bone union was achieved in all patients. There were no major complications. The corrective operations not only improved elbow flexion but also increased the total range of motion in the elbow by rebuilding the anterior curve of the distal humerus.
Correction of the extension deformity of the distal humerus after a malunited supracondylar fracture is a reasonable option for patients older than 10 years with restricted elbow flexion. Preoperative computer simulation and the use of patient-specific instruments can be a useful alternative that enables accurate deformity correction and improves the total range of motion.
