Task models are powerful artifacts as they are the result of requirement analysis at the design and development stages. Unfortunately, their uses are limited at gathering requirements and specification for systems and they are almost not employed anymore after design step despite their cost in terms of time and effort. In fact, task models bring many benefits at operation time, when the system has been already deployed as: it represents user documentation; it is used for training operators, etc. Moreover, human performance depends on cognitive mechanisms. It evolves simultaneously with personal, environmental and social factor which defines the context. Any changes within the context can affect the reliability of human performance by committing errors or deviations which can cause serious accidents especially for life-critical systems. These deviations are not taken into consideration within task model as it is produced at design time and remains unchanged even when it is reused at operation time. The work reported in this paper aims at proposing an approach to create and generate at real time a deduced task model from the original one corresponding to a certain situation at a specified context. The goal is also to ensure that user system interaction in a critical situation is performed as planned and there is no detected deviation. Machine learning techniques are used to predict what tasks user should perform and what ones he/she should not. They enable to learn about human computer interaction variations in the future in order to mend task model. This approach will be evaluated through experiments in simulated scenarios about on-board car system.
