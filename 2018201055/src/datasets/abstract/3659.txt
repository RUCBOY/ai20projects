The use of radiological prosthesis is to protect from radiotherapy side effects. Fabricating the prosthesis in a conventional way is difficult for eyelid cancer patients.

In this report we used non-contact impression to fabricate radiotherapy prostheses with computer-aided designed/computer-aided-manufactured (CAD/CAM) technique.
