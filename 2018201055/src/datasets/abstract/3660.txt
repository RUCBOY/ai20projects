This paper describes the construction of a 3D map of an indoor environment using the RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect V2.0). 3D mapping and localization have always been an intriguing topic in research and with the introduction of Microsoft Kinect sensor, the research has grown rapidly. In this paper, we propose a method to generate the 3D map of an indoor environment using the Microsoft Kinect version 2.0 sensor. The results obtained show an improvement over the previously used methods. We believe that this would contribute to many applications such as computer vision, robotics, home automation etc.
