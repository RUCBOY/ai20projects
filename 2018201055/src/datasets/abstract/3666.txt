We present the new methodology ONTO-PLC to deliver software programs on system-on-chip or single-board computers used to control industrial plants, as substitutes for programmable logic control technologies. The methodology is ontology-driven based on the abstract description of the plant at a level in which the plant itself is viewed as a set of instruments, each instrument being a set of machineries coordinated in functional terms by a control system, formed by sensors and actuators, under the control of an abstract model of behavior delivered by means of an extended finite state machine.
