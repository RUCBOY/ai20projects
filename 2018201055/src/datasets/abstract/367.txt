In MANET network management, the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) plays a vital role in terms of controller plane and data plane. It is always easy to manage the data communication over the MANET because of logically centralized control on the SDN. Since the dynamic route on MANET, are controls the packets and changes the route between the source to destination alternatively. Hence the maintenance of real-time SDN analysis-based application planes is a crucial process. To maintain the effective MANET communication over the Software-Defined Network, it essential to improve the control and data plane process on the SDN controlled MANET based OpenFlow switching procedure. Nevertheless, SDN allows for route interaction against security threads. In this research article, the four stages were suggested to preserve the security measures in packet-based data transmission that are conceived in MANET. In this article, an SDN controlled MANET based OpenFlow switching scenario for effective security threading is proposed. The major part played by an SDN controlled MANET in bringing about a result of being effective without wasting time and energy on routing. The proposed Distinct Network Yarning (DISNEY) routing protocol for SDN controlled MANET overcomes the congestion communication on MANET routing. To decrease performance degradation, efficient routing is maintained by the route matrix manipulation table. This routing scheme helps to find the optimal routing with a secure and intelligent manner. The proposed result was compared to existing approaches. As a result, the proposed illustration to be improved by routing and data transmission. In comparison to the proposed method achieves a better ratio for packet transmission delay, throughput, and data transmission rate.
