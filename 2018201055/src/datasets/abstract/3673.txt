DNA is known as the building block of live organisms for storing the life codes and transferring the genetic features through the generations. However, it is found that DNA strands can be used for a new kind of computation. DNA computation proposes a new level of impressive degree of parallelism that is not feasible with conventional electronic computers. However, available computational models cannot be used for massive parallelism in DNA computing and new computation models and techniques should be developed.
In this paper, a new computational model and methodology is proposed to use the massive parallelism of DNA-based circuits. In the proposed model, billions of DNA strands are utilized to compute the elements of the Boolean function concurrently to reach a high level of parallelism. Simulation and analytical results prove the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method. Moreover, analyses and results show that delay of a circuit in this method is independent from the complexity of the function and each Boolean function can be computed with O(1) time complexity.
