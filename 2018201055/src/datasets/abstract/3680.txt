Papaya grading is performed manually which may lead to misclassifications, resulting in fruit boxes with different maturity stages. The objective is to predict the ripening of the papaya fruit using digital imaging and random forests. A series of physical/chemical analyses are carried out and true maturity stage is derived from pulp firmness measurements. Imaging and image analysis provides hand-crafted color features computed from the peel and random decision forests are implemented to predict ripening stage. More specifically, a total of 114 samples from 57 fruits are used for the experiments, and classified into three stages of maturity. After image acquisition and analysis, twenty-one hand-crafted color features (comprising seven groups) that have low computational cost are extracted and evaluated. Random forests with two datasets (cross-validation and prediction set) are employed for the experiments. Concerning all image features, 94.3% classification performance is obtained over the cross-validation set. The prediction set obtained 94.7% misclassifying only a single sample. For the group comparisons, the normalized mean of the RGB (red, green, blue) color space achieved better performance (78.1%). Essentially, the technique can mature into an industrial application with the right integration framework.
