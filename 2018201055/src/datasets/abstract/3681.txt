We propose a method of efficiently calculating computer-generated hologram for holographic stereoscopic display. The stereoscopic hologram is generated by sequentially tiling all the hogels that are calculated from respective parallax intensity and depth maps based on nonuniform sampled wavefront recording plane (NS-WRP) algorithm. The whole computational procedure is simplified by diffraction calculation of hogels from 2D planar images of each viewpoint, instead of massive 3D point-source. Numerical and optical experiments are carried out to confirm the feasibility of the proposed method.
