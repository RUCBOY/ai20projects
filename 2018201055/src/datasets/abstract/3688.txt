This study provides a current systematic review of eye tracking research in the domain of multimedia learning. The particular aim of the review is to explore how cognitive processes in multimedia learning are studied with relevant variables through eye tracking technology. To this end, 52 articles, including 58 studies, were analyzed. Remarkable results are that (1) there is a burgeoning interest in the use of eye tracking technology in multimedia learning research; (2) studies were mostly conducted with college students, science materials, and the temporal and count scales of eye tracking measurements; (3) eye movement measurements provided inferences about the cognitive processes of selecting, organizing, and integrating; (4) multimedia learning principles, multimedia content, individual differences, metacognition, and emotions were the potential factors that can affect eye movement measurements; and (5) findings were available for supporting the association between cognitive processes inferred by eye tracking measurements and learning performance. Specific gaps in the literature and implications of existing findings on multimedia learning design were also determined to offer suggestions for future research and practices.
