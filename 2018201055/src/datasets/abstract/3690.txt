Software process capability maturity models are currently widely used in industry. To perform the practices defined in these models, software engineering approaches are applied. We have experimented the definition of a large number of methods, techniques, patterns, and standards for the conception, design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive systems focusing on Humanâ€“Computer Interaction (HCI) issues. Nevertheless, it is well-known that HCI approaches are not largely used in industry. In order to take advantage of the widespread use of capability maturity models, we have worked on the identification of appropriate HCI approaches for each practice of the engineering advocated by the most known model - the CMMI-DEV (Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development). By exploring the CMMI-DEV and the literature, we identified a set of HCI approaches for the development of interactive systems. Twenty HCI experts were interviewed for the Validation and improvement of this initial set. As a result, we identified 14 HCI categories of approaches with examples of methods, techniques, patterns, and standards adequate for performing engineering practices of the CMMI-DEV when developing interactive systems.
