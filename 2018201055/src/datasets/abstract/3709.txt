Japanâ€™s population is aging rapidly, and the number of people who need caregivers is expected to increase dramatically. Establishing a method of educating the human resources who will meet this need is an urgent task. In this study, we visualized the differences between expert and novice caregiver behaviors and considered how to bring them to the attention of learners. We used three-dimensional computer graphics (3DCG) images of caregivers to develop web-based learning materials to support the learning of applied nursing skills. We then had the materials evaluated by nursing/caregiving professionals to confirm their effectiveness in teaching those skills.
