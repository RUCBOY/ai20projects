Photo-anthropometry is a metric-based facial image comparison technique where measurements of the face are taken from an image using predetermined facial landmarks. In particular, dimensions and proportionality indices (DPIs) are compared to DPIs from another facial image. Different studies concluded that photo-anthropometric facial comparison, as it is currently practiced, is unsuitable for elimination purposes. The major limitation is the need for images acquired under very restrictive, controlled conditions. To overcome this latter issue, we propose a novel methodology to estimate 3D DPIs from 2D ones. It uses computer graphic techniques to simulate thousands of facial photographs under known camera conditions and regression to derive the mathematical relationship between 2D and 3D DPIs automatically. Additionally, we present a methodology that makes use of the estimated 3D DPIs for reducing the number of potential matches of a given unknown facial photograph within a set of known candidates.
The error in the estimation of the 3D DPIs can be as large as 35%, but both I and III quartiles are consistently inside the Â±5% range. The methodology for filtering cases has demonstrated to be useful in the task of narrowing down the list of possible candidates for a given photograph. It is able to remove on average (validated using cross-validation technique) 57% and 24% of the negative cases, depending on the amounts of DPIs available. Limitations of the work developed together with open research lines are included within the Discussion section.
