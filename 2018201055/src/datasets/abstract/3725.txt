People with motor disabilities – e.g. in the hand – due to brain and spinal cord injuries often suffer an extensive loss of autonomy, performance and quality of life. Although the limitations of a brain-controlled hand exoskeleton can be reduced to a certain extent, the usability for everyday use is still insufficient. In this short paper we describe a research project in progress for a new human-machine interaction concept, based on a brain-computer interface and augmented reality glasses, which aims to improve the usability of brain-controlled hand exoskeletons.
