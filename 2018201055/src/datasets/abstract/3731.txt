Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is an attractive and demanding problem in human computer interaction. Facial expressions are one of the most dominant and usual means for a human to communicate their feelings and intentions. This paper proposes the Enhanced Modified Decision Based Unsymmetric Trimmed Median Filter (EMDBUTMF) method which removes the noisy pixels from the face image. Also, this paper proposes the Local Directional Number (LDN) pattern, Dominant Gradient Local Ternary Pattern (DGLTP) descriptor for feature extraction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for classification. The histogram features are extracted from face images using the LDN and DGLTP descriptors. The experimental result shows that the proposed method gives an improved performance of 88% accuracy on two publicly available facial expression datasets JAFFE and CK.
