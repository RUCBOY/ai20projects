In this paper, the initial dips detected from the prefrontal cortex are used for the control of a quadcopter. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is used to detect the initial dips in the hemodynamic signals corresponding to mental arithmetic and mental counting for development of a brain-computer interface. Five healthy subjects participated in the experiment. A frequency domain fNIRS system is used to measure the chromophores of oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin in the blood. Instead of using the conventional classification methods to generate commands, we have used vector phase analysis with a threshold circle from the resting state as a decision criterion to generate the commands. We are able to transmit commands to quadcopter in 0.1 s after the initial dip is detected. In this current work, we controlled the rotation and height of the drone while keeping the forward velocity at 0.5 m/s. In comparison to support vector machine, our method was able to achieve 18% better control of the quadcopter. The results show the significance of the vector phase analysis for BCI.
