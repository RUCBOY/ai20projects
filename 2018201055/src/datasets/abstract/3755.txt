The DTI-based tractography, despite its restrictions, is the most widely utilized fiber tracking method in clinical practice. Its fidelity is strictly dependent on the precision and accuracy of the DTI measurement, which in turn is limited by the linearity of the diffusion sensitizing gradient.
The influence of the gradient distortions on the differences between the real and measured orientation of fibers was investigated by computer simulations. In addition, the potential of the b-matrix Spatial Distribution in DTI (BSD-DTI) technique in correcting such kind of errors was demonstrated experimentally.
The simulations revealed that the diffusion gradient inhomogeneity, if not corrected, leads to the erroneous indication of the fiber direction. The average and maximum deviations were about 1° and 15°, respectively. Remarkably, the deviation between the real and measured orientation of fibers is directionally dependent, what was confirmed in MRI measurement. The deviation errors can be effectively corrected by preceding the DTI measurement with the BSD-DTI calibration.
