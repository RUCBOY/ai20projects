Remote sensing and hyperspectral data analysis are areas offering wide range of valuable practical applications. However, they generate massive and complex data that is very difficult to be analyzed by a human being. Therefore, methods for efficient data representation and data mining are of high interest to these fields. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for feature extraction and classification of hyperspectral images. To obtain a compressed representation we propose to extract a set of statistical-based properties from these images. This allows for embedding feature space into fourteen channels, obtaining a significant dimensionality reduction. These features are used as an input for the ensemble learning based on randomized neural networks. We introduce a novel method for forming ensembles of Extreme Learning Machines based on randomized feature subspaces and a trained combiner. It is based on continuous outputs and uses a perceptron-based learning scheme to calculate weights assigned to each classifier and class independently. Extensive experiments carried on a number of benchmarks images prove that using proposed feature extraction and extreme learning ensemble leads to a significant gain in classification accuracy.
