Years ago, data visualizations were almost exclusively used for decision making and data analysis. However, recently visualizations are more utilized for marketing sales tools and many other tasks; and therefore more memorable visualizations are desirable. Thus, studying memorability and automatically assessing visualizations or images memorability is becoming a challenging topic in computer vision. This topic purpose is to list and analyze the characteristics of memorable visualizations/images, in order to establish a predictive model for memorability. Previous methods mainly use techniques to analyze visualizations memorability. In this paper, we use data related to visual attention combined with image features to significantly study visualizations memorability and construct a representative model of visualization memorability. We test our proposed method on MASSVIS data set, by using different classification methods and we significantly reach performed classification rates.
