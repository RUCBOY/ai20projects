Accurate vascular geometry modeling is an essential task in computer assisted vascular surgery and therapy. This paper presents a vessel cross-section based implicit vascular modeling technique, which represents a vascular surface as a set of locally fitted implicit surfaces. In the proposed method, a cross-section based technique is employed to extract from each cross-section of the vascular surface a set of points, which are then fitted with an implicit curve represented as 2D radial basis functions. All these implicitly represented cross-section curves are then being considered as 3D cylindrical objects and combined together using a certain partial shape-preserving spline to build a complete vessel branch; different vessel branches are then blended using a extended smooth maximum function to construct the complete vascular tree. Experimental results show that the proposed method can correctly represent the morphology and topology of vascular structures with high level of smoothness. Both qualitative comparison with other methods and quantitative validations to the proposed method have been performed to verify the accuracy and smoothness of the generated vascular geometric models.
