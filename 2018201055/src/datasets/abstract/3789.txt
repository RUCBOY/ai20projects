The ever-expanding urbanization and the advent of smart cities need better crowd management and security surveillance systems. Advanced systems are required to improve and automate the crowd management system. The aim of the closed circuit television and visual monitoring systems using multiple cameras faces many challenges like illumination variance, occlusion and small spatialâ€“temporal resolution, person in sleep, shadows, dynamic backgrounds, and noises. Therefore, the crowd monitoring, prevention of stampedes and crowd-related emergencies in the smart cities are major challenging problems. In this paper, we propose an intelligent decision computing based paradigm for crowd monitoring in the smart city. In the intelligent computing based framework, the optimization algorithm is applied to compute the feature of crowd motion and measure the correlation between agents based motion model and the crowd data using extended Kalman filtering approach and KL-divergence technique. The proposed framework measures the correlation measure based on extracted novel distinctive feature, and holistic feature of crowd data represent and to classify the crowd motion of individual. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields 96.20% average precision in classifying real-world highly dense crowd scenes.
