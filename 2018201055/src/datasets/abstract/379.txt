Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a fundamental and important low-level computer vision (CV) task, yet its performance on real-world applications is not always satisfactory. Different from the previous SISR research, we focus on a specific but realistic SR issue: How can we obtain satisfied SR results from compressed JPG (C-JPG) images, which is a ubiquitous image format to greatly release storage space while missing fine details. the JPG SR task is deeply analyzed to discover the connotation. Then, we propose an effective two-step model structure named RGSR, involving two specifically designed components, i.e., JPG recovering and SR generation, instead of the perspective of noise elimination in traditional SR approaches. Besides, we further integrate the cycle loss to build a hybrid objective across scales for better SR generation. Experimental results on both of the standard test data sets and real images show that our approach achieves outstanding results and succeed in applying to practical C-JPG SR tasks.
