The rapid increase in usage of personal computers, internet and digital multimedia technology leads to easily sharing of digital data/ media. However, availability of numerous image processing tools facilitate unauthorized use of such data. Unauthorized users/ attackers can easily copy, delete or modify digital data. This problem of illegal modification/ reproduction of digital data, leads to innovation of some techniques which can protect intellectual property rights of digital data/ media. Recently, watermarking has been identified as a major tool to attain copyright protection/ authentication. A digital watermark can be embedded in host data in spatial domain as well as in frequency domain. In this work a hybridized technique incorporating Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) has been presented.
