Today and with the development of computer technologies, traditional learning, which offers a static content for all learners, is no longer desired in learning environments. As a result, the exploitation of this development has given rise to new methods of learning. The mobile learning is one of these methods and specifically the adaptive mobile learning or context-aware mobile learning. Generally, the learning process goes through several stages; the assessment is part of this process and it is a key step in the learning activity, taking several ways. When we talk about an adaptive learning, we should think also about an adaptive assessment, where the learner can take an adaptive test content according to their context. In this paper, we present the Adaptive Formative Assessment in Context-Aware Mobile Learning (AFA-CAML) approach. The goal of this approach is to provide learners with an adaptive and personalized formative assessment taking into account the learner context based on the CAT (Computerized Adaptive Tests) theory.
