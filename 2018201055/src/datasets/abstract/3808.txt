In the computer-aided diagnosis of retinal images, the location of the optic disc plays an important supporting role in the location of the macula, the segmentation of the blood vessel and the determination of the location of the lesions. In order to avoid the failure of the location of optic discs due to the misjudgment and segmentation of the blood vessels and the changes of brightness caused by the lesions, this paper proposes an algorithm of optic disc localization based on an improved corner detection algorithm by using the feature that the distribution of vessels in the optic disc area is complicated and the corner distribution is the densest. The localization of the optic disc location by using this method in the 3 databases shows that this method can effectively locate the optic disc and has higher accuracy and real-time performance. This method provides a new idea for the localization of the optic disc.
