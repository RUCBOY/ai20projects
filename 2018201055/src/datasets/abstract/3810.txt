This paper presents m-PaRoLa, an educational virtual laboratory that consists of Javascript simulations for analyzing parallel robots. These simulations can be run indistinctly on web browsers of desktop computers or mobile devices (smartphones, tablets), which turns m-PaRoLa into a mobile virtual laboratory ready to be integrated in m-learning methodologies for teaching robotics and mechanisms. The presented simulations, which are highly intuitive and visual, allow the user to analyze diverse kinematic problems of parallel robots.
