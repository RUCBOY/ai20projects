Exercises are an essential part of learning university-level mathematics. Automated assessments provide an easy and flexible way to create new exercises for students. Moreover, students’ performances may be monitored in real time. In 2012, we started to test a mathematical exercise creation system originally created in Lappeenranta University of Technology (LUT). The functionality of this system was jointly piloted by LUT and the National Defence University (NDU). The system was tested in the NDU basic mathematics course with 137 cadets.
We show in this article that students who used the automated exercise system scored better on examinations than the students from the previous and following year who could not use the system. A statistical summary of the students’ results is presented at the end of this paper to support this conclusion.
We will also compare this system to the other systems in the market and consider whether it makes sense for universities to develop this kind of system or whether it is simply a waste of time and money.
