Point of care testing device is a diagnostic tool that can provide clinically relevant information without the need for a core clinical laboratory, and it has been widely used in medical diagnostics, food safety and environmental monitoring during the last years. This research aims to develop an affordable and portable POCT device for improving disease screening in the developing world. This device is based on the embedded ARM, bioelectrical impedance measuring technology (BIMT) detection and spectrophotometry detection approach, and it consists of optical module, data acquisition, microprocessor, human-computer interaction, power supply and communication interface module. The optical module adopts 532nm LED as a green light source. A silicon photodiode, operational amplifier and 16 bit A/D converter are used to accomplish photoelectric signal change, amplification and analog-to-digital conversion. The microprocessor is STM32F407ZGT6 chip ARM based on Cortex-M3 kernel. Touch screen LCD combined with Matrix keyboard are utilized to insure human-computer interaction. The test results are stored in SD card, and can be printed in real-time by a built-in thermal printer. This portable device has USB and Bluetooth connector with a lithium battery as a power supply.
