Convolutional neural network (CNN) has demonstrated its superior ability to achieve amazing accuracy in computer vision field. Nevertheless, for practical domain-specific image recognition tasks, it still remains difficult to obtain massive high-quality labeled datasets due to the strong requirements for extensive, tedious manual processing. Inspired by the well-known observation that human brain can accurately recognize objects without relying on massive congeneric examples, we propose a novel deep variance network (DVN) to further enhance the generalization ability of CNN in this paper, which could still produce higher recognition accuracy even with unbalanced training datasets than original CNN. The key idea of our DVN is built upon the intrinsic exploitation of inter-class homogeneity and intra-class heterogeneity. Towards such goal, we make the first attempt to incorporate a hierarchical Bayesian model into the powerful CNN framework, which can transfer the joint feature distribution from certain object’s complete training dataset to other object’s incomplete training dataset in an iterative way. In each training cycle, the CNN-resulted features are clustered into discrimination-related subspaces to guide the learning and adaptive adjustment of homogeneity and heterogeneity over unbalanced training datasets. In practice, we furnish several state-of-the-art deep networks with our proposed DVN, and conduct extensive experiments and comprehensive evaluations over CIFAR-10, MNIST, and SVHN benchmarks. The experiments have shown that, most of the furnished deep networks can benefit from our DVN, wherein they gain at most 6.9% accuracy improvement over CIFAR-10 benchmark, 52.83% error reduction over MNIST benchmark, and an improvement of 6.2% over SVHN datasets.
