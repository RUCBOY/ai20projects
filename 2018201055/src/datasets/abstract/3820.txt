In this work we describe an appropriate pipeline for using deep-learning as a form of improving the brain functional connectivity-based fingerprinting process which is based in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data-processing results. This pipeline approach is mostly intended for neuroscientists, biomedical engineers, and physicists that are looking for an easy form of using fMRI-based Deep-Learning in identifying people, drastic brain alterations in those same people, and/or pathologic consequences to people’s brains. Computer scientists and engineers can also gain by noticing the data-processing improvements obtained by using the here-proposed pipeline. With our best approach, we obtained an average accuracy of 0.3132 ± 0.0129 and an average validation cost of 3.1422 ± 0.0668, which clearly outperformed the published Pearson correlation approach performance with a 50 Nodes parcellation which had an accuracy of 0.237.
