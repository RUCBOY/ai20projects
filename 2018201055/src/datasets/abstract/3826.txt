The main cause of death in most countries of the world is cardiovascular diseases. Heart transplant or/and the usage of a Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) is often a form of treatment for severe heart diseases. The objective of this study is to analyze the importance of volute vanes in the efficiency of a new type of VAD, the Transventricular Assist Device (TVAD). Investigations concerning the hydrodynamic performance are conducted using finite element methods aiming at the best conditions to support the circulatory system and to avoid to the maximum areas of turbulent flow. Two three-dimensional pump models were created using computer aided design system, one without and the other with volute vanes. Flow in both models was, then, analyzed by Computer Fluid Dynamic (CFD) tools. Analyses showed that, when volute contains vanes, flow is redirected toward the rotor while, in the case of volute without vanes, the fluid recirculates in the pumpâ€™s interior. From now on, TVAD studies will always consider the presence of vanes in the volute.
