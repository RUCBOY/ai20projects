Holographic display is regarded as one of the most promising technologies to realize real three dimensional (3D) display in the near future. However, it is limited to low quality reconstruction and time consuming. In this paper, we present an effective design method of computer generated hologram (CGH), special constraints are introduced to control the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the holographic image with high speed and accuracy, and high resolution of the holographic image to reduce speckles and granularsensation. Finally, simulation experiments are carried out to verify the performance of the proposed method. This work also can provide a feasible algorithm tool for holographic near-eye display in the field of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).
