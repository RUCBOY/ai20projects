The current work is aimed at providing understanding on the effect of deformation history on the dynamic response of austenite. Approach to study the influence of deformation mode on the subsequent high strain rate behavior of austenite is presented. Specially designed austenite model alloy is subjected to plastometric tests with two deformation routes. Then, high strain rate behavior of developed microstructures is tested using drop weight testing. In parallel, numerical tools are employed to simulate both quasi-static and dynamic response of those materials. As a result, high strain rate behavior after various deformation histories is modelled and discussed.
