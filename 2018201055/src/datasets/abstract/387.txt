We present two simple yet effective methods to realize holographic three-dimensional (3D) display by partitioned Fresnel diffraction (PFreD) and partitioned Fraunhofer diffraction (PFraD). After a 3D object is divided into a set of layers in axial direction, these layers are calculated into corresponding sub-holograms. These two methods are used to develop a tiling approach to hologram construction and reconstruction. Both simulations and experiments are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed methods. The similarities and differences between PFreD and PFraD are analyzed in details for better understanding. These two methods may provide promising solutions in future holographic 3D realization with their own characteristics and scope of application.
