Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has become a strategic critical subject in many business processes, since enterprises not only need to provide good products or services, but they also have to demonstrate that they are environmentally and socially responsible. In this context, enterprises should use appropriate computer systems in order to manage CSR ensuring the adoption of best practices with the aim of obtaining competitive advantages. On the other hand, Model-Driven Engineering is a proven and accepted paradigm that provides sound mechanisms to develop quality and reliable computer systems in an efficient way starting from business models. The main results presented in this paper are a CSR Metamodel and a CSR UML profile that provide a Domain-Specific Modelling Language (DSML) to represent CSR. This DSML supports the design of CSR Computer Independent Models (CIM) that are the starting point for Model-Driven Engineering development. To propose this DSML to represent CSR we analysed international standards, guides and regulations on CSR and we reviewed CSR strategies developed by different companies in order to define the artifacts of the CSR Metamodel. Finally, a practical case study using this DSML is provided in order to improve and to validate the defined CSR Metamodel, and to show how to apply the proposal in an actual company.
