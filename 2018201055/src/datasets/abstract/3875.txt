Systems capable of estimating visibility distances under foggy weather conditions are extremely useful for next-generation cooperative situational awareness and collision avoidance systems. In this paper, we present a brief review of noticeable approaches for determining visibility distance under foggy weather conditions. We then propose a novel approach based on the combination of a deep learning method for feature extraction and an SVM classifier. We present a quantitative evaluation of the proposed solution and show that our approach provides better performance results compared to an earlier approach that was based on the combination of an ANN model and a set of global feature descriptors. Our experimental results show that the proposed solution presents very promising results in support for next-generation situational awareness and cooperative collision avoidance systems. Hence it can potentially contribute towards safer driving conditions in the presence of fog.
