Image registration is one of the fundamental research areas in image processing and computer vision, which plays a crucial and irreplaceable role in the field of image navigation. In this paper, an overview of 3D image navigation and high precision dynamic registration in minimally invasive surgery are presented. Firstly, the main principles of modern medical image registration techniques were introduced, and its new characteristics in modern image survey navigation were analyzed. Secondly, the feature-based and gray-based image matching methods are studied, which are the basic idea behind the image registration technique. Meanwhile, the advantages and disadvantages of these two image matching algorithms itself and the shortcomings in the application of image registration were also analyzed. Finally, the superiority of noise robust and high-resolution image feature detection methods in the field of image registration have been analyzed, which may be a valuable direction of future research.
