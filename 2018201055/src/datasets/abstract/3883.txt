The ongoing digitalization of enterprise computing solutions and the creation of ubiquitous workspaces offer new advantages for many business domains. However, it is cost- and work-intensive to create these new kinds of workspaces by adopting interconnecting things and migrating applications into the cloud. On the other, enterprises increasingly strive for the potential of the new workspace opportunities to support their operational processes in the best way. For this purpose, we present an approach to enhance the integration of human resources into business processes by gathering environmental information and reacting to situational changes of workers. More specifically, we present a framework based on beacon technology to determine a situational priority for work items with the goal to properly support the worker in his or her decision-making process. We regard such framework as important aspect for many business domains in order to cope with the demands emerging in the light of work management that requires ubiquitous access to all enterprise resources in the best possible way.
