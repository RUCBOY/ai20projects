The application of permeation technique in the surface-limited regime for determining the rates of hydrogen absorption and desorption and terminal solid solubility for precipitation in hydride-forming metals is discussed in detail. The validity of various approximate expressions used to process the experimental data is verified by comparison with the results of computer simulation. Examples of the processing of the experimental curves obtained in the study of hydrogen permeation are presented, and the main attention is paid to possible limitations of the approximations used.
