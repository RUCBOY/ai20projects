In this study, a computer simulation for the microstructure, heat and mass transport properties of cement paste is established. Constituent phases and pore structure of cement paste are analyzed in detail and a three-level representation of multiscale microstructure of cement paste is constructed based on some reasonable assumptions. Simulated results are comprehensively analyzed and verified, which proves the reliability and efficiency of the presented simulation. Based on the simulated microstructure, transport properties of cement paste are investigated with the aid of fractal theory. Fractal features of cement paste are obtained through the simulated microstructure. Then, fractal models are applied to predict transport properties (permeability, diffusivity and thermal conductivity) of cement paste. In order to verify the fractal models, experimental data and results from other models in literature are adopted to make comparisons, which shows a reasonable consistency and proves the reliability and efficiency of the presented fractal models.
