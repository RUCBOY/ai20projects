The traditional definition of Human-Centered computing refers to the “design, development, and deployment of mixed-initiative human-computer systems”, and mostly refers to the design of computational artifacts. Yet it is bound to be far more than that. The emergence of miniaturized sense, compute and actuate devices as well as interfaces that are form-fitted to the human body opens the door for a symbiotic convergence between biological function and electronic supplemental agents. The opportunities are quasi unlimited, but so are the challenges and the pitfalls. The paper outlines the enabling technologies, and identifies domains where breakthroughs are needed.
