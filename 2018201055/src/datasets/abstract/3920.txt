Traffic hikes exhibits points of instability in computer networks, not to mention congestions and its implications of service disruptions, outages and security holes. Such common failures are becoming a big source of concern for most Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who run services that touch almost every aspect of this smart-based life we are living nowadays. Having the network managed by skilled technicians and professional network engineers is not enough to guarantee a well-defined performance of the provided services. Indeed, an update or even a sudden change and/or failure in a segment of the network may lead to service outages that may take hours to get fixed. This work deploys the theme of Software Defined Networks (SDNs) that decouples the network center of intelligence form the rigid and mostly static hardware side, into a simple more flexible programmable scheme. We built a real SDN network, and proved through experiments its performance and flexibility. Compared with the traditional networks and its rigid management schemes, results proved that SDNs can provide for better performance, and lower costs.
