This paper presents a temperature monitoring system based on Hadoop and visible light communication (VLC). The system includes two parts: temperature acquisition and temperature monitoring. Temperature acquisition section uses visible light communication to transfer temperature data. In the test for temperature acquisition, we used a CMOS camera to receive the temperature data of 20 nodes in the range of 40 meters, which realized efficient transmission of data. The main body of the temperature monitoring section is the Hadoop cluster. Hadoop and its components enable distributed storage and remote monitoring for massive temperature data. Hardware environment of Hadoop is composed of six computers and the software environment is CentOS6.4 operating system based on the Linux 2.6 kernel. In the test of temperature monitoring, we monitored 200 rooms with 1000 temperature sensors in 10 floors totally. The Hadoop platform manages 1000 temperature data records per minute, giving 1.44 million data records a day totally. The data error rate turns out to be within 3% when we added a lampshade to the LED array of VLC transmitter.
