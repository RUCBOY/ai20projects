Gamification nowadays is being one of techniques that can increase motivation and encourage the involvement of users, particularly in education domain that requires teaching and learning activities to be more fun and interesting. This paper surveys some analysis of gamification models. MDA framework is used to identify surveyed papers by breaking them down into three categories: mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics. Findings from the survey show there are many gamification models in education domain. However, there are some very representative gamification models could be used as a method to increase motivation, achievement and engagement in learning activities. By knowing the latest gamification models in education domain stated in this paper, it could help gamification practitioners to make new strategies in learning activities to increase studentsâ€™ motivation, achievement and involvement. We also suggest some gamification strategies, which combine several mechanics in such a way to create dynamics that results in all types of aesthetics outputs.
