Understanding the performance and the response of the frame structures in fire is of a particular importance for structural fire design. The specialized computer program SAFIR enables analysis of different types of structures, constructed with different structural materials. The options of program SAFIR are presented on eight different fire scenarios of standard fire exposure of a three bay two story reinforced concrete frame. The results for the: temperature distribution within the structural elements, fire resistance of the whole structure, bending moments and deformations of elements are presented and discussed. The worst fire scenario of the frame is defined. The higher the fire compartment is, the lower fire resistance of the structure is reached.
