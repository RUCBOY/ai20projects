A model for simulating oil spills in seas is presented in this study. The effects of winds, sea currents, evaporation, emulsification, natural dispersion and seashore interaction have been taken into account. A significant advantage of the model is the possibility of taking into account inhomogeneities in space and the instability at the time of the atmospheric conditions. This model enables the determination of the actual state of oil, including its density, composition and viscosity etc, in both a global, as well as a local (in any point of space) meaning. The frame of the model is based on the discrete particle methodology. To improve the spreading process description, Cellular Automata approach is also applied. A few simulations of oil spills have been performed and described. The results are compared with experimental data and other theoretical outcomes. A high level of accordance is obtained without the necessity of fitting particular parameters.
