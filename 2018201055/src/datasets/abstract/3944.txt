Students generally experience difficulties in learning human body anatomy due to constraints to visualize the body anatomy from 2D into 3D image. This research aims to develop a human anatomy learning system using augmented reality technology. By using this system, it is expected that students can easily understand the anatomy of the human body using a 3D image visualization. The method used in this system is augmented reality marker on mobile computing platform. The marker is captured by taking a picture. Then, the captured image is divided into pieces and the pattern is matched with images stored in the database. In this research, we use Floating Euphoria Framework and combine it with the SQLite database. Augmented reality anatomy system of the human body has features that can interactively display the whole body or parts of the human organs. To evaluate the usefulness of the application, we tested the augmented reality anatomy system with high school students and medical students for learning the anatomy of the human body. The results show that the human anatomy learning system with interactive augmented reality visualization helps students learn human anatomy more easily.
