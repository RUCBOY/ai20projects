This research develops a computer-supported ontology-based Technology Function Matrix (TFM) construction method, called eTFM, as an approach to reduce technology mining man-power and enhance the accuracy and consistency of patent analysis results. The paper addresses a rarely discussed issue of the TFM validation. The proposed validation approach compares the TFMs construction based on both on the domain ontology and the International Patent Classification (IPC) classes. The research demonstrates the methodology's practical applications using the patent analysis case of cyber physical system (CPS), an essential core technology enabling advanced manufacturing and Industry 4.0.
