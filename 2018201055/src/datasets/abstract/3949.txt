The Alzheimer’s disease is one of the top ten causes of death among the elderly. Studies show that there is a significant increase in deaths reported after early 1990s due to the lack of a cure in preventing the disease in modern medicine. Hence, there are numerous attempts made towards managing the progression of the disease which results in improving the wellbeing of the patient. One of the recommended methods of managing it long-term is through providing many memory related activities to the patients. With the limited amount of resources and investments, Sri Lanka is finding it difficult to manage the significant number of patients. Furthermore, not all patients get the opportunity to visit the Alzheimer’s Foundation and receive treatments. This research is a small step towards creating a computer-aided platform for Alzheimer’s patients to improve their livelihood thorough activities focusing on 4As of Alzheimer’s (long-term memory, short-term memory, language and communication skills and fine motor skills) disease under the guidance of clinical Psychiatrists (1). The application is tested with over 75 Alzheimer’s patients under the guidance of their physicians. The comprehensive record keeping for patient condition analysis, gamification-based environment for patients and assistive tool for memory management are among the benefits of this application.
