We have developed low cost interactive 3D models that improve access to architectural details of cultural sites for all, including people with vision impairments. Our approach uses rapid prototyping and 3D printing along with a very small single-board computer for automating user interaction. As a case study, we developed a prototype model of “Piazza dei Miracoli” (Pisa, Italy), the famous square where the Leaning Tower is located. The system is a combination of tactile information with audio descriptions to enable potential users to explore the artifact autonomously. We exploited low-cost and partially open-source technologies, thus rendering our system easily replicable. We evaluated the interactive system with a group of eight completely blind and partially sighted users. Our user test confirmed the validity of our approach: (1) the three-dimensional models and the tactile reproduction of details obtained via a low-cost 3D printing solution are well perceived by touch; (2) the semantic aural information activated via perceptible buttons on demand and the different content levels for the audio tracks are suitable for an interactive, autonomous and satisfying exploration.
