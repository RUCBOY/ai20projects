Image data are considered as significant data in medical systems. The amount of medical image data available for analysis keeps increasing with the modernization of image devices and biomedical image processing techniques. To prevent from being hacked over an insecure network, medical images should be encrypted safely. This study aims at proposing a medical image encryption method based on a hybrid model of the modified genetic algorithm (MGA) and coupled map lattices. First, the proposed method employs coupled map lattice to generate the number of secure cipher-images as initial population of MGA. Next, it applies the MGA to both increase the entropy of the cipher-images and decrease the algorithm computational time. Experimental results and computer simulations both indicate that the proposed method that includes a hybrid algorithm not only performs excellent encryption but also is able to resist to various typical attacks.
