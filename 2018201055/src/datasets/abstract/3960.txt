The present work deals with the effective utilization of plastics generated from E-waste stream. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) collected from the data cable waste and Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) waste materials from the light guidance panels used in the LED screens of computers are used as raw materials in the present investigation. Recycled blend of PVC/PMMA was prepared using mechanical recycling techniques at different compositions via melt blending techniques. The blends were characterized by mechanical, thermal, and morphological studies. The molecular interactions that have taken place between the polymeric materials in the recycled blend have been evaluated using FTIR analysis. The flammability characteristics of the blends were studied by determining rate of burning. The miscibility characteristics in the blends have been studied scanning electron microscopy. Overall stability of the recycled blend improved as compared with its parent recycled materials.
