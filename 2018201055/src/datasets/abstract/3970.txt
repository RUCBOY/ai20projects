Fiber optic is a transmission medium which is currently the most good for data transmits, because it also can be transmitted even voice and video. In most cases a fiber optic network has been implemented using clustering method, where this method assumed inefficient due to the utilization of fiber optic that is not maximized, and the numbers of the Distribution Point used is more. Thus, this paper proposed new design using Voronoi diagrams in selecting the strategic location of the Distribution Point. By utilizing an image from Google map and html code, we created polygons of Voronoi based on the coordinate point of the candidateâ€™s location. The results are getting a value reduction/efficiency in context the use of the Distribution Point is 48%, reduction of unused fiber optics is from 171.23% to 39.72%, and cost efficiency is 50.39%.
