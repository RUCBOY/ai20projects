Human body anatomy becomes an important topic in Biology subject that must be understood since junior high school. Learning materials are mostly available in form of book and anatomy mannequin (puppet), but it is still insufficient enough to help students in understanding human body anatomy. Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that combines a real thing into virtual environment interactively. This research purpose is to develop an AR application for human body anatomy learning to be more interesting and easier for student to understand. This application enables student to learn human body anatomy with 3D object interaction while previously using textbook and mannequin. Research method in for this study is by using quantitative method that collects data and then develops the prototype to prove the impact. Application development method is done by using waterfall method that includes planning (collect data and analysis), design (user interface and diagram), implementation, and testing. Research result is AR application for human body anatomy learning that contains 3D object, organ explanation and position that can be accessible on web.
