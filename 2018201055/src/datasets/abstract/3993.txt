Power plant is one of the substantial industry in a country since it supports various needs of people. Optimum cost for running this industry is a necessity so that power generated can be produce according to power demand with appropriate cost. Economic dispatch is an optimization approach in power system plant with objective function is to minimize cost by finding appropriate arrangement of generator output according electric requirement and capacity of the system. Previous researches have been proposed techniques to solve this problem, however a stable convergence and good computational efficiency is still required. Therefore, this paper proposes bat algorithm to minimize total generator cost from thermal power plant. Bat algorithm is one of nature inspired optimization problem which has advantage in stable convergence. The experiment results show that Bat algorithm is able to save approximately 1.23% compare to the actual cost and 0.12% to firefly algorithm.
