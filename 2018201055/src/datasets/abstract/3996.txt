In recent years, information technology is developing continuously and set off a burst of artificial intelligence boom in the field of science. The development of advanced technologies such as unmanned driving and AI chips, is the extensive application of artificial intelligence. Face-related technologies have a wide range of applications because of intuitive results and good concealment. Since 3D face information can provide more comprehensive facial information than 2D face information, and it can solve many difficulties that cannot be solved in 2D face recognition. Therefore, more and more researchers have studied 3D face recognition in recent years. Under the new circumstances, the research on face are experiencing all kinds of challenges. With the tireless of many scientists, the new technology is also making a constant progress, and in the development of many technologies it still maintained its leading position. In this paper, we simply sort out the present development process of facial correlation technology, and the general evolution of this technology is outlined. Finally, the practical significance of this technology development is briefly discussed.
