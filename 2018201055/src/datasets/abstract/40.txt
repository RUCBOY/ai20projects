Research in computer science and medical applications such as wireless sensor technology is considered one of the most important fields in improving life quality. The purpose of this article is to provide an image of current trends and future directions for the study of continuous injection monitoring of patient wear and human lane systems. The human muscles' size to assess by ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in 6 subjects throughout the body. In both proposed methods (preprocessing, feature extraction, classification), 11 axial scans were taken with the abdominal muscles, and the cross-sectional area of each scan muscle digitized. Muscle mass is calculated by processing the muscles into continuous cones. Explain the important role of this program as a big data human health analysis in wireless sensor, not only in providing high-quality care to people but also in reducing the living needs of the elderly independently from the nursing staff and helping patients with chronic illness. In introducing to propose a comprehensive survey based on the Sensitivity Enhancement based Classification Algorithm (SEBCA) proposed in the most advanced research activities in the country to address this gap and recommended wireless sensor for the large data system. Potential applications, networks and infrastructure technology challenges work together and are explained in terms of research areas and objectives.
