Topological evolution is a ubiquitous feature of complex networks. In a set of coupled networks, either with the same or different types of nodes, the topological evolution of a network may have a profound influence on the others. This work i) reports observations of adaptive topological coevolution between the scientific collaboration and paper citation networks, and ii) proposes a concise framework of modeling the coevolution phenomenon between the interdependent networks. Adaptation to structural evolutions from its counterparts is a crucial topological evolutionary mechanism of a complex network. This work provides a new perspective for a better understanding of the driving forces of topological evolution and may further help with applications, such as link prediction and failure mitigation, in complex networks.
