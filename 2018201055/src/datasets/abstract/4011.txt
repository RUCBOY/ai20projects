Computational algorithms can be described in many methods and implemented in many languages. Here we present an approach using storytelling methods of computer game design in modeling some finite-state machine algorithms and applications requiring user interaction. An open source software Twine is used for the task. Interactive nonlinear stories created with Twine are applications that can be executed in a web browser. Storytelling approach provides an easy-to-understand view on computational algorithms allowing communication with people with no computer science education. It also allows rapid prototyping and testing in mixed background work teams.
