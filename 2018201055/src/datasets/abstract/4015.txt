Effective pain management is an elusive concept in acute care. Inadequate knowledge has been identified as a barrier to providing optimal pain management. This study aimed to determine student perceptions of an interactive computer simulation as a potential method for learning pain management, as a motivator to read and learn more about pain management, preference over traditional lecture, and its potential to change nursing practice. A postâ€“computer simulation survey with a mixed-methods descriptive design was used in this study. A college of nursing in a large metropolitan university in the Southeast United States. A convenience sample of 30 nursing students in a Bachelor of Science nursing program. An interactive computer simulation was developed as a potential alternative method of teaching pain management to nursing students. Increases in educational gain as well as its potential to change practice were explored. Each participant was asked to complete a survey consisting of 10 standard 5-point Likert scale items and 5 open-ended questions. The survey was used to evaluate the students' perception of the simulation, specifically related to educational benefit, preference compared with traditional teaching methods, and perceived potential to change nursing practice. Data provided descriptive statistics for initial evaluation of the computer simulation. The responses on the survey suggest nursing students perceive the computer simulation to be entertaining, fun, educational, occasionally preferred over regular lecture, and with potential to change practice. Preliminary data support the use of computer simulation in educating nursing students about pain management.
