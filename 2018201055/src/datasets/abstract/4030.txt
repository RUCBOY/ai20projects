Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on virtual reality (VR) mostly integrate visual and/or auditory feedback. Haptic feedbackwhich has the potential on improving the feasibility and operability of VR-based BCI systems is rarely explored in previous studies. In this article, we present a novel framework of BCI system based on both visual and haptic feedback, in which users can learn to manipulate the haptic device's stylus for motor training. The effects of motor training with and without haptic feedback are evaluated by detecting and analysing the changes of electroencephalogram (EEG). The preliminary experimental results indicate that haptic feedback may influence the modulation of the beta rhythms over left and right sensorimotor cortex during hand movements. This study can be easily replicated to evaluate the existing systems with haptic feedback and used to develop new applications for motor training.
