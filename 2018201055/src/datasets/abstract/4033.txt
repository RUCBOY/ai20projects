In this paper, an approach to the introductory programming training and its core elements are presented. The main challenge was in suggesting the updates in the introductory training appropriate for students without previous knowledge or experience that will be valuable for their further professional growth. The core curriculum for students in computer science and IT are courses in programming languages and environments. The content, form and teaching method for them should correspond to the state of the art in computer science and industry, taking into account trends in programming languages, technologies, development methodologies. The paper provides a description of changes in content and method of teaching the course “Algorithmization and Programming of Solutions” offered to the first year students.
