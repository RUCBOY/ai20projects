Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are emerging technologies that acquire and translate neural data, applying that data to the control of other systems. Privacy has been identified as an ethical issue possibly arising from the use of BCIs. The research reported in this paper seeks to identify whether BCIs change privacy and if so, how and why. Interim findings are presented before outlining future research opportunities.
