In this paper, we address cross-domain multi-dimensional emotion regression through adversarial learning. This is done via a proper conduction of both dimensional and domanial adversarial learning. On the one hand, we conduct adversarial learning between emotion dimensions via a dimensional discriminator to achieve dimension-specific features through the attention mechanism for better determining dimensional emotion scores. On the other hand, we conduct adversarial learning between the target domain and multiple source domains via a domanial discriminator for better leveraging texts from source domains for regression model training in the target domain. Empirical evaluation on the EMOBANK corpus shows that our proposed approach achieves notable improvements in r-values in the cross-domain multi-dimensional emotion regression task over the state-of-the-art baselines.
