Cognitive neuroscience is being widely explored to develop more interactive brain computer interfaces for control applications. An attempt has been made to translate a cognitive activity (deliberate eye blink) of human subjects captured via electroencephalography (EEG) into action. Channel power spectral and the highest peak related features have been extracted to identify eye blink related instances. A significant rise in event related potential is observed across frontal lobes of cerebral cortex. The developed model has been deployed in arduino using simulink to control output devices independently. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cognitive control network to translate deliberate intentions into commands via EEG based BCI for rehabilitation of physically challenged patients.
