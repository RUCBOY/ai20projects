Computer Science finds a variety of applications in different fields. In the modern scenario, the combination of human senses with field of computer science is becoming more and more common. A detailed study of haptic technology is described in this paper which is entirely related to touch. The complete potential of the field is yet to be explored. The science of applying touch sensation and control to interact with computer developed applications is the best definition given for haptic technology. With the help of Haptic device people get a sense of touch with computer generated environments, so that when virtual objects are touched, they seem to be real and tangible. Haptic technology enables the user to interface with a virtual environment via the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. This mechanical simulation helps in the creation of virtual objects, controlling of virtual objects and to augment the remote control properties of machines and devices. This paper describes how haptic technology works, its devices, applications, and disadvantages. A brief explanation on haptics functions and its implementation in various fields of study is provided in this paper. A description on some of its future applications and a few limitations of this technology is also provided.
