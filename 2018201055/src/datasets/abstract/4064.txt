This paper reports on a computer simulation of plastic deformation of refractory material porous billets when rolling in four-roll-pass mills. This model allows calculating the geometrical, kinematic, and energy parameters of the rolling process accounting for the preset law of porous billet compacting in the deformation zone. The theoretical study of porous billet rolling process using the mathematical model has proved the decrease of billet elongation compared with that of non-porous ones. The computer analysis has shown that in the process of rolling falling of creep value, the rolling force and rolling moment take place. The experimental test of the computer simulation results has shown a good correspondence of main rolling process parameters.
