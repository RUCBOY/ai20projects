The increasing demand for fast and accurate gait-impaired disease diagnosis requires a real-time prediction of gait information in order to enable online information access to determining the disease progression. In addition, the wearable sensor-based information acquisition meets the new trend of take-home healthcare, the access to the great amount of data enables applying data-driven methods in this scenario. In this paper, we propose to use wearable Electromyography (EMG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors to make an ahead-of-motion prediction of basic gait information, including lower-limb kinematics and kinetics. Particularly, a novel long short term memory (LSTM)-based algorithm is trained to extract features and continuously predict lower-limb angles. Based on the predicted kinematics, the kinetics of lower limbs are calculated by a dynamic model of human segments. EMG signals recorded from nine lower limb muscles and IMU signals from each lower-limb segment were collected for training the regressor. The experimental results with cross-validation among ten subjects have demonstrated the accuracy of the angle prediction and kinetics calculation. In addition, the optimal prediction time was exploited by testing the different sets of prediction time. The implication of this research work highlights the potential of continuous prediction of kinematics and kinetics, which provides fast and accurate access to basic gait information for smart healthcare applications.
