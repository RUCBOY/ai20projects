This study investigated the most common challenges of human computer interaction (HCI) while using electronic medical records (EMR) based on the experience of a large Russian medical research center. The paper presents the results of testing DSS implemented in the mode of an additional interface with the EMR. The percentage of erroneous data for two groups of users (with and without notifications) is presented for the entire period of the experiment and the weekly dynamics of changes. The implementation of CDSS in the supplemented interface mode of the main MIS has had a positive effect in reducing user errors in the data. The results of the users survey are presented, showing a satisfactory evaluation of the implemented system. This study is part of a larger project to develop complex CDSS on cardiovascular disorders for medical research centers.
