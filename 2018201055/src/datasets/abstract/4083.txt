Our aim was to assess the accuracy of computer-aided orthognathic surgery for maxillary repositioning in 15 patients with mandibular hyperplasia and normal temporomandibular joints (TMJ). We aligned preoperative and postoperative virtual skulls at the cranium using surface superimposition then recorded and calibrated three 3-dimensional coordinates (maxillary dental landmarks U0, 6R, and 6L) on the skulls. Errors between these preoperative and postoperative landmarks were calculated and the largest error of every patient was chosen for assessment. Landmark errors ranged from 1.00 – 2.49 mm, and recording errors from −0.06 – 0.07 mm. The superimposition error was mean (SD) 0.036 (0.002) mm. The accuracy of the method is acceptable in patients with a normal TMJ.
