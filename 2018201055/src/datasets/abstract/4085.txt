The Cooperative Intelligent Transportation Systems (C-ITS) are one of the most important parts of intelligent transportation support. The possibilities of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication modelling and computer simulation are presented in this paper. The results of V2 V and V2I communications simulation, with regard to expected C-ITS services are shown. Gathered results are evaluated in consideration of current and future communication technologies (VANET, 4G, 5G) capabilities.
