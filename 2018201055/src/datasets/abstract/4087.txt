Existing commercial three dimensional (3D) display technologies for computer screens, such as stereoscopic and auto-stereoscopic methods, are based on binocular parallax theory. Due to the inherent accommodation-convergence conflict, (auto-) stereoscopic displays are always suffering the visual fatigue problem. Through sequentially gating two different segments of each eye's aperture of the viewer and refreshing the display contents simultaneously, a 3D display based on Super Multi-view technology for the computer screen is proposed in this paper, which is free from the accommodation-convergence conflict. Employing custom liquid-crystal-valve array for each eye, a proof-of-concept prototype is set up and a 3D display free from accommodation-convergence conflict gets demonstrated.
