This study aimed to assess the feasibility of professional based conventional speech language therapy (SLT) either alone (Group A/less intensive) or assisted by novel computer based local language software (Group B/more intensive) for rehabilitation in early post stroke aphasia.
Comprehensive Stroke Care Center of a tertiary health care institute situated in South India, with the study design being prospective open randomised controlled trial with blinded endpoint evaluation.
This study recruited 24 right handed first ever acute ischemic stroke patients above 15 years of age affecting middle cerebral artery territory within 90 days of stroke onset with baseline Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) Aphasia Quotient (AQ) score of < 93.8 between September 2013 and January 2016.The recruited subjects were block randomised into either Group A/less intensive or Group B/more intensive therapy arms, in order to receive 12 therapy sessions of conventional professional based SLT of 1 h each in both groups, with an additional 12 h of computer based language therapy in Group B over 4 weeks on a thrice weekly basis, with a follow up WAB performed at four and twelve weeks after baseline assessment. The trial was registered with Clinical trials registry India [2016/08/0120121].
All the statistical analysis was carried out with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows version 21.
20 subjects [14 (70%) Males; Mean age: 52.8 years ± SD12.04] completed the study (9 in the less intensive and 11 in the more intensive arm). The mean four weeks follow up AQ showed a significant improvement from the baseline in the total group (p value: 0.01). The rate of rise of AQ from the baseline to four weeks follow up (ΔAQ %) showed a significantly greater value for the less intensive treatment group as against the more intensive treatment group [155% (SD: 150; 95% CI: 34–275) versus 52% (SD: 42%; 95% CI: 24–80) respectively: p value: 0.053].
Even though the more intensive treatment arm incorporating combined professional based SLT and computer software based training fared poorer than the less intensive therapy group, this study nevertheless reinforces the feasibility of SLT in augmenting recovery of early post stroke aphasia.
