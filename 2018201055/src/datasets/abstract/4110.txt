The paper is devoted to finite element software ACELAN-COMPOS developed by the authors. It presents the approaches to the determination of the effective properties of piezoelectric two-phase composite materials based on the effective moduli method, the algorithms for generating representative volumes with specified properties, and the finite element techniques. Brief description of two algorithms of representative volume generation are provided. One of these algorithms supports connectivity between two phases of the composite, and the other creates inclusions in granular shape as the second phase. The results of calculating the effective moduli of porous piezoceramics with open and closed porosity and the effective moduli of polycrystalline piezoceramics are given.
