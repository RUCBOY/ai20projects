Modeling of air flow over buildings belongs to a challenge that was accepted by several authors. There are couple reasons for it, from which the most frequent is simulation in order to obtain pressure or external pressure coefficients distributions. These simulations are always a balance between accuracy and computer needs and consumed time. Aim of this contribution is to validate Computer Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation by experimental measurement in Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel (BLWT). A low-rise building with gable roof will be examined and results will be compared to wind tunnel test. For the purpose of this simulation were chosen Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) and Scale-Adaptive Simulation (SAS) turbulence models. It is observed that the DDES model failed in predicting pressures around the roof ridge. The average deviations on the gable roof from the BLWT measurements are 37.2% for DDES and 26.7% for SAS model.
