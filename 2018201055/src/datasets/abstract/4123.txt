Our society is rapidly evolving and each individual needs to communicate with their peers â€“ speakers of other languages. The communication competence in various languages becomes thus a requirement. Our paper focuses on a topic less researched by researchers exactly because most times they work individually and not in a multidisciplinary team committed to implement digital technologies in formative teaching. The teaching of foreign languages should be paired in class with computer technologies that involve the use of glottodidactics in order to ease the learning of languages based on the method of discovery through deduction and intuition in the propaedeutic stage. The study presented hereby has been conducted using a group of 1055 participants, from urban/rural areas (459 girls and 381 boys/125 girls and 90 boys), aged over 10 years and with different levels of training. This study clearly reveals the preference of the subjects for learning including the digital technologies and the importance in this process of micro-expressions, gestures, mimics of the body of the teacher, actor / artist or characters. We would like to present here, as well, the motivation regarding the voice adjustment of the digital tool used to prepare the digital workbook/digital production in general, for a better learning of languages and of English and Italian in our case, according to the age and training of beneficiaries.
