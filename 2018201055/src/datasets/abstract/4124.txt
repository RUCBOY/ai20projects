This study investigates, verifies and determines the optimal parameters for the selective thermal transformation of problematic electronic waste (e-waste) to produce value-added copper-tin (Cu-Sn) based alloys; thereby demonstrating a novel new pathway for the cost-effective recovery of resources from one of the world's fastest growing and most challenging waste streams. Using outdated computer printed circuit boards (PCBs), a ubiquitous component of e-waste, we investigated transformations across a range of temperatures and time frames. Results indicate a two-step heat treatment process, using a low temperature step followed by a high temperature step, can be used to produce and separate off, first, a lead (Pb) based alloy and, subsequently, a Cu-Sn based alloy. We also found a single-step heat treatment process at a moderate temperature of 900 °C can be used to directly transform old PCBs to produce a Cu-Sn based alloy, while capturing the Pb and antimony (Sb) as alloying elements to prevent the emission of these low melting point elements. These results demonstrate old computer PCBs, large volumes of which are already within global waste stockpiles, can be considered a potential source of value-added metal alloys, opening up a new opportunity for utilizing e-waste to produce metal alloys in local micro-factories.
