A database of aviation materials and an expert system are developed. They allow performing thermogas dynamic calculations of turbofan engines of various schemes and action principles, automatically create a constructive image of engine main units, calculate the heat, inertial and gas-dynamic load, to evaluate heat, inertia and gas-dynamic load working on the elements of the engine air-gas channel, to estimate strength and carry out the selection of the main parts materials of an aircraft engine and the assembly unit. This article describes an example of a fan blade simulation; add compressor stage and a high pressure compressor of PS-90A turbofan engine. It is compared to the real engine design with the design proposed by "AM" program. The weight of a working fan blade is defined; the computation of the static strength is performed and the variants of materials are selected to be used in designing the investigated blades. Application of "AM" program allows optimizing their design and greatly reducing the design stage and products finishing.
