In the present study, the levels of alkylphenols (APs) and alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs) in indoor dust of three different microenvironments were measured and daily intake via dust ingestion estimated. Alkylphenols and alkylphenol ethoxylates were extracted with the aid of sonication and analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry after heptafluorobutyric anhydride derivatization. The concentration values of these pollutants ranged from 1918–10 935 ng g−1; 343–12 438 ng g−1 and 1122–15 324 ng g−1 in dust samples from homes, computer laboratories and offices, respectively. In all the microenvironment studied, di-NPE and mono-NPE were the most abundant isomers suggesting widespread use of NPE-based consumer products in the studied microenvironments. The daily exposure dose (DED) was estimated using min, mean and max concentrations of APs and APEs detected in respected microenvironments. The worst case scenario for the exposure of APEs was highest for toddlers at 146 ng kg−1 bw day−1 followed by teenagers at 11.3 ng kg−1 bw day−1 and adults at daily exposure of 8.53 ng kg−1 bw day−1. Though the daily exposure doses are low, there is a cause for concern as these surfactants are not regulated in many developing countries and their use may be increasing.
