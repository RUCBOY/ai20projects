This study was aimed at the development of a non-intrusive, biosensor based, Adaptive Interface Design (AID) that utilizes its users' physical abilities (rather than focusing on their disabilities), while simultaneously honoring their integrity and needs. The target users for this study were patients with arthritis in the hand. The AID comprises of eye tracking and data glove technologies, the latter of which will be used to measure the user's physical ability as it translates hand gestures into computer controls. By developing accessible computer interfaces and exploring their use for telerehabilitation purposes, we want to ultimately impact the inclusion and health outcomes of those who experience disability on a daily basis.
