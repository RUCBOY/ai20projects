PSICO-A is a computer system for teaching Psychology. It is especially indicated for secondary school students and students in first year of a Psychology degree. It is an innovative system as it is the first integrated computational system designed for teaching educational psychology units. PSICO-A integrates various tools and educational influences: it introduces concept maps, free recovery of memory, an effective mechanism of “feedback”, simulations and digital games and looks into the student's metacognitive abilities. Its computational architecture is modular and integrates an analyzer that helps the teacher to collect data. We have evaluated this system, confirming a significant improvement in a lot of learning variables.
