In this paper, we present a detailed, expert knowledge based Virtual Reality model of Nikola Tesla's laboratory in Long Island (Wardenclyffe), New York, USA. From our knowledge, this is the first virtual reality reconstruction of the abandoned laboratory and the projects main purpose is to revive some conditions in which the scientist was inventing and to bring closer Tesla's patents to the population worldwide. The research is done in cooperation with the “Nikola Tesla Museum” in Belgrade, Serbia, which heritages original legacy of the scientist. Stereoscopic modelling is performed by analyzing old grayscale photographs, blueprints and other original artefacts available to the Museum, as well as today's sight condition whereas static modelling is performed using software Autodesk Maya while rendering is performed using Unreal engine. The complete, improved, developing pipeline is also presented and over 50 single wireframe models, including Nikola Tesla's patents, are described.
