The use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is growing significantly for many and varied purposes. During the mission, an outdoor UAV is guided by following the planned path using GPS signals. However, the GPS capability may become defective or the environment may be GPS-denied, and an additional safety aid is therefore required for the automatic landing phase that is independent of GPS data. Most UAVs are equipped with machine vision systems which, together with onboard analysis, can be used for safe, automatic landing. This contributes greatly to the overall success of autonomous flight.
This paper proposes an automatic expert system, based on image segmentation procedures, that assists safe landing through recognition and relative orientation of the UAV and platform. The proposed expert system exploits the human experience that has been incorporated into the machine vision system, which is mapped into the proposed image processing modules. The result is an improved reliability capability that could be incorporated into any UAV, and is especially robust for rotary wing UAVs. This is clearly a desirable fail-safe capability.
