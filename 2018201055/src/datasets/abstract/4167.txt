The aim of this study is to test the effect of a concrete way to use practical exercises in a human-computer interaction course. Our approach is focused on lab sessions, replacing typical concrete exercises with realistic projects based on collaborative work, long term duration (the whole course instead of concrete labs) and multidisciplinary design interacting with real end-users. The realistic projects approach supports the practice of theoretical concepts together with professional skills development, e.g. social skills needed to interact with end-user without technical background. In order to assess this approach we have conducted a comparative study with three different groups involving 133 students. Two groups followed the realistic projects approach, the difference between them was end-users recruitment. End-users were recruited by teachers in one group and by the students in the other. The third group followed the typical approach. Our comparative study is based on students' motivation. We have chosen the Situational Motivation Scale as the measurement instrument. Results show that, independently from the end-user recruitment, students involved in realistic projects are significantly more motivated than students involved in the general approach. Thus, students involved in realistic projects perceive that these activities are useful or important for them.
