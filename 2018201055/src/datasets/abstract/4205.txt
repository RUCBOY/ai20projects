Quality of education can be enriched with better outcome in undergraduate (UG) computer science and engineering program with the introduction of High Performance Computing (HPC) courses into the UG curriculum. The paper gives the background of the author’s institution, processes of curricula enhancement, infrastructure development to enable students to carry out the work and records the students’ achievements academic year wise. The paper also discusses the evolution and continuous upgrading of the HPC courses along with the issues and challenges experienced. The paper gives the details about the courses along with the process of teaching and evaluation. It lists the students’ research achievements with a focus on HPC, for each academic year. Although the paper has focused on UG HPC education for the past seven academic years, the author also provides additional information about HPC subjects introduced to postgraduate (PG) students of computer science and engineering at various levels in the academic year 2015–16. The paper aims to serve as reference for those faculty and students who wish to introduce similar HPC courses at their schools by making use of the best practices that helped us in providing better inputs to our students to attain laudable results.
