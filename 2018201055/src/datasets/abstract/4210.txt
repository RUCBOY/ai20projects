This effort is to bring the results of numerical experiment to resolve a problem of projectileâ€™s penetration into hybrid (sandwich) armor panel with absorbing layer made from discrete elements.
Modeling was performed at two scales. Deformation of each discrete element was considered in terms of continuum approach, the hybrid armor panel was represented by a big number of discrete elements with the given law of interaction. Numerical experiment consisted in variation of micro porosity of Al form damping particles and variation of projectile shape and velocity as well as a variation of material and shape of discrete reinforcing elements.
