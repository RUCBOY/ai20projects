Reproducibility is a desirable characteristic of any experimental work in computer science. In this paper, we reproduce the results in the paper, “A parallel connectivity algorithm for de Bruijn graphs in metagenomic applications”, for verifying their claims on the speed and scalability of their algorithm. We first state the claims made in the original paper. Then, we describe our hardware and software setup used for the reproducibility task, followed by the steps taken to setup the proposed algorithm and profiling software. Lastly, we present the results obtained from our experiments and show that we are able to reproduce most of the claims made in the original paper.
