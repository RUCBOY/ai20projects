Distance education systems have become more prevalent over time and their use continue to increase. Learning Management Systems (LMS) is the main component for distance education to be carried out effectively and distantly. In this stuy, it is aimed to examine current studies on LMS published between 2010 and 2014 and provide an instructive source for researchers. The obtained data were analyzed and interpreted based on certain criteria. According to the results, LMS studies are mostly published in Computer & Science Journal, however there is a decline in the number of studies in 2014. Results also showed that researchers mostly conducted studies with university students and they examined the systems either developed by themselves or by an institution. It was revealed that Moodle is mostly used as open source code systems and WebCT (Blackboard) is mostly used as commercial. It can be indicated that seeking for new LMS by researchers would change based on the requirements and technological advances in the further research.
