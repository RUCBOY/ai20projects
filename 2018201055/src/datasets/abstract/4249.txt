Empirical evidence suggests the effectiveness of robotics as a learning complementary tool in tertiary education. In this context, some experiences benefited from the link between educational practice and theory. However, a comprehensive survey on initiatives that explores this link in universities and colleges is missing. This work systematically reviews quantitatively assessed robots applications, grounded in learning theories, in tertiary institutions. By applying a protocol review in different bibliographic databases, 15 papers were selected for synthesis. As a result, experiences developing non-robotic concepts and skills in universities and colleges were found. In most of the cases, Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate courses were involved. In addition, empirical results reported by the selected publications suggest that some literature proposals can be useful in practice. Based on the panorama obtained, this work also points out future directions for practitioners and researchers in education.
