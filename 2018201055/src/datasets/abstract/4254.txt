A novel brainâ€“computer interface work is proposed for the applications of virtual reality in telemedicine and telecommunication in this study, in which the aim is to enhance the interactions between the humans and computers with virtual reality technologies. The system mainly contains automatic artifacts removal, feature extraction, significant feature selection and classification. A similarity measure approach is proposed to automatically remove the artifacts, which effectively reduce the influence of artifacts and simultaneously achieve higher accuracy. The artificial bee colony algorithm is used to select significant sub-features from feature combinations, which further greatly enhance the classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system performs better than several state-of-the-art approaches. It is also recommended that it is suitable for the applications of virtual reality in telemedicine and telecommunication.
