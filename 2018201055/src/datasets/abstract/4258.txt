Molecular dynamics simulations of the different self-assembled structures based on the β-cyclodextrin and adamantane were performed. The line shift and non-uniform broadening of the T1→S0 transition of naphthalene molecule inserted into these structures were calculated. It was found that line width is mainly governed by the nearest-neighbor environment. The most important factor was the existence of the typical “sandwich” structural pattern. The main findings provide a way to the rational design of new materials for nanophotonics.
