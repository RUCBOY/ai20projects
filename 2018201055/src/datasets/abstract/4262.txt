The paper presents four most advanced computer science perspective initiatives aiming for the mind understanding and replication of its functions. The second goal of the paper is to introduce a hybrid architecture based on multiagent system and real-time control units organized in multiresolution layers. Collaborative functional specialized modules implemented as agents solve complex tasks. The agent society deployed as cloud provides an on-demand runtime agent instantiation in order to compete or cooperate with others during the problem solving process. Complex tasks decomposition leads to hierarchical specialized agent structures which fulfill the goal by collaboration. The purpose is to offer a generic framework for research of neurocognitive domains like perception, learning, memory.
