The work concerns the numerical prediction of deformations in welding of two rectangular profiles using TIG method. Numerical analysis of thermomechanical phenomena are carried out in the Abaqus FEA software using finite element method. Geometry of the joint is numerically recreated on the basis of the real welded joint of rectangular profiles. For this geometry a discretization of the system and numerical simulations of welding deformations are performed. The calculations are performed for the rectangular profiles made of steel X5CrNi18-10. Numerical analysis takes into account thermomechanical properties of welded elements changing with temperature. DFLUX subroutine is used in Abaqus software, allowing the modeling of moveable welding heat source. Mathematical Goldakâ€˜s description of the heat source is assumed to described the distribution of movable heat source power. Results of numerical analysis of the temperature distribution in the welded joint are presented in this study. The estimation of the shape and size of melted zone is performed as well as the prediction of stress state and welding deformations. Numerically predicted deformations are compared with results of the measurement.
