The mobile games for education and entertainment are rapidly developed. Unfortunately the development of interesting and entertaining adaptive multiplayer game based learning for math and science that consider psychological aspects and game balancing for students on mobile platforms that have game balancing is very limited. This paper proposes an integrated model of adaptive Math and Science game based learning for elementary school students with adjustable level of difficulty based on user’s ability and additional option for “Free” and “Adventures” modes. We propose a method where level of difficulty can be adjusted based on previous score, using fuzzy two inputs in the form of percentage correct and the speed of answer to produce output. The experimental results are presented and show the adaptive games are running well on mobile devices based on Android platform and well received by elementary school students grade 3 to 6.
