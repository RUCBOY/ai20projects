Combination of tool and work piece material has a very significant role for surface finish in turning operation. There are many different types of tool inserts with different material and tool insert geometry which are used in turning operation for good surface finish. This paper describes an optimal procedure to select best tool insert from various tool inserts for better surface finish in turning operation. Multiple Attribute Decision Making methods is been used in various areas such as society, economics, military, management, manufacturing etc., and is been receiving more and more attention over the last few years.In this research work, three work-piece materials i.e., EN 8, SS304 and EN 19 and three tool inserts i.e., 1) DVJNR 2020K 16-VBMT 16 04 08 MF, 2) WNMG 08 04 08 MF- MWLNL 2020K 08, 3) PDJNR 2020K 15-DNMG 15 06 08 MF are taken. The right choice oftool insert-work piece material is VBMT 16 04 08 MF and EN-8 for better surface finish. A tool insert selection index is provided that evaluates and ranks the tool insert for good surface finish in turning operation.
