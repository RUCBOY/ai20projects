Metal ion levels are used as a surrogate marker for wear in hip resurfacing arthroplasties. Improper component position, particularly on the acetabular side, plays an important role in problems with the bearing surfaces, such as edge loading, impingement on the acetabular component rim, lack of fluid-film lubrication, and acetabular component deformation. There are little data regarding femoral component position and its possible implications on wear and failure rates. The purpose of this investigation was to determine both femoral and acetabular component positions in our cohort of mechanically stable hip resurfacing arthroplasties and to determine if these were related to metal ion levels.
One hundred fourteen patients who had undergone a computer-assisted metal-on-metal hip resurfacing were prospectively followed. Cobalt and chromium levels, Harris Hip, and UCLA activity scores in addition to measures of the acetabular and femoral component position and angles of the femur and acetabulum were recorded.
Significant changes included increases in the position of the acetabular component compared to the native acetabulum; increase in femoral vertical offset; and decreases in global offset, gluteus medius activation angle, and abductor arm angle (P < .05). Multiple regression analysis found no significant predictors of cobalt and chromium metal ion levels.
Femoral and acetabular components placed in acceptable position failed to predict increased metal ion levels, and increased levels did not adversely impact patient function or satisfaction. Further research is necessary to clarify factors contributing to prosthesis wear.
