In recent decade, a wave of apprehension swept across the Pearl of Oriental with regards to the disappearance of high value tangible and intangible heritages due to urban renewal and redevelopment. The flourish of computer science and engineering, however, offers a rosy spectacle for heritage preservation. Virtual heritage is no longer an idea in cloud-cuckoo-land. In this research paper, we propose the ground breaking five dimensional GIS virtual heritage. Whilst traditional two dimensional GIS stores the information of X and Y axis, the recent three dimensional GIS includes the information of building height and other information is useful to urban planners when they make decision in change in use of land. The fourth dimension includes time with collective memories of Hong Kongers. The invaluable intangible heritage can be kept by record of oral history. Changes in ethnic minorities, different walks of lives provide dazzling and interesting angles of the modern city. We also include the concept of the fifth dimension of automated virtual and augmented heritage with drone and robotsâ€™ help in taking 360 degree virtual reality videos and photos. Whilst strand of literatures on VR, AR, 3D GIS and memories scatter in different areas of research, combination of all these technologies is the first of its kind. Research on automated VR and AR is scarce or non-exist. It is expected that the 5D GIS virtual heritage offers a new angle to historian, economists, sociologists, urban planners.
