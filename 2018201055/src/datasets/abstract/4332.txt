In this research, the researchers apply the roles of variables visualization to the teaching of novice C language programmers. The results are evaluated using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy. The participants of the research were fifty-five undergraduates who major in computer science at a polytechnic institute. They were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students from the control group learned programming in the traditional role-based teaching method. The students in the experimental group learned programming using variables visualization with the support of PlanAni and generic integrated development environment (IDE). For the purposes of determining the effects of the role-based visualization teaching, the SOLO level of the code writing was graded according the SOLO categories for program construction. A course satisfaction questionnaire was conducted. Data analyses show there was a significant improvement of SOLO level of program construction and a higher approval about the roles of variables. These results indicate that visualizing the roles of variables with animations and IDE can provide novices with a new conceptual framework that enables them to design relational program from a holistic point of view and helps them learn the concept of the roles of variables.
