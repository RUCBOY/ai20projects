This study presents a science mapping approach to analysing the thematic evolution of the e-Government field. We combine different bibliometric tools to analyse the evolution of the cognitive structure of this research topic, allowing us to discover the dynamics over different years and detecting the most prominent, productive, and highest-impact subfields. Science mapping provides a novel perspective to reveal the scientific frontiers and dynamic structure with visualization methods. Findings indicate symptoms of a research field in constant evolution that has not yet reached a stage of maturity, and specially, in the following areas of study: smart cities (provision of public services), e-Participation (political area) and technologies used and citizen's acceptance (technological tools).
