The age at which a patent yields maximum price remains under explored. This paper attempts to demystify the patent age-price relationship using 510 US patents sold in US auctions. Results show computer and communication singletons sold during second half of their life (âˆ¼after10 years 2 months) exhibit significantly higher price than those sold before. No such relationship came significant for the portfolios sold. Further, age-price relationships are analysed with different bundling strategies composed of different patent family types and others, and technology fields as controls. The paper concludes with discussing the managerial implications.
