According to the science and technology a neural network is a computer system modeled on the human brain and nervous system. Neural network model represent complex input/output relationships. Neural network is formed by inter connecting the number of nodes to process the information. A Neural network is designed using computer system which works like a human brain.
Sometimes the computer may fail to perform certain actions .Then we try to perform the same action by using human brain. To avoid this type of problems we are using FUZZY-LOGICS in computer systems to make decisions like human brain.
In this paper we are trying to present the concepts related to neural networks and Fuzzy logics and how neural networks are associated with the Fuzzy logics. This paper also presents the Fuzzy logic applications in the real world and also focuses on the applications of the fuzzy logics that are used across the world in different ways. Neural networks, Computational intelligence techniques, intelligent control, instrumentation and robotics include Fuzzy logics to perform the action in easier and different way to perform in better manner.
