Systems involving fluid flows are commonly found along the energy value chain and are most of the time complex. Having good understanding and control are essential to warrant the system performance. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a unique tool which predicts fluid flow phenomena using numerical algorithms. It gives access to non-measureable variables and allows the visualization of fluid flow patterns.
With the rapid advancement in computer sciences, it is now possible to handle most industrial processes involving fluid flows with CFD. The scope of application is large and issues that can be addressed are numerous, from process design validation and optimization to management of operational conditions changes to troubleshooting.
The application of CFD in troubleshooting will be highlighted through a few example of studies conducted by ENGIE Lab, on upstream natural gas treatment systems to downstream industrial end-use for combined heat and power plant and petrochemical furnace.
