IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that is needed by developers to write sourcecode for computer programming is also starting to shift from desktop to web platform. As implemented in the cloud, Web IDE (WIDE) can be accessed online through browsers and on mobile devices. WIDE takes many advantages and becomes popular in recently years. Unfortunately, there is no tool found yet in currently WIDE to support translating novice programmers’ algorithm into programming language before they become experts in techniques of writing computer programs. This study goal is to design a tool to support novice programmers’ early learning of programming before they step into coding, compiling, running, and debugging in WIDE. Software development method used in this study is Rational Unified Process (RUP). Conclusion of this study is block-code tool can help novice programmers to learn programming language in early phase, and motivate them better.
