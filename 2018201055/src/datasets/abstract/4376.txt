Accountants have modeled and documented accounting information systems (AIS) through system flowcharts, which have also been used to study internal controls. However, when AIS are large, complex, and distributed, their system flowcharts are difficult to comprehend, challenging to use, and insufficient to support decision making in system design and implementation. In this primer we propose a set of requirements for modeling and documenting complex AIS that address those concerns. Since most other models such as SSAD, UML, and BPMN used to represent AIS are influenced by or can be reduced to Petri net models, we compare system flowcharts with Petri net representation of AIS. We evaluate systems flowcharts and Petri nets for their suitability in modeling AIS. We find that Petri nets are an attractive alternative due to their extensive capability to perform analytics and simulation. Analytics can be used to study structural and behavioral properties while simulations can help study run-time behavior of systems to evaluate computing capacity and system performance. We provide a detailed description and guidelines of how design analytics and implementation analytics can be achieved based on the Petri net framework. With this unified modeling strategy, we also describe how it can support the process of audit analytics. Petri nets are popular in computer science, engineering, manufacturing, supply chain management, and business process reengineering. We explore this viable method for rigorous study of AIS modeling and documentation.
