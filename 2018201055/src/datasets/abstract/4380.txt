This paper broaches the issue of using 2D tracking algorithm frameworks on mobile devices in order to enable cooperative repair tasks in robot-operated industrial production. A local service technician can be supervised remotely by an external expert in the context of telemaintenance. At first we introduce several tracking libraries and test them on low-performance mobile devices. After that we conduct a test run on a large amount of pictures derived from video streams with different characteristics of the application area of industrial maintenance and repair operations in order to find the best suited algorithm. At the end we describe the implementation on several mobile devices and delay considerations.
