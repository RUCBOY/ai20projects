Science and technology domains are facing a diversity of challenges enforcing ICT professionals to transfer and aggregate knowledge from different subject areas. This article discusses the creation of the educational environment in supercomputer simulations in the framework of three double-degree Master’s programs in Applied Mathematics and Informatics (Computational Science). These programs (BigData and Extreme Computing, Urban Supercomputing, and Computational Biomedicine) where developed by ITMO University, Russia, in partnership with University of Amsterdam (UvA), the Netherlands. Having critically reviewed the place of ICT master’s programs in Russia and abroad, we base our training methodology on the diversification of global academic and professional activity of master students by immersing them in research projects. Mastering professional, cultural, and engineering competencies during the learning process in multidisciplinary learning environment, we know we will enable our graduates to use effectively computing systems of different architecture and apply a variety of programming techniques, as well as promote the formation of creativity, emotional intelligence and after graduation to be apt to professional mobility.
