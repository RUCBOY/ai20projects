Advanced building materials are nowadays an active research domain. The integration of traditional materials and technologies in the field of electronics, photonics and computer science are leading to a new class of smart components that provide advanced functionalities and enable original applications.
The LUMENTILE H2020 EU funded Project aims at the integration of existing and state-of-the-art technologies in the domain of large area electronic circuits, LED based lighting, embedded systems and communication. These technologies are blended with advancements in the manufacturing of ceramic tiles to obtain a new building component that can be managed as a common tile, while providing the possibility to self-illuminate and to sense the neighbor environment by means of dedicated sensors. The applications of these new material and technologies include indoor and outdoor architectural design, smart environments (also targeting improved safety and security issues), smart and high-efficiency lighting and art installations. State-of-the-art advancements are expected in the field of large area circuits and successful integration of heterogeneous materials, mainly focusing on ceramics and electronics.
