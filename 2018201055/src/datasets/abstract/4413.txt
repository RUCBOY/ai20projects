This paper puts a finer point to remote telemaintenance with asynchronous access to an industrial production plant and its data. At first, the condition monitoring records the data from the industrial manipulator and transfers it via the Internet to an application. One possible applications for this data, which can run remotely in order to analyze and to optimize the plant and its processes is a complex sensor view with video integration of one plant cycle (application “FADAT” Facility Asynchronous Data Analysis Tool). Research focus of this paper lies on the user side: The goal of this work is to provide the external expert with a better understanding of the plant and its processes. This is realized for the first time in the examined work environment.
