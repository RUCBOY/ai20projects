Optical Character Recognition is one of the popular area in artificial intelligence and pattern recognition area. Generally, this technique converts the input image into an editable format in computer. This paper uses several techniques as a comparison for some extracted features, such as: zoning algorithm, projection profile, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and combination of those feature extractions ( zoning + projection, projection + HOG, zoning + HOG, zoning + projection + HOG). For the evaluation of the proposed system, this paper compare the most commonly classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). This experiment achieves the highest accuracy of 94.43% using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with the feature extraction algorithms are:projection profile and the combination of zoning + projection profile
