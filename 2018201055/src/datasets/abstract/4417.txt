Traditional navigation guidelines for desktop computers may not be valid for mobile devices because they have different characteristics such as smaller screens and keyboards. This paper aims to check whether navigation guidelines for Personal Computers are valid or not for mobile devices. To do this, firstly an evaluation was carried out by a group of advisors with knowledge in web design, and then empirical studies were conducted with real mobile devices and users. Results show that most of the traditional navigation guidelines are valid for current mobile devices, but some of them are not, which suggests that a similar process is necessary to validate traditional guidelines for mobile devices. The final result is a set of fifteen navigation guidelines for mobile web sites, from which eleven are totally new because they have not been previously suggested by any standard or recommendation for mobile web sites.
