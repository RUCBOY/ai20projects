The purpose of this study is to determine use of Web 2.0 tools (frequency of using Web 2.0 tools, duration of access to social networks, intentions for using Web 2.0 by prospective science teachers) and to investigate the relationship between the use of these technologies and biotechnology literacy. The study was designed as a correlational research. The sample consisted of conveniently selected 101 prospective science teachers at the senior level. Data was collected by “Biotechnology Literacy Test” and “Survey of Web 2.0 Technology Use”. The data was analyzed by Pearson correlation test and calculating frequencies. Findings showed that the prospective science teachers mostly preferred to use Web 2.0 tools for fun. They also preferred to use the tools for exchange of knowledge, reaching current resources, and web-based learning and research. Moreover they used social networks to follow daily news. Also prospective teachers use social networks mostly to follow the current events. The participants rarely preferred to use social networks to follow education clubs, to make research for their projects and homework as well. As the other aspect of this study, the relationship analysis showed that level of the participants' biotechnology literacy were positively correlated with time of using internet, frequency of using social networks, frequency of using blogs, wikis, and instant messaging system, and duration of being a member of a social network.
