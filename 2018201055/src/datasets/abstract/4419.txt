The aim of this study is to examine the Moodle features that are implemented in the Moodle version used at Kajaani University of Applied Sciences. Using the qualitative weight and sum (QWS) approach, a sample of 30 university lecturers were surveyed on their responses to Moodle usage. The paper intended to discover what features are mostly adapted and used by the lecturers. The Moodle learning management system implemented at KAMK includes 12 features for creating activities and six features for adding resources that are investigated in the paper. The measurement criteria of the Moodle features in the paper are considered subjective and qualitative. The author used 6 symbols for 6 qualitative levels of importance for the weights of features: E = essential, * = extremely valuable, # = very valuable, + = valuable, | = marginally valuable and 0 = not valuable. The result of the evaluation shows that Moodle is generally used for delivering course content, course progression plan, grading, creating activities, collecting course feedback and communicating with course participants. Among several features, only a few of them such as assignment, feedback, quiz and workshop modules are considered very essential and are heavily used.
