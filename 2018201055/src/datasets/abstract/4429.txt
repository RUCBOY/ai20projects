This study is accomplished from the educational needs assessment in the framework of educational research. The objective is to identify, analyse and assess human resources and materials. In this sense, didactic principles will also form part of the analysis. In particular, those applied in studies offered by the Social Sciences Faculty of the National University of Costa Rica (SSF) to implement blended courses based on the blended learning model. Quantitative and qualitative research techniques were used to gather information from a complementary approach, in order to describe and interpret the different sources. That process included three phases: document review; surveys done to students and teachers; structured interviews to school principals and deanship. The results show there are appropriate curricular elements to venture into innovation proposals regarding academic offer in terms of flexibility and ICT incorporation in training programs. Likewise, the blended learning is an option which contributes to the quality of education, access opportunities and the educational processes improvement.
