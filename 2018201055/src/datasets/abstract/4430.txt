Secure Simple Pairing protocol of Bluetooth introduced in Bluetooth version 2.1+EDR has security issues. Shared secret key using Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman algorithm generated in public key exchange phase, is subsequently used for authentication of devices and for computing Link key. The stability of Elliptic-Curve-Diffie–Hellman is based on the determination of order and structure of a finite Abelian group and computation of Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm (ECDLP) in a cyclic group. An algorithm for a quantum computers exists, that can figure out the inverse of Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm in polynomial time. Therefore, it demands a safe and sound cryptosystem for quantum computers. A revision to boost the security of pairing and authentication process in the Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) protocol of Bluetooth intended for classical and quantum computers is proposed called as Classiquantum Resistance Secure Simple Pairing protocol. On simulating the proposed protocol, it is studied that the proposed protocol is superior over SSP, as far as security performance by enhancement of key strength and by wrapping link key with two R-LWE secret key, is concerned.
