Recent technological developments have fueled a shift toward the computerization and automation of factories; i.e., Industry 4.0. Unfortunately, many small- and medium-sized factories cannot afford the sensor-embedded machines, cloud system, or high-performance computers required for Industry 4.0. Furthermore, the simple production processes in smaller factories do not require the level of precision found in large factories. In this study, we explored the idea of using inexpensive add-on triaxial sensors for the monitoring of machinery. We developed a dimensionality reduction method with low computational overhead to extract key information from the collected data as well as a neural network to enable automatic analysis of the obtained data. Finally, we performed an experiment at an actual spring factory to demonstrate the validity of the proposed algorithm. The system outlined in this work is meant to bring Industry 4.0 implementations within grasp of small to medium sized factories, by eliminating the need for sensors-embedded machines and high-performance computers.
