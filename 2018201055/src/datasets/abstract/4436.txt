This paper addresses the problem of estimating continuous boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable engineering design parameters in complex engineering applications. In particular, a procedure is proposed to reduce the computational cost of finding and representing the boundary. The proposed methodology combines a low-discrepancy sequence (Sobol) and a support vector machine (SVM) in an active learning procedure able to efficiently and accurately estimate the boundary surface. The paper describes the approach and methodological choices resulting in the desired level of boundary surface refinement and the new algorithm is applied to both two highly-nonlinear test functions and a real-world train stability design problem. It is expected that the new method will provide designers with a tool for the evaluation of the acceptability of designs, particularly for engineering systems whose behaviour can only be determined through complex simulations.
