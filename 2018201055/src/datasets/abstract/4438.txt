Sierpinski graphs constitute an extensively studied class of graphs of fractal nature applicable in topology, mathematics of Tower of Hanoi, computer science, and elsewhere. A large number of properties like physico-chemical properties, thermodynamic properties, chemical activity, biological activity, etc. are determined by the chemical applications of graph theory. These properties can be characterized by certain graph invariants referred to as topological indices. In QRAR/QSPR study these graph invariants has played a vital role. In this paper, we study the molecular topological properties of Sierpinski networks and derive the analytical closed formulas for the atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index, geometric-arithmetic (GA) index, and fourth and fifth version of these topological indices for Sierpinski networks denoted by S(n, k).
