Network embedding aims to learn the low-dimensional representations for the components in the network while maximally preserving the structure and inherent properties. Its efficiency has been proved in various real-world applications. However, most existing studies on attributed networks cannot explore both the multi-typed attributes and the semantic relationships flexibly. To address the above problem, we propose a deep model based embedding learning method for attributed networks, named DeepEmLAN. It can smoothly project different types of attributed information into the same semantic space through a deep attention model, while maintaining the topological structures. Furthermore, we design a heuristic combining strategy to generate the final embeddings, which makes the nodes sharing more neighbors, similar text-enriched or labeled attributes closer in the representational space. To demonstrate the potential of the proposed DeepEmLAN, we evaluate its performance on the challenging tasks of node classification and network reconstruction. The experimental results on several real datasets have shown that DeepEmLAN outperforms competitive state-of-the-art methods significantly.
