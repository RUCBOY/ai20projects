Security warning is a form communication between user and computer to inform the users on the risk of allowing random applications to run on the computer system. Security warning is designed to warn the users such as notify, inform and advice users about the consequence effect of an action. However, computer user s tend to ignore security warning due to the lack of attentions, did not understand the meaning of the warnings, difficulties on the technical jargon used, lack of motivation and users become habituated to security warning. Therefore, a survey was mounted online utilising 156 participants to investigate and to understand further general understanding of user’s perceptions on security warnings. This paper describes two main findings utilising Chi-Square and Cramer’s V test. The findings suggested that in all three scenarios, the results were not statistically significant. However, results portrayed in Cramer’s V test were in a better outlook. The result indicates on the need to look closely on each variable involves within the study sampling to improve the security warnings.
