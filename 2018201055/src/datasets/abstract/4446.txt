When people talk to each other, eye contact is very important for a trustful and efficient communication. Video-conferencing systems were invented to enable such communication over large distances, recently using mostly Internet and personal computers. Despite low cost of such solutions, a broader acceptance and use of these communication means has not happened yet. One of the most important reasons for this situation is that it is almost impossible to establish eye contact between distant parties on the most common hardware configurations of such videoconferencing systems, where the camera for face capture is usually mounted above the computer monitor, where the face of the correspondent is observed. Different hardware and software solutions to this problem of missing eye contact have been proposed over the years. In this article we propose a simple solution that can improve the subjective feeling of eye contact, which is based on how people perceive 3D scenes displayed on slanted surfaces, and offer some experiments in support of the hypothesis.
