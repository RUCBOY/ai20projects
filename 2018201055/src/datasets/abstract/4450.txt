Recent advent of the tunable lasers made to measure simultaneous temperature and concentration fields of the gases. CT-TDLAS (computed tomography-tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy) is one the leading techniques for the measurements of temperature and concentration fields of the gases. In CT-TDLAS, the accuracies of the measurement results are strongly dependent upon the reconstruction algorithms. In this study, four different reconstruction algorithms have been tested numerically using experimental data sets measured by thermocouples for combustion fields. Three reconstruction algorithms, MART (multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique) algorithm, SART (simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique) algorithm and SMART (simultaneous multiplicative algebraic reconstruction technique) algorithm, are newly proposed for CT-TDLAS in this study. The calculation results obtained by the three algorithms have been compared with previous algorithm, ART (algebraic reconstruction technique) algorithm. Phantom data sets have been generated by the use of thermocouples data obtained in an actual experiment. The data of the Harvard HITRAN table in which the thermo-dynamical properties and the light spectrum of the H2O are listed were used for the numerical test. The reconstructed temperature and concentration fields were compared with the original HITRAN data, through which the constructed methods are validated. The performances of the four reconstruction algorithms were demonstrated. This method is expected to enhance the practicality of CT-TDLAS.
