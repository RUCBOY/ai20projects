Simulation studies are gaining in popularity and are used in many scientific fields. Implementing computer solutions in production engineering allows reducing costs that an enterprise incurs due to erroneous decisions while planning and modernising production lines. This is also helpful in the reduction of the time required to develop plans for manufacturing new products. This problem is important in manufacturing companies that seek to reduce the volume of stocks while ensuring the continuity of the production process. The article presents possibilities of applying computer simulation models in studying chosen production scenarios. The basic methods of research used in the study were literature studies and computer simulation.
