Simulation of age progression of 3D head models is an open problem in the field of computer graphics. Existing methods usually require a large set of training data, which may not be available. In this paper, a method for aging simulation of models created by deformation-based modeling is proposed that requires no training data. A user defines the position of wrinkles by selecting the position of endpoints of the desired wrinkles and the wrinkles are then generated using an erosion-inspired approach. The method can be used to simulate aging of any head model, however, if used for models created by deformations of a base model, the erosion factors can be calculated only for the base model and applied to the derived models. The results show that the approach is capable of creating visually plausible aged models.
