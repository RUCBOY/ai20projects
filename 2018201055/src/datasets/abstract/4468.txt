Even though many algorithms have been developed and many applications of object tracking have been made, object tracking is still considered as a difficult task to accomplish. The existence of several problems such as illumination variation, tracking non-rigid object, non-linear motion, occlusion, and requirement of real time implementation has made tracking as one of the challenging tasks in computer vision. In this paper a tracking algorithm which combines mean-shift and particle-Kalman filter is proposed to overcome above mentioned problems. The purpose of this combination is to draw each algorithmâ€™s strength points and cover each algorithms drawbacks. In the proposed method, mean-shift is used as master tracker when the target object is not occluded. When occlusion is occurred or the mean-shift tracking result is not convincing, particle-Kalman filter will act as master tracker to improve the tracking results. Experimental results of the proposed method show desirable performance in tracking objects under several above mentioned problems.
