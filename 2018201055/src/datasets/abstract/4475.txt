L1-regularized multiway canonical correlation analysis (L1-MCCA) has been introduced to reference signal optimization in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP)-based brainâ€“computer interface (BCI). The effectiveness of L1-regularization on significant trial selection highly depends on the regularization parameter setting, which can be typically determined by cross-validation (CV). However, CV will substantially reduce the practicability of BCI system due to additional data requirement for the parameter validation and relatively high computational cost. To solve the problem, this study proposes a Bayesian version of L1-MCCA (called SBMCCA) by exploiting sparse Bayesian learning. The SBMCCA method avoids CV and can efficiently estimate the model parameters under the Bayesian evidence framework. Experimental results show that the SBMCCA method achieved comparable recognition accuracy but much higher computational efficiency in contrast to the L1-MCCA method.
