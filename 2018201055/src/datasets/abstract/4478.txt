In classrooms, light levels are directly related to energy consumption; due to the use of artificial lighting. Hence, this study aims to improve the visual comfort and energy efficiency in existing classrooms, by investigating various retrofit methods for passive daylight techniques, in northerly oriented classrooms at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST). Data of this research are obtained using computer simulation and real measurements. The combination of the clerestory window and the anidolic ceiling directed toward the south provided about 62% of the lighting level required in the classroom, and it decreased the energy consumption required for lighting, heating, and cooling by 16.3%.
