The excellent features of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless technology enthuses researchers to apply advanced and complex techniques on mobile communication networks, which is what this paper explores. As a result of the ability of 6G to exchange vast data rates and network programming, the Cooperative Network Coding (CoNC) technique can be implemented to improve the connectivity and diversity within 6G applications.
Though CoNC is usually implemented at the second stage, this paper proposes dividing the first stage into two Half-Cycle stages, and then applying CoNC at the second Half-Cycle stage. The resulting Bit Error Rate (BER) behaviour is investigated on the physical layer for direct data exchange in 6G local mobile networks over an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Partial Unit Turbo Code (PUTC) (4,2,1,4) and (8,4,3,8) are used by each mobile node as the forward error correction technique, which means that each mobile acts as a Base Station (BS) for other mobiles in the local network by applying CoNC on the received packets, and then each mobile node (or BS), either Amplify-and-Forward (AF), or Decode-re-encode-amplify and Forward (DF), acts. When full connectivity is not achieved at the end of the first two Half-Cycle stages, new Half-Cycle stage transmissions follow, and the BER behaviour for all additional Half-Cycle stages is obtained. The results illustrate that applying CoNC at the second Half-Cycle stage of the first general stage produces a limited BER loss. To mitigate the damage in the BER, a soft-decision PUMTC decoder is also proposed.
