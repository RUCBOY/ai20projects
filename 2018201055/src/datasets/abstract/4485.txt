In crime investigation, especially in computer crime investigations, seizure and analysis of digital evidence is a de facto standard procedure. To prevent alterations on the original digital evidence a so called (bitwise) image is created. In this image all data contained on the digital evidence is stored, even non-relevant content or content with the risk of associated privacy violations. In countries with an elaborate protection of private personal or confidential data, this data has to be securely deleted from the image. Facing the rising request for a selective deleting functionality, common problems, limitations and requirements for a tool selectively deleting non-relevant data are outlined in this paper. For demonstration purposes, a prototype as a plugin for the Digital Forensics Framework (DFF) was implemented. The design of the implementation, some considerations as well as a comparison between a commercial tool and the evaluation of the implemented wiping strategy are presented.
