The government of Extremadura proposed the introduction of a computer for every two pupils in state secondary schools since 2000. With the project Escuela 2.0, the aim of the Ministry of Education in Extremadura is providing each class with a digital blackboard and each student with a lap top computer from their first to their last year at secondary schools. Given the enormous cost of this programme, it is imperative that schools make the best use of ICT. Our study therefore, was designed to find out whether this was so and if not why not. We chose as subjects of the study English language teachers in the province of Badajoz, based on the hypothesis that any problems which might arise with the implantation of the plan would be found principally in the negative attitudes of teachers involved. This work aims at establishing the reasons for the failure to normalize the use of computers in the English language classroom analyzing in depth the data proceeding from the interviews carried out among sixteen teachers of English from public and private Secondary Schools.
