Complex computer systems and electric power grids share many properties of how they behave and how they are structured. A microgrid is a smaller electric grid that contains several homes, energy storage units, and distributed generators. The main idea behind microgrids is the ability to work even if the main grid is not supplying power. That is, the energy storage unit and distributed generation will supply power in that case, and if there is excess in power production from renewable energy sources, it will go to the energy storage unit. Therefore, the electric grid becomes decentralized in terms of control and production. To deal with this change, one needs to interpret the electrical grid as a system of systems (SoS) and build new models that capture the dynamic behavior of the microgrid. In this paper, different models of electric components in a microgrid are presented. These models use complex system modeling techniques such as agent-based methods and system dynamics, or a combination of different methods to represent various electric elements. Examples show the simulation of the solar microgrid is presented to show the emergent properties of the interconnected system. Results and waveforms are discussed.
