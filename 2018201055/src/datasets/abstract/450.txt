The preliminary STAR data for proton cumulants for central collisions at s=7.7GeV component proton multiplicity distribution. We show that this two-component distribution is statistics friendly in that factorial cumulants of surprisingly high orders may be extracted with a relatively small number of events. As a consequence the two-component model can be tested and verified right now with the presently available STAR data from the first phase of the RHIC beam energy scan.
