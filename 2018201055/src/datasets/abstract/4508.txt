Breast cancer (BC) mostly develops on women breast region. Regular check ups are crucial for early detection and treatment of this cancer type. Pathologist performs the diagnosis of the breast cancer. Recent computer-aided methods for breast cancer diagnosis allow another and faster way of breast cancer diagnosis. Therefore, improvement of computer-aided methods has been developing for the breast cancer detection. In this paper, a method for automatic classification of images for breast cancer diagnosis is presented. Classification of the images is achieved using Back Propagation Neural Network (BPPN). The performance of the automatic classification of the breast cancer images is further improved by using radial basis neural networks (RBFN). The accuracies of the BPNN and RBFN are also reported 59.0% and 70.4% respectively.
