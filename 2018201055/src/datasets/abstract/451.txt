We present a method, based on conformal mapping, to generate top-hat line-shaped beams. The familiar Cartesian to log-polar coordinate transformation and additional amplitude modulation are combined to transform an input beam with a circular symmetry into a straight line with a uniform intensity distribution. We implement an experiment by using a spatial light modulator and computer-generated holograms as optical elements for unwrapping and phase correction. An optical system consisting of a cylindrical lens and an interferometer with two dove prisms is additionally employed to improve the quality and aspect ratio of the top-hat profile. Numerical simulations and experimental results are presented to evaluate the proposed technique quantitatively. The obtained results demonstrate that the amplitude-modulated log-polar transformation not only effectively converts any input beams with a circular symmetry but also can produce a top-hat line-shaped focus with steep edges and a high aspect ratio.
