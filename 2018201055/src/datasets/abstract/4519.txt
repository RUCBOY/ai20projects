Special transport (for example ambulances, fire trucks, police cars) can ignore rules of the road in some cases. Modern transport models simulate the movement of conventional vehicles. However usually modern models donâ€™t take into account, for example, ambulance moving onto oncoming lane. We need data about special transport moving for developing effective models. In this work we described a methodology, which can be used for obtaining data about special transport moving onto oncoming lane and road traffic from road cameras video. Methodology includes computer vision methods for vehicle moving detection. We demonstrate the work of our method in the task of analyzing the data of road cameras in St. Petersburg.
