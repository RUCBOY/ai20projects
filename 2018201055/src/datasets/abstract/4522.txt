To process rapidly growing Big Data, many organizations migrate their data and services such as e-voting and e-payment systems to the cloud. In these two systems, blind signature has become an essential cryptographic primitive since it allows the signer to sign a message without learning what he signs. Thus, it can guarantee trustworthy of Big Data. However, most blind signature schemes based on factoring and discrete logarithm problems cannot resist quantum computer attacks. The alternative blind signature schemes are based on lattice. Here, we present a round-optimal lattice-based blind signature scheme constructed on the closest vector problem using infinity norm. Firstly, our scheme is proven blind and one-more unforgeable, and is resistant to brute-force attacks, theoretical-timing attacks, and Nguyen–Regev attacks. Secondly, our scheme outperforms the RSA, the Schnorr, and the ECC blind signature schemes in terms of efficiency and security. Also, it outperforms the Rückert’s blind signature in terms of signature length, moves, and security. Finally, our scheme outperforms the Rückert’s blind signature in terms of communication and computation energy costs. Additionally, it outperforms the RSA blind signature in terms of communication energy cost.
