In present computer structures in view of distributed data centers (DC) provides flexible management of network topology and functions in real time. This method allows to get rid of the excess costs of expensive equipment and network service. To provide resiliency of network infrastructure of DC it is necessary to use effective fast rerouting algorithms. In this work we propose adaptive rerouting algorithm of data flows in distributed DC based on the paired shifts data.
