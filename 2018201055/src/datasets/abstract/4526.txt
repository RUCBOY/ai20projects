Complex networks play a very important role in various fields of science as data structures, which aggregate information about mutual relationships between numerous objects. The structural properties of these large graphs can be scrutinized throughout their interactive visualization. However, visual analysis of complex networks consisting of |V| ∼ 106+ vertices represents a great challenge for nowadays computer systems both from computational and storage perspective. Therefore, the existing graph drawing methods involving greater than O(|V|) time and space complexity cannot be regarded as promising tools in the advent of the Big Data era. We present here a new and very fast graph drawing method with O(|V|) time and space complexity – ivga (interactive visualization of graphs). We evaluate its usefulness and performance by testing ivga on the large complex networks from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection. We demonstrate that ivga allows for very fast interactive visualization of large graphs consisting of up to a few million vertices on a regular laptop what makes it very competitive to other state-of-art graph drawing methods. Particularly, we recommend ivga method for interactive visualization of large non-planar complex networks such as small-world and scale-free social networks. The main concept of ivga can be seriously considered in developing tools for visualization and analysis of really huge networks, with billions of vertices and edges, on Big Data systems.
