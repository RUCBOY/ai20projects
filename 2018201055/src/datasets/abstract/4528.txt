Sierpin´ski-like graphs constitute an extensively studied family of graphs of fractal nature applicable in topology, mathematics of the Tower of Hanoi, computer science, and elsewhere. In this paper, some indexes related to degree of the Sierpin´ski-like graphs have been researched. Using special structure and correlation of Sierpin´ski-like graphs, the radii, Randic´ index, Zagreb index, sum-connectivity index and metric dimension of some Sierpin´ski-like graphs are obtained.
