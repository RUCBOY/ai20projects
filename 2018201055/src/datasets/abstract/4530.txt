We present our experience in the application of a new cybernetic system, TRIK, for control engineering education at university level. The TRIK system is composed of an embedded controller, analogue and digital input-output interface and an inertial measurement unit which can be easily programmed with visual and text based computer languages. The system can be efficiently used for robotic and control engineering prototyping and education. In the present paper, we describe and discuss various applications of the system in education covering basic control theory problems and advanced robotic system development. Our experience with TRIK has demonstrated that the developed system and corresponding curricula improves the efficiency of control engineering education at university level, and has significant potential to promote science and technology at secondary school level.
