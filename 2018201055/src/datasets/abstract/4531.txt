Classical approaches to material synthesis rely on experimental results obtained by academicians and practitioners during a long period. However, a huge amount of data containing complex relationships mandates the use of computer-guided methods of material synthesis. Big data driven knowledge based models and other computational schemes allows to alternate hard experimental works. Such approaches provide ability of systematic and computationally effective analysis in order to predict composition, structure and related properties of new materials.
In this paper we apply the fuzzy set theory to knowledge mining from big data on material characteristics. We propose fuzzy clustering-generated If-Then rules as a basis for computer synthesis of new materials. Validity of the proposed approach is verified on an example of prediction properties of Ti-Ni alloy.
