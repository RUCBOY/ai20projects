Floating booms are useful tools in the marine world, especially for marine demarcation where some kind of contamination of sea, ocean or coastal water is present. In this work we have developed a mathematical model for a flexible floating boom which is hooked on two boats (unmanned surface vehicles). It is meant to be used for oil spill containment in marine areas. In order to simplify the model and to make possible its computer simulation, we have adopted a quasi-static approximation where we assume that the inertial forces are small compared to the drag forces applied to the boom. The simulation of this mathematical model has allowed the analysis of the behavior of the floating boom. Based on this knowledge, we have designed a control system which allows us to maintain the flexible floating boom in a specific configuration by controlling its shape. For that purpose, the control approach deals with the speed of the two ends of the floating boom. The results obtained with the implemented control system are encouraging, considering the model is a simplified discrete one and the control effort is reasonable.
