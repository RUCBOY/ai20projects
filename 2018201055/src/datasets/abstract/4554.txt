There are some rules for 3,000 V DC electrification in the network ruled by the Spanish Railway Infrastructure Authority (ADIF). As far as we know, the correction of the installations is nowadays manually checked by an expert, as expert systems were verified years ago. We propose a computer tool that is an aid for the expert in checking that the positioning of the insulators, circuit breakers, load disconnectors, feeders, etc. fulfills the requirements established. The computer tool allows the expert to automatically check the sections fed in the different scenarios proposed in the requirements. We have found no comparable work in the literature (moreover, this work applies the Spanish railway specifications). In fact, the second author works in a railway electrification company and this work addresses a real world need. Therefore, this is, as far as we know, a novel application.
