This paper examined the determining factors in decisions of citrus farmers on adoption of computers and Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS). Primary data were collected from a random representative sample of 98 citrus farmers from the state of São Paulo, Brazil. The data was analyzed using logit and count data (Poisson regression) models, which enabled testing hypotheses on the effect of ten variables on the decisions of farmers. The results of the logit model showed that education and production size had a positive and statistically significant effect on the adoption of computers, while experience had a negative effect. The adoption and intensity of use of FMIS were influenced positively by overconfidence in management, production size and use of technical assistance. Contract adjustments and farmers’ experience have a negative impact on the adoption of FMIS. The results confirmed the main hypotheses and can contribute to the development of new strategies for greater diffusion of FMIS in Brazilian citrus industry, which is relevant to increasing farm efficiency.
