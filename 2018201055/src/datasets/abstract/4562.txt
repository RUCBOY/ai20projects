In this presentation we discuss the evolution of simulation from its origin in design of computer and communication systems based on event routines, to the conceptualization of the objects under study as systems, to the behavior generation of DEVS models representing a wide variety of cyber-physical forms. Indeed, the history of computer simulation programming languages parallels, and is intertwined with, the evolution of programming concepts from hardware-dependent binary scripts to successively more abstract model-based generic frameworks.
