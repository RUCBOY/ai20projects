In this paper I briefly relate the life and research endeavors of the late Oleg Yurievich Moiseev (January 6, 1959 - June 29, 2016), Candidate of Engineering and a senior researcher at the Image Processing Systems Institute of the RAS - who had unique skills in techniques for fabricating computer-aided diffractive optical elements and recording micro- and nano-optical reliefs. I describe the methods for diffractive microrelief synthesis he authored, outlining the practical uses of the optical elements and devices created by him.
