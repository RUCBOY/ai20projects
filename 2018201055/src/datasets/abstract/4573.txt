With the rapid development of computer industry, the computer performance is seriously restricted by the energy consumption and heat dissipation of high heat flux chip. The increase in high density server racks makes the power supply and the heat dissipation more complex. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the computer chip cooling technology. In this study, heat pipe was used to enhance the cooling performance of CPU. Different forms of heat sink embedded with heat pipe were adopted, and the heat dissipation and energy saving performance were studied. Consequently, the cooling performance can be enhanced with the new cooling technology, and the energy consumption can also be reduced in order to make the CPU work at normal operation temperature, due to high efficiency heat dissipation technology.
