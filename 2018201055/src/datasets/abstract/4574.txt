We present two concrete methods for the computation of the Choquet integral of a positive measurable function. Both methods are based upon the truncation and the discretization of the function involved, the second method being associated with an iterative topological procedure. Computer aided procedures (with preassigned precision), illustrating the aforementioned methods, are introduced.
