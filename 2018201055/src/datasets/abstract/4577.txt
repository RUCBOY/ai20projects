Agent behaviors in simulation systems are related to fundamental capabilities of realistically developing (semi) autonomous navigation actions. This is particularly important when dealing with the implementation of Computer Generated Forces (CGFs) for simulation systems in tactical military training applications. Moreover, these systems take into consideration the particularities of the domain-specific simulation tasks and the numerous heterogeneous CGFs inserted on them in order to generate better knowledge and learning experience to simulation system users. Based on these reasons, this paper reviews recurrent navigation problems as to propose a task-oriented and parameterized (semi) autonomous navigation framework to deal with CGF navigation needs in military simulation. Combining global and local navigation techniques, and controlled transition between alternative degrees of navigation autonomy, the framework aims to overcome the challenges of implementing customizable CGF navigation behaviors and, at the same time, to allow interaction with both users and other simulation systems in distributed simulation settings. A case study is presented in which the proposed techniques are analyzed in a domain-specific simulation problem providing evidence of their suitability to address the studied military simulation problems.
