The aim of this study is to analyze the validity of a computer vision-based method to estimate 3D L5/S1 joint moment during symmetrical lifting. An important criterion to identify the non-ergonomic lifting task is the value of net moment at L5/S1 joint. This is usually calculated in a laboratory environment which is not practical for on-site biomechanical analysis. The validity of the proposed method, was assessed externally by comparing the results with a lab-based reference method and internally by comparing the estimated L5/S1 joint moments from top-down model and bottom-up model. It was shown that no significant differences in peak and mean moments between the two methods and intra-class correlation coefficients revealed excellent reliability of the proposed method (>0.91). The proposed method provides a reliable tool for assessment of lower back loads during occupational lifting and can be an alternative when the use of marker-based motion tracking systems is not possible.
