The paper analyses the statistics of emergency collisions of passenger trains with obstacles, which took place on the major railroads both Russia- and world-wide; evaluates the consequences of the emergency situations; and proposes the ways of increasing the passive safety of the passenger railway rolling stock. The actual methods of investigating the dynamic loading of vehicles while having longitudinal emergency collisions are analyzed, their advantages and disadvantages are revealed. A simulation of a passenger train emergency collision with a truck at an unregulated railroad crossing is investigated using the developed space solid state computer dynamic model, the dynamic forces appearing in the intercar connections are measured, the elements of the train enduring the biggest load are determined. The recommendations on decreasing the dynamic load of the rolling stock during collisions are made based on the simulation results.
