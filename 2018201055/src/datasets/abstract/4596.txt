Cracking which occurs during the solidification process is a serious defect in castings and welds. Alloys are susceptible to cracking during solidification. Al alloys, stainless steels and Ni-base alloys are notable examples. Cracking takes place in the semisolid region called the mushy zone. During solidification, shrinkage and thermal contraction of the mushy zone and its surrounding solid are hindered, tensile deformation can induce cracking (in the semisolid region) along grain boundaries that are not fed with sufficient liquid phase. The cracking criterion is focused on events occurring at the grain boundary, including separation of grains from each other, lateral growth of grains toward each other, and liquid feeding between grains. The susceptibility factor of a binary aluminum alloy to cracking during solidification was also described. The criterion has an effect upon: (a) the lateral growth rate of two neighboring grains toward each other to bond together to resist cracking, and (b) the length of the grain-boundary liquid channel through which feeding has to occur to resist cracking. In future work the criterion will be compared with experimental data and computer simulation during solidification of binary aluminum alloys in welding.
