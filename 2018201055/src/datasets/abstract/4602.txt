Advances in agent-based systems lead to using multi-agent simulations for various areas: computer games, training systems, buildings design, human behavior studying etc. In the same time due to the globalization, many of such systems have to perform more and more agents. One of the consequences in such circumstances can be increasing of computational time for navigation providing. To address the problem, in this article described approach of calculating navigation fields by using OpenCL technology.
