In this communication, an electromagnetic software developed to work in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments is presented. The software is mainly based on the Finite Element Method (FEM) making use of a number of numerical techniques developed by its authors including its own family of higher-order curl-conforming elements and a non-standard mesh truncation methodology for the analysis of open region problems such as those of scattering and radiation. The code is written in FORTRAN 2003 and it adopts from scratch parallel programming paradigms such as Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP). It also includes an in-house development to ease the use of remote computer systems and HPC environments. Initially designed for single-user multicore machines and small cluster environments, a number of modifications have been included in the code in order to make it capable of running on large-scale computer systems and hence, be able to deal with larger problems in terms of number of unknowns. Details of the implementation are shown. Numerical results obtained on an HPC system corresponding to the analysis of a few illustrative challenging problems are also shown.
