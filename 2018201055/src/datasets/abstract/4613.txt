Recently more and more universities have been incorporating HPC (High Performance Computing) in their computing curriculum. The Bio-Grid REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Site offers undergraduate students interested or experienced in HPC a summer research opportunity to participate in projects that apply HPC in various life-science disciplines. The projects are associated with the Bio-Grid Initiatives conducted at the University of Connecticut. Training seminars are designed to equip students with background knowledge such as basic parallel programming, large-scale data analytics, and middleware support, etc., as well as some ongoing projects using these computing methods. Students participate in several collaborative projects supported by a campus-wide computational and data grid. The REU project introduces such interdisciplinary research work to students in the early stage of their academic career to spark their interest. The project aims at preparing future software engineers to formalize and solve emerging life-science problems, as well as life-science researchers with a strong background in high-performance computing. The Bio-Grid REU Site was supported by the National Science Foundation from 08–10 and 12–14, with a website located at http://biogrid.engr.uconn.edu/REU.
