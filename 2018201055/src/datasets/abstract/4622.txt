Accurate detection and segmentation of cell nucleus is the precursor step towards computer aided analysis of Pap smear images. This is a challenging and complex task due to degree of overlap, inconsistent staining and poor contrast. In this paper, a novel nucleus segmentation method is proposed by incorporating a circular shape function in fuzzy clustering. The proposed method was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively using the Overlapping Cervical Cytology Image Segmentation Challenge - ISBI 2014 challenge dataset comprised of 945 overlapping Pap smear images. It achieved superior performance in terms of Dice similarity coefficient of 0.938, pixel-based recall 0.939 and object based precision 0.968. The results were compared with the standard fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering, ISBI 2014 challenge submissions and recent state-of-the-art methods. The outcome shows that the new approach can produce more accurate nucleus boundaries while keeping high level of precision and recall.
