Reforms in science education emphasize learning outcomes of elementary students; it is important to prepare elementary teachers to teach reformed-based science. This study interviews twenty elementary preservice teachers who participated in four discipline-specific science teaching methods courses to become elementary science specialists. This study asks: Why do elementary preservice teachers want to specialize in science teaching? And, how do the they narrate change in their identities following enrollment and through the progression of one or more courses? Using an identity lens, we find that discipline specific experiences and practice develops teachers' ability to see themselves as reformed-based elementary science teachers.
