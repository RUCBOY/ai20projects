In order to solve the problems of manual judgment and low automation in traditional fault diagnosis methods, a fault diagnosis and remote detection system based on infrared images is designed. The computer server of this system realizes the analysis and processing of the infrared image of the insulator by calling the MATLAB software, and transmits the diagnostic data to the Android mobile phone. Simulation results show that the system is effective and convenient.
