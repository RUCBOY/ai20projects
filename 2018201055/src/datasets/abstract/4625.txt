A new watermarking algorithm based on genetic algorithm (GA) in the transform domain is proposed. Unlike the existing computer-generated integral imaging based watermarking methods, the proposed method utilizes GA searching to the optimized transform domain to serve as a trade-off for watermark embedding. In this paper, 3D scene to be captured by using a virtual pinhole array and be computationally recorded as an elemental image array (EIA), watermarking with GA optimization and computer-generated holography is implemented. In the proposed GA optimization process, we utilize the fitness function to improve the visual quality of watermarked images and the robustness. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm yields a holographic watermark that is imperceptibility to human eyes and robust to standard watermarking attacks. A comparison of the proposed watermarking method to the existing similar watermarking methods demonstrated that the proposed method generally outperforms completing methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness.
