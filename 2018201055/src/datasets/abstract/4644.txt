In this paper, we describe the parallelization of three complex and computationally intensive modules of GRASS GIS using the OpenMP application programming interface for multi-core computers. These include the v.surf.rst module for spatial interpolation, the r.sun module for solar radiation modeling and the r.sim.water module for water flow simulation. We briefly describe the functionality of the modules and parallelization approaches used in the modules. Our approach includes the analysis of the module's functionality, identification of source code segments suitable for parallelization and proper application of OpenMP parallelization code to create efficient threads processing the subtasks. We document the efficiency of the solutions using the airborne laser scanning data representing land surface in the test area and derived high-resolution digital terrain model grids. We discuss the performance speed-up and parallelization efficiency depending on the number of processor threads. The study showed a substantial increase in computation speeds on a standard multi-core computer while maintaining the accuracy of results in comparison to the output from original modules. The presented parallelization approach showed the simplicity and efficiency of the parallelization of open-source GRASS GIS modules using OpenMP, leading to an increased performance of this geospatial software on standard multi-core computers.
