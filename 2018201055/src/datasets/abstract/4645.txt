Nowadays, manufacturing systems transform themselves to become Factories of the Future (FoF) that is to say highly flexible, rapidly adaptable to external changes and aiming for a high degree of sustainability. This trend has generated several research streams that we analyse in this paper through a deep bibliographical review. This review leads us to conceptualize 3 main approaches: Computer Integrated Manufacturing, role of human work force and other integration approaches. A potential issue identified within the research is the interplay between computer-based and organization based approaches to manage the dynamic interactions among product, processes and production systems. The conclusions and orientations of future works are thus outlined to support the development of this co-evolution perspective for the successful transformation of Factories.
