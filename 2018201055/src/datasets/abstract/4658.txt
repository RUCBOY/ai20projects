Predatory magazines are created by unreliable publishers who, after collecting a fee, publish the submitted paper in the Open Access (OA) formula without providing substantive control. For the purpose of “encouraging” authors to submit their work, they often impersonate existing periodicals by using a similar-sounding title, a similar webpage, and copied names of editors of the editorial board. They also offer credits close in name to the Impact Factor. The purpose of such activity is to deceive authors and to earn money in an unfair manner. This contribution presents mechanisms used by such journals and includes suggestions for protection from the duplicity and the subsequent disappointment of publishing, often for an exorbitant fee.
