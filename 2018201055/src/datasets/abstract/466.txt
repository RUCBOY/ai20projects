Water quality was highly affected by common pollutants. Metals, pesticides and small molecules are ubiquitous pollutants. Advancement in engineering technology (computer-based monitoring systems) increased the efficiency of quantifying toxicity of different chemicals in an organism. The cardiovascular system reflects internal and external stress of an organism, and electrocardiogram (ECG) data reliably measure external stress. As ECG data can accurately reflect the physiological conditions of organisms, and zebrafish (Danio rerio) are considered to be good models for cardiovascular research, it is hypothesized that ECG parameters of zebrafish could indicate the toxicity of water-borne chemicals. To achieve this, we treated zebrafish with different concentrations of target chemicals (CuSO4, C10H19O6PS2 and NH4Cl) for 48Â h and ECG data were measured. P-wave, R-wave, T-wave, PR-interval, QRS-complex and QT-interval data were the focus of this study. The results of self-organizing maps and Pearson correlation analysis indicate that the QRS-complex can be used as an indicator for CuSO4 stress. The QT-interval could be used to assess the C10H19O6PS2 stress. The QT-interval and P-wave can be used to evaluate the NH4Cl stress. Responses of zebrafish ECG parameters were identical with other vertebrate model, and were specific to toxicant types. It is proved that zebrafish heart ECG index could be used as a potential indicator in early detection of environmental stress.
