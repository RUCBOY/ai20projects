This paper describes LeBonGeste, a device consisting of a basketball basket equipped with sensors, actuators and computers to create a so called augmented basket. It is used to train beginner players to the free throw by helping them to achieve the right stance. Thanks to the Kinect depth-sensor, the system delivers realtime feedback to the player. LeBonGeste has been showcased two times indoor and outdoor using different communication channels for feedback: visual (screen or LED strips) and audio. Developed as an interactive installation for training by entertaining, the system will be tested soon on basketball courts with experienced players.
