In this paper, the optimization of transmission system of electric drive tracked vehicles is studied. The purpose of optimization is to obtain maximum transmission efficiency. The research content in this paper includes two parts: theoretical analysis and computer simulation. The theoretical analysis is to determine the factors that affect the efficiency of the transmission system. The computer simulation is to optimize the actual transmission mechanism to obtain maximum transmission efficiency. The research methods in this paper can help the designer to determine the parameters and the optimal control strategy of the transmission system. The result of this paper has applied value to the design of transmission mechanism of electric drive tracked vehicles.
