The analysis of urban freight traffic is a difficult research area, due to the following major reasons: a big number of factors that prevent a clear definition of its characteristics and lack of data regarding the traffic flows, classification of vehicles, vehicles routes etc. The above influence on problem with analysis of the efficiency of urban freight transport measures. Computer simulation could be significant helpful in this area. The main objective of this paper is to introduce usability of cellular automata as the tool for simulation of traffic in urban freight transport systems. The basis of the analysis will be the example of utilization of loading/unloading bays. Presented simulation will help to analyse the efficiency of this measure as well as its potential influence on city environment.
