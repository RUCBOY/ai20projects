Quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is the promising applicant in nanotechnology for next generation computers. QCA is a very low power, very high speed and extremely dense technology that is used for implementing any computer architecture scrambles binary logics over the configuration of charges amid quantum dots. Numerous studies about multiplier and adder have been anticipated in QCA, while QCA divider design and implementation is a less explored area. Since divider is the basic component of the arithmetic logic unit, thus it has a great impact on the performance of central processing unit (CPU). The widely used algorithms in divider are restoring, non-restoring some of them also used the Goldschmidt iterative division algorithm in QCA, but there is no work reported which has the implementation of the divider based on Taylor series algorithms. We have presented the divider based on a Taylor series expansion algorithm in QCA. The divider has the advantage of time -saving compared to existing dividers.
