Surveillance videos and footages are the primary sources of evidence for any event or crime in the court of law. However, with the rapid advent of low-cost, computationally cheap video manipulating software and tools, video manipulation has become a no-brainer task today. This introduces a major challenge in authenticating the sanctity/originality of videos before they can be produced in the court, or used in other sensitive application domains. In this paper, we propose a digital forensic technique to detect inter-frame forgeries in surveillance videos. The proposed technique utilizes compressed domain video footprints i.e, prediction footprint variation and variation of motion vectors in videos, for the purpose of video forgery detection and localization. Through this work, we identify the type of forgery that has taken place in a video. We have performed experiment over 43 authentic and 720 inter-frame forged videos. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed technique performs consistently efficiently, irrespective of the group of pictures length and degree of compression in videos.
