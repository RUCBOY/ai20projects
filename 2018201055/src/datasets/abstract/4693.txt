Initiative distribution of oil products to gas stations in urban area is an Inventory Routing Problem (IRP), which is difficult to be modeled and solved on line, in real-time and dynamically. In order to achieve effective distribution plans of oil products in real-time to ensure precise distribution, this paper applies a knowledge-based tree-like representation for IRP in the oil products distribution system, and illustrates its application principles with an instance. This method facilitates computers to fast searching and reasoning and guarantees scientific, efficient and intelligent modeling and solving of IRP for obtaining distribution plans in real-time.
