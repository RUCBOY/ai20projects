Distribution patterns/performance of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) was visualized by computer simulation and experimental validation on agarose gel tissue-mimicking phantom (AGTMP) models. The geometry of a complex three-dimensional mathematical phantom model of a cancer tumor was examined by tomography imaging. The capability of mathematical model to predict distribution patterns/performance in AGTMP model was captured. The temperature profile vs. hyperthermia duration was obtained by solving bio-heat equations for four different MNPs distribution patterns and correlated with cell death rate. The outcomes indicated that bio-heat model was able to predict temperature profile throughout the tissue model with a reasonable precision, to be applied for complex tissue geometries. The simulation results on the cancer tumor model shed light on the effectiveness of the studied parameters.
