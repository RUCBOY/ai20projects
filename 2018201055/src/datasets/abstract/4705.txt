Impact bar is the key part of buffer bed for long distance conveyor equipment which has the characteristics of high energy absorption, low friction, product spillage and scattering elimination. The state-of-the-art and the application of the impact bar and metal matrix composites (MMCs) are introduced. The paper emphatically explained the impact bar structure and integrated process, new theories and computer aided development in the buffer investigation. The main concerns for the impact bar include: structure composition, performance index and key technology; damping technology, laser texturing and genetic algorithm in the simulation and optimization; computer aided design, analysis, testing and manufacturing process in the development of impact bar. Furthermore, the manufacturing standard, quality control and data mining for the impact bar design is urgent to exploited in the future.
