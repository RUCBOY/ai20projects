The purpose of this study is to introduce a new technique for quantifying the non-uniformity parameters of temperature and concentration fields. This technique, non-uniformity coefficient (NUC), based on uniform design theory is illustrated by using numerical modeling of microchannel heat sinks with complex structure and computer experiments combined with image analysis. Based on the statistical analogy of star discrepancy, it takes into account the time space and position information (TSPI) of objective. Some of the methods reported in the literature are not found to be able to better characterize and rank very general class of temperature fields correctly. Effectiveness of the new method is also demonstrated on the open imaging data of concentration fields. Furthermore, this novel method could be applied to studying a variety of temperature distribution problems in which temperatures are measured with different scales.
