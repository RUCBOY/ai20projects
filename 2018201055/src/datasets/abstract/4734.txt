Although agriculture in the US is now firmly rooted in scientific investigation, farmers were dismissive of agricultural science for many decades. Currently, there is a well-established body of scientific evidence related to occupational hazards on farms, as well as strategies to mediate them. However, rates of injuries and illness remain higher in agriculture than almost any other industry. This paper, based on in-depth interviews with poultry producers in Texas, suggests that farmers are not receptive to health and safety research in agriculture. They do not trust researchersâ€™ agendas, they fear that there will be negative economic consequences, and they do not agree that the questions asked by safety and health researchers are scientifically valid. As a result, agricultural safety and health research resembles earlier iterations of agricultural science in which the industry is resistant to accept the validity of the research process, approach, or evidence presented.
