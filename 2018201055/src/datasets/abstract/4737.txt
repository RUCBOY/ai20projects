Experimental teaching is an important link of cultivating studentsâ€™ innovation ability and practice ability, and is also a good platform for applying the abstract theoretical knowledge to practice. However, the deficiency of teachers and experimental equipment has been the bottleneck for experimental teaching to further develop. In order to solve this problem, a kind of intelligent experimental teaching platform based on Internet technology is proposed in this paper; the structure and the basic composition of the system as well as the key technology for the software development are also discussed. Based on this teaching platform, students can do experiments at any time where they are as long as a computer internet can be available, and there is no restriction on time and site. It optimizes the experimental management and improves the effect of the experimental teaching.
