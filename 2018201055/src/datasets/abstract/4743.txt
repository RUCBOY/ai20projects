Online data collection is increasingly utilized in the field of psychology. While there is a growing literature regarding the advantages of computer-based data collection, little is known regarding the psychometric comparability of measures across computer-based and traditional paper-and-pencil administration methods. This is especially true with regard to caregiver-report ratings of children’s behavioral, academic, and emotional functioning. In this between-subjects study, the psychometric properties of caregiver behavioral, academic, and emotional functioning ratings for youth between the ages of 5 and 18 representing a mixed clinical sample were compared across computer-based (online group; n = 3831) and paper-and-pencil (P&P group; n = 514) administration formats. Groups differed on sex, age, and rater education distributions. Controlling for these variables, no statistically significant differences between groups were found in terms of symptomatology. In terms of psychometric characteristics, no group differences were found on inter-item reliability for any measure, and inter-item reliability for all scales across groups fell within the acceptable range. Similarly, comparisons of factor loadings across groups indicate marked consistency in the psychometric structure of all measures across administration formats. These results suggest that, regardless of administration method, the psychometric properties of caregiver ratings of childrens’ behavioral, academic, and emotional functioning remain consistent.
