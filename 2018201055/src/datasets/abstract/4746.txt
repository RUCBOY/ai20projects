In this paper, we present the feasibility of the Automatic Guided Vehicle (AGV) application as a platform for gait monitoring in non-laboratory environments. Proposed technique could be used by participants with difficulties to wear on board sensors, or devices. First of all, we present the study of the basic problems in the field of computer vision for medical applications: the gait parameters measurements of the spatial point, and sponsored a novel way of two-dimension parameters data acquisition from a single image captured by a monocular camera. A novel Foot Flat Phase (FFP) detection method is investigated that could effectively overcome the influence of viewpoints on static gait motion capture devices. Experimental results validate new view-invariant gait analysing method, and show that the extracted gait feature is reliable in non-clinic environment.
