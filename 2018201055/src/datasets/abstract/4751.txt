North China University Of Science and Technology is not only as a role of education, research and community service task, and an important community constituting society, but also a large customer of resource and energy. this paper proposes systematically how to launch subjects of actual measurement and simulation of energy consumption and the analysis of energy-saving for the energy consumption of campus. On the basis of analysis of the college typical building energy consumption, this paper tests the illumination, noise and formaldehyde concentration of Yifu Library, gives a detailed analysis of the measurement data, and provides the basis for energy saving transformation, operation management and updating equipment.By using a building energy consumption simulation software-eQUEST to simulate and research the energy consumption of Yifu Library, and collecting and collating the 2012-2013 annual water, electricity and gas usage to analyze the above energy data, and obtain the current status and characteristics of campus energy consumption.Finally, by comparing the measured and simulated results, it shows that universities present tremendous potential for energy savings. Therefore, from energy conservation of the technology, management and behavior, the reasonable energy-saving reconstruction measures are put forward.
