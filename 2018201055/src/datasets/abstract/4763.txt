The need in new approach to developing applied fuzzy logics to bridge the gap between fuzzy logics in narrow and broad sense is suggested. It is based on combining concepts and tools of universal logic with the ideas of natural pragmatics, context-sensitive truth values and non-standard bipolar scales. The concept of meta-pragmatics for many-valued and fuzzy logics is introduced, its importance is shown on examples of bipolarities and neutralities. A methodology of computer-assisted fuzzy logic synthesizing on the basis of extended logical matrices is sketched.
