Industrial robots are usually used for pick-and-place applications, which require only point-to-point motion control. However, the recent developments, both in robot technology and in Computer Automated Machining (CAM) software, allow the use of these equipment in applications which require continuous path control, such as multi-axis milling processes. However, the producers do not offer robots specifically developed for this kind of application, thus the user has to choose the most appropriate robot for this goal from a wide range of general purpose robot types. This research work proposes a method based upon Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) for selecting the industrial robot for milling applications. Several attributes of the robots are proposed as selection criteria, and a simulation study of the milling capabilities of the robotic structure is also taken into consideration.
