This contribution aims at reporting, from the subjective point of view of a witness based in Orsay, the fundamental role of Ondrej Krivanek in the spectacular emergence of EELS (Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy) as a key tool in analytical electron microscopy. In this regard, he has successively designed and built while he was at Gatan, serial EELS spectrometers, parallel EELS spectrometers and post-column energy filters which have been fitted to many different (S)TEM columns installed around the world. More recently the implementation of monochromators on the NION dedicated STEM together with the realization and performance of aberration correctors (which lie out of the scope of the present review), have placed the most advanced instrumental tool in the hands of continuously increasing populations of users in many domains of materials science and in life sciences. Furthermore, the impact of Ondrej Krivanek has spread widely beyond his technical achievements into that of a highly respected organizer of workshops, bringing together at regular intervals, all the experts from around the world and building up a real community of scientists.
