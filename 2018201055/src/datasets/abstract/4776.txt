The existing electric power grid is upgraded into a smart grid through an intelligent communication infrastructures, layers of information, extensive computing and sensing technologies. These cyber and physical components of grid together constitute a complex cyber-physical system (CPS), and this integration increases the risk from cyber attacks and introduces new vulnerabilities to the power system. Researchers need a power system testbed which can provide a platform for realistic experiments. This paper presents the development of a real-time cyber-physical system testbed for cyber security and stability control. We use SEL 351S protection system with OPAL-RT including control functions and communications to build a cyber-physical environment. In this testbed, we conducted power grid security experiment by knocking down two transmission lines in a row and analyzed the impact of failures. Meanwhile, we provided two mitigation strategies for this failure using optimal power flow. In addition, we conducted load fluctuations for multimachine power system, and provide timely adaptive control strategies.
