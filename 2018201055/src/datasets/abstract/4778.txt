This paper is the part of research aimed at creating robotic manipulator controlled by means of Brain-Computer Interface for improving household self-reliance of persons with disabilities and expanding the scope of their activity. The robotic manipulator gives possibility of self-fulfillment in basic household functions, s.a. drinking, eating, facial hygiene. The paper presents a mathematical model of the kinematics of the robotic manipulator. The solution of the forward and inverse kinematics problems based on the geometric method are given and obtained in MATLAB for the 5DOF manipulator.
