The computer simulation of fire spread based on modelling of complex processes related to fire by Computer Fluid Dynamics CFD theory should be a significant contribution to increase of safety of road tunnels. This paper is about instant project aimed at creating simulation models of formation and spread of fires in the road tunnel. The simulations will be compared with real in-situ measurements of fire scenarios suggested by customer organization in two road tunnels. Within the project, Tunnel Traffic and Operation Simulator, as unique facility at University of Å½ilina will be extended by visualizations of smoke stratification in the virtual tunnel tube.
