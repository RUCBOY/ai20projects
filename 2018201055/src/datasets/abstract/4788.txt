Point alignment is an important topic in computer vision. In order to implement cross-stitch embroidery in an automatic way, the grid points in a raster like pattern are desired to be recognized at first. In this paper, we design an algorithm to align the grid points in a raster like pattern in case of checkerboard pattern, and the proposed method was used to recognize the weave holes in a cross-stitch pattern. The method implemented in four steps. First, vertices on the boundary were extracted via removing the inner points. Next, the four corner points were detected in the extracted boundary points. Then the left-lower and left-upper points were positioned. Finally, the points alignment was implemented starting at the left-lower point from the bottom to top, left to right. The comparison experiments demonstrated that our method is robust to geometrical distortion and pose change. The method was applied to align the weave holes in a cross-stitch pattern. The results showed that the proposed method addressed its potential application to the machine weave of the cross-stitch.
