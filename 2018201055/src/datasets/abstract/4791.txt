Bone densitometry (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry-DXA) is a vital medical tool needed for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in non-fractured patients; predicting future fracture risk; and monitoring bone mineral density (BMD) in untreated or treated patients. The history of the pivotal international society involved in the science and clinical interpretation of DXA, the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) is defined in this manuscript. Since DXA and Osteoporosis management are intimately linked, the ISCD has over the years developed strong bonds with both the National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) and the International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF). The positive impact that ISCD has led in the proper performance and clinical interpretation of bone mass measurements has been enormous worldwide.
