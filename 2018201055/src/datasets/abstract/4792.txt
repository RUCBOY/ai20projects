A summary of representative literature on multi-view recommender approaches is provided, describing their main characteristics, such as: their potential to overcome most common shortcomings in conventional recommender systems, as well as the use of data science, learning techniques and aggregation processes to combine information stemming from multiple views. A tabular summary is provided to facilitate the comparison of the similarities and differences among the surveyed works, along with commonly identified directions for future research in the topic.
