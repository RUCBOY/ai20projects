Image retrieval is an attractive topic in the field of information retrieval in electronic library and computer vision. This paper proposed a research in the field of Uyghur document image retrieval that using 128-dimensional SIFT features for Uyghur printed document images. Through the Euclidean distance ratio with different threshold to statistics the number of right and wrong matched points of SIFT feature key points to achieve the local feature based document image retrieval for 1000 Uyghur printed document images. Through experiment acquired around 995 right matched points of each Uyghur printed document image, where the total key points are 1418 and the 100% matching percentage, respectively. The experimental results indicate that the 128-dimension SIFT based image retrieval method is a kind of effective method for Uyghur document image.
