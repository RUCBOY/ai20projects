The stability and Hopf bifurcation have important effect on the design of neural networks. By revealing the effect of parameters on the stability and Hopf bifurcation of neural networks, we can better apply neural networks to serve humanity. This article is principally concerned with the stability and the emergence of Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order BAM neural networks with multiple delays. Applying Laplace transform, stability theory and Hopf bifurcation knowledge of fractional-order differential systems, we establish a new sufficient condition to ensure the stability and the emergence of Hopf bifurcation of the addressed fractional-order BAM neural networks with multiple delays. The research indicates that the delay has a vital effect on the stability and the appearance of Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order BAM neural networks. Computer simulations are put into effect to test the effectiveness of the theoretical findings. It is shown that when the sum of time delays crosses some critical values, the stability of networks loses and Hopf bifurcation will happen.
