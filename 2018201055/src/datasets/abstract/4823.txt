With the introduction of precision additive manufacturing techniques, the complexity of a particular fabricated part rivals that which is possible with conventional manufacturing alternatives. The drawback to this, however, is the time investment required to bring an object to its completion, which limits the practicality of an otherwise advantageous shift in manufacturing. To counteract this, an ambidextrous multipurpose hybrid machine (DEXTER), operating dual SCARA has been developed to reduce the time of single and multi-material builds. While the SCARA functionality brings forth new obstacles not inherent in conventional gantry setups, optimization studies were performed to minimize the irregularities in print performance. Ensuring a natural lateral movement in manufacturing practices between the traditional and dual arm approach. During prototyping, the current DEXTER model is being used to train the next generation in additive thinking, and to educate them on current manufacturing methods and devices. Doing so creates a generation with the skill set to join the workforce ready to take on the new revolution in manufacturing.
