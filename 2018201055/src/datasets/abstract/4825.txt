The popularity and advantages of cloud-based solutions is currently in the steep trend. Due to its several characteristics, it leads to the paradigm shift in the field of client-server computing technology. Virtual desktop infrastructure service is also moving toward cloud-based technologies. It is important to improve services to retain the attraction from users. Besides network impairment factors, the factors regarding user context should also be included to consider the Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end-users. This paper presents the experiment to prove whether the screen size has an impact on QoE of using cloud-based virtual desktop. The experiment is conducted with 20 participants who have experience in using remote desktop through personal computer. The experiment is design to let participants using virtual desktop remotely through devices with different screen sizes and evaluating their experience. The result shows that screen size has an effect toward the QoE of remote cloud-based virtual desktop. In other words, screen size is one of the important factors in user context that influences QoE
