CFD (Computational Fluids Dynamic) is an important branch of fluid dynamics. It applies various kinds of discrete mathematical method to analyze and simulate problems in fluid mechanics with the use of computer. During the computation, huge computational tasks on a single CPU often makes it very inefficient to get the result, so there is an increasing number of application of parallel computation in CFD. With more powerful computing capability and lower price, GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) has become a better solution for parallel computing than CPU in some cases in recent years. In this paper, we implemented the HSMAC and SIMPLE algorithms on GPU. For the simulation of 2D lid-driven cavity flow, the GPU version could get a speedup up to 58x and 21x respectively with double precision, and 78x and 32x with single precision, compared to the sequential CPU version. It demonstrates a good prospects of GPU acceleration of CFD algorithms.
