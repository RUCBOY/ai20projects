Video based face recognition has attracted much attention and made great progress in the past decade. It has a wide range of applications in video conference, human-computer interaction, judicature identification, video surveillance, and entrance controlling, etc. Inspired by the image-set based object classification methods, we present a multi-scale image-set based on collaborative representation method which is optimized by margin distribution for face recognition in videos. We use the collaborative representation method to get the outputs of different sizes of sub image sets, and obtain the final result by optimally combining these outputs. Experimental results on public video face databases demonstrate that our proposed method can be able to outperform a number of existing state-of-the-art ones.
