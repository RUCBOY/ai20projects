Unmarked tracking of hands and fingers is a promising enabler for humanâ€“computer interaction. It can also be applied to medical monitoring and handicap aids. This will give much help to the deaf-mutes who have trouble in communicating with others or interact with the computers. In this paper, we present a 3D hand tracking and character recognition algorithm using binocular stereo camera, which can get the crucial depth information of the target. To precisely understand the characters that the user writes in the air, we define a valid gesture indicating that the user is inputting useful information and a null gesture indicating that corresponding movements are not necessary in the characters. Our approach can adapt to angle variation and make the writing freer. We show the benefits of our method by evaluating on several videos.
