Accurate modeling and recognition of the brain activity patterns for reliable communication and interaction are still a challenging task for the motor imagery (MI) brain-computer interface (BCI) system. In this paper, we propose a common spatial pattern (CSP) and chaotic particle swarm optimization (CPSO) twin support vector machine (TWSVM) scheme for classification of MI electroencephalography (EEG). The self-adaptive artifact removal and CSP were used to obtain the most distinguishable features. To improve the recognition results, CPSO was employed to tune the hyper-parameters of the TWSVM classifier. The usefulness of the proposed method was evaluated using the BCI competition IV-IIa dataset. The experimental results showed that the mean recognition accuracy of our proposed method was increased by 5.35%, 4.33%, 0.78%, 1.45%, and 9.26% compared with the CPSO support vector machine (SVM), particle swarm optimization (PSO) TWSVM, linear discriminant analysis LDA), back propagation (BP) and probabilistic neural network (PNN), respectively. Furthermore, it achieved a faster or comparable central processing unit (CPU) running time over the traditional SVM methods.
