Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is a comprehensive transportation management system based on advanced information, communication, sensing, control and computer technology. Stemming from and first applied to road transportation, this system has played an important role in strengthening the road traffic capacity and service, improving environment quality and enhancing energy efficiency. It has also spread to such transportation means as aviation, water transport and railway. International cargo transportation usually involves a number of different transportation means, which gives rise to the need for comprehensive monitoring, management and optimization of multimodal transport, but study on that area isnâ€™t common yet. Concerning road, waterway, aviation and railway involved in multimodal transportation, this paper proposes the Multimodal Monitoring technology that is able to manage multiple vehicles holistically to realise full-time monitoring, dispatching and optimization. The paper also puts forth the models of technical system, service functions and network layers of Multimodal Monitoring, and provides the technical solution to establish the Generic Target Monitoring System (GTMS).
