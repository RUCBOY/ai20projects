With the advance of Massively Parallel Computers usage, the interconnect technology overcomes the limitations of communication as a new concept. One of the most significant challenges in this concept is suitable architecture for these networksâ€™ applications. Recently, x-Folded TM architecture was introduced as a desirable design in interconnection networks. The attractive features for x-Folded TM are less number of links and nodes compared with other architectures. This paper proposes a new mathematical model of x-Folded TM architecture to predict the average network delay under the transpose traffic pattern. Besides the mathematical model derivation for x-Folded TM architecture, we discuss the simulation experiment in x-Folded TM using the same assumptions for the purpose of validation. The mathematical results indicate that the average network delay for x-Folded TM architecture is reduced when compared with other topologies under transpose traffic pattern. The implementation of x-Folded TM architecture relies on simulations to evaluate the performance impact of the architecture as well. Consequently, all results yield the superiority of the x-Folded TM performance compared to the other networks.
