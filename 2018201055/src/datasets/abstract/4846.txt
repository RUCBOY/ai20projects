To identify the prevalence and relationship between the practice of sports and smoking in university students enrolled on accredited qualifications related to health and/or education sciences.
Cross-sectional study including 540 students (average age of 21.3 ± 3.8 years; 68% women) of the University of Vigo registered in degree programmes linked to health (Physical Therapy and Nursing), or education (Pre-School, Primary School and Physical Activity and Sport Sciences) who answered an “ad hoc” questionnaire relating sports practice and tobacco consumption.
Women showed a lower habit on sports practice and a higher tobacco consumption, regardless of their academic degree. The average share of students who recognised practicing sports was significantly minor in those enrolled in health careers (37.7% vs. 57.5%). Regarding tobacco consumption, the students enrolled in health careers reported the lowest prevalence (16.7%). Among the students associated to education, this prevalence was found to be 25.9%. The bivariate analysis showed a trend towards a lower sport practice among the smokers. This association was significant only among the moderate consumers.
The findings of this research show a low prevalence in sports practice among students enrolled in degrees associated to health, and a more relevant tobacco consumption among those enrolled in degrees associated to education. It seems necessary to develop strategies aimed at promoting healthy habits that should be taking into account the tobacco consumption reported by the student.
