According to the Stern Review (2007) there is a 50% risk of global temperatures rising by more than 5°C by the year 2100. As the Earth's systems are under increasing unsustainable pressures, human security is clearly at stake. Cities are regarded to be increasingly important sites for climate responses, and something can still be solved if humankind acts quickly. It is proposed that city adaptation and mitigation strategies should draw on collective intelligence and an innovative holism multi-systemic approach to the encompassing problem of climate change by breaking it up into smaller, manageable problems and crowdsourcing a way out by means of online argumentation systems, computer simulations, and collective decision making tools. As ‘first responders’, cities with similar location or vulnerability characteristics should also be encouraged to transfer best practices between each other. Furthermore, this theoretical exposition argues that whilst adaptation and mitigation strategies are crucial, at the very crux of it, humankind needs a fundamental change of metaphors: from seeing the world as a machine to understanding it as a holistic network.
