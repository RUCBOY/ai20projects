To ensure development in the tourism sector and to sustain competition, internship practices have become an essential element of education and are now compulsory. In this study, research has been conducted to assess how effective internship applications are for students, the extent to which students can benefit from internships will be analyzed and various recommendations will be proposed.
The findings reveal that various challenges and misunderstandings are encountered by students in internship practices that can place businesses and students in difficult situations. Students’ opinions regarding internship practices were obtained by applying a survey method, and the results were analyzed in a computer environment for this study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the opinions of the students who have completed their internships in the Tourism Management and Hotel Management Programs and to contribute to the related literature (Karacan, 2004).
The study was conducted with a sample of NEU Tourism and Hotel Management School students and a questionnaire technique was used. Previous studies were utilized whilst creating the survey questionnaire (Pelit&Güçer, 2006) (Sarı, 2007).
