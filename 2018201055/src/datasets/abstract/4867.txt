With the emergence and popularization of computers, human society has entered the media age. On the one hand, it is beneficial to balance the supervision of public opinion and the construction of judicial responsiveness mechanism; on the other hand, false news increases the pressure of the government, and is not conducive to the establishment and enhancement of the government’s public trust. Therefore, it is very important for the whole society to study the law of the spread of Internet public opinion and then to control it.In this paper, we study the propagation law of Internet public opinion with the object of “ Xiongan New Area ”. Since the media network public opinion has the similar process of exponential growth in the communication process, and will be influenced by external capacity constraints, we establish the Logistic equation, introduce the τ operator time delay differential equation, and finally establish the improved delay differential equation, which can describe the propagation trend of network news from the self media. It provides certain reference for the government to study the development of public opinion.
