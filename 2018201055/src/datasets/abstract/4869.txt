Technology questionnaires can assist in developing profiles that characterize the ability of people to use new technologies. Technology profiles may also be related to physical and cognitive abilities, and may possibly serve as proxies for constructs that may be more difficult to measure. The purpose of the research reported in this paper was to examine possible relationships between responses to questions about use of technologies and functional and frailty status as measured using a digital, tablet-based test battery. A battery of digitized cognitive and functional assessments was administered on a tablet, along with a technology questionnaire, to Canadian adults over 65 years who called 911 for paramedic services or who presented to an emergency department. 330 people between the ages of 65 and 97 years (mean = 75.8 years, standard deviation = 7.6) participated in the study. We observed significant relationships between elderly adultsâ€™ responses to questions about their technology use and their functional status and frailty scores with more technology use implying better functional status and less frailty. It is suggested that the present findings may lead to the use of more detailed technology profiles as efficient proxy estimates of overall functional ability and frailty status in elderly adults.
