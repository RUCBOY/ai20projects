This study examined the impact of tablet-based cross-curricular maths activities on the acquisition of higher-order learning outcomes over seven months in twelve third grade classrooms in Slovenia. In the experimental group (N = 124), classroom practice included tablet-based cross-curricular maths activities with post-participation testing to identify the effect on learning outcomes, and observations were conducted to identify the affordance and ergonomic characteristics of tablets for student learning. In the control group (N = 135) maths was taught as a discrete subject with traditional paper and pencil technology using manipulation of concrete objects. Groups were matched with respect to gender, ownership of a tablet computer and previous knowledge and understanding of maths. The instructional design of process-outcome strategies incorporated Bruner's (1966) three stage process with learning outcomes in the cognitive, affective-social and psychomotor domains. The affordance of tablet-based cross-curricular apps was examined with respect to domains of learning and ergonomics. The findings indicate that the tablet supported group had better outcomes, with a small effect size for conceptual knowledge (r = 0.10) and medium effect size for procedural knowledge (r = 0.33) and problem-solving abilities (r = 0.30). The authors therefore argue for the introduction of tablets in schools because their multi-sensory human-computer touch interaction provides interactive manipulatives supporting transition between representations on the concrete, visual and abstract level. The authors concluded that in cross-curricular maths teaching, tablets offers efficient use of resources from different subjects and multiple representations which facilitate learning outcomes in the cognitive, affective-social and psychomotor learning domains.
