In this paper, we proposed modeling and analysis method of service process of restaurant hall. We proposed method to analyze relationship among seat layout, the number of waitpersons and customers queuing in crowded restaurant. Queuing theory is often adapted to above analysis. Queuing theory is effective analysis technique when a customer has a static relation with the waitperson. It is difficult to analyze service process in which waitperson and customer act mutually and move at a service place. Therefore in this research we modeled behavior of customers and waitpersons using two-dimensional cellular automata (henceforth: CA). The modeling result for above mentioned process was implemented on a computer using multi agent simulation (henceforth: MAS). Relationship among the seat layout, the number of waitpersons and customers queuing in crowded restaurant was analyzed with computer simulation. This analytical technique was applied to a restaurant crowded in lunch time and the policy to decrease customer queuing time was discussed. As a result, it was founded that the seat layout that the number of customer in group and the number of customers who can sit in the seat is equal has effect to decrease customer queuing time and the effectiveness of this modeling and analysis method was confirmed.
