To describe patient experiences and perspectives of a group-based heart failure (HF) telerehabilitation program delivered to the homes via online video-conferencing.
Limited information currently exists on patient experiences of telerehabilitation for HF. Patient feedback and end-user perspectives provide important information regarding the acceptability of this new delivery model which may have a substantial impact on future uptake.
We used mixed-methods design with purposive sampling of patients with HF. We used self-report surveys and semi-structured interviews to measure patient experiences and perspectives following a 12-week telerehabilitation program. The telerehabilitation program encompassed group-based exercise and education, and were delivered in real-time via videoconferencing. Interviews were transcribed and coded, with thematic analysis undertaken.
Seventeen participants with HF (mean age [SD] of 69 [12] years and 88% males) were recruited. Participants reported high visual clarity and ease of use for the monitoring equipment. Major themes included motivating and inhibiting influences related to telerehabilitation and improvement suggestions. Participants liked the health benefits, access to care and social support. Participants highlighted a need for improved audio clarity and connectivity as well computer training for those with limited computer experience. The majority of participants preferred a combined face-to-face and online delivery model.
Participants in this study reported high visual clarity and ease-of-use, but provided suggestions for further improvements in group-based video telerehabilitation for HF.
