The Hartree-Fock method, one of the first applications of the new quantum mechanics in the frame of the many-body problem, had been elaborated by Rayner Douglas Hartree in 1928 and Vladimir Fock in 1930. Promptly, the challenge of tedious computations was being discussed and it is well known that the application of the method benefited greatly from the development of computers from the mid-to-late 1950s. However, the years from 1930 to 1950 were by no means years of stagnation, as the method was the object of several considerations related to its mathematical formulation, possible extension, and conceptual understanding. Thus, with a focus on the respective attitudes of Hartree and Fock, in particular with respect to the concept of quantum exchange, the present work puts forward some mathematical and conceptual clarifications, which played an important role for a better understanding of the many-body problem in quantum mechanics.
