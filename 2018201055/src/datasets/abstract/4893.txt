Complex decision-making problems require the use of multiple-criteria decision-making methods. The problems are faced by enterprises nowadays. There is a necessity to make decisions, not only in an accurate but also in a fast and efficient way. This is caused by a high competition level. The articleâ€™s authors decided to compare the efficiency (defined as a sum of operativeness and effectiveness in action) of two multiple-criteria decision-making methods: the Weighted Sum Model (WSM) and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). In the research the authors used a method of computer modelling and simulation to reflect how these decision-making methods perform quotient or differential transformations of parameter values by means of both the WSM and AHP method. Throughstatistical analysis it was proven that the results of both multiple-criteria decision-making methods are statistically similar regardless of the parameter transformation method adopted. As a consequence, the WSM method is characterised by its greater efficiency than AHP.
