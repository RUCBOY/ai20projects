One challenge in learning programming either by self-learning or in the classroom is the lack of interactive learning content. For teachers, authoring tool is a solution that can help them in designing materials with interactive video. For students, interactive learning materials will certainly increase interest and understanding of the material. Goal of this research is to build an authoring tool for producing interactive video to be run on the browser. The methodology used was the RUP (Rational Unified Process) which consists of Inception, Elaboration, Construction, and Transition phases. Result of this study is an authoring tool application for designing and producing interactive video and generating it to HTML5 platform. Conclusions obtained are the authoring tool can help teachers to design teaching materials in the form of interactive video, and use it in teaching and learning process to increase students understanding of material.
