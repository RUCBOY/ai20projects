Computer virtualization brought fast resource provisioning to data centers and the deployment of pay-per-use cost models. The system virtualization provided by containers like Docker has improved this flexibility of resource provisioning. Applications that require more restrictive agreement and ordering guarantees can also benefit from operating inside containers. This paper proposes the integration of coordination services in a container management system called Kubernetes (k8s), seeking to restrict the containersâ€™ size and to offer automatic state replication. A protocol that uses shared memory available in Kubernetes was developed, and an evaluation was conducted to show the viability of the proposal.
