STEP-NC is a new standard for Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tool programming. It contains many elaborated data models for milling and turning, including the representation of parameters and geometry of machining features. The paper presents the use of STEP-NC data model for CAPP system under the development. The structure of manufacturing process was analyzed and the method to represent it using STEP-NC entities was proposed. New entities were added to store the information required by CAPP system, including the manufacturing process other than machining. Express-G data modelling language was used for this purpose.
