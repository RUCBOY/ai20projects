We present a high performance computing framework for large scale simulation of compressible multicomponent flows, applied to cloud cavitation collapse. The governing equations are discretized by a Godunov-type finite volume method on a uniform structured grid. The bubble interface is captured by a diffuse interface method and treated as a mixing region of the liquid and gas phases. The framework is based on our Cubism library which enables the efficient treatment of high-order compact stencil schemes that can harness the capabilities of massively parallel computer architectures and allows for processing up to 1013 computational cells. We present validations of our approach on several classical benchmark examples and study the collapse of a cloud of O(103) bubbles.
