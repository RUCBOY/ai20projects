The brain emotional learning (BEL) control paradigm has been gathering increased interest by the control systems design community. However, the lack of a consistent mathematical formulation and computer based tools are factors that have prevented its more widespread use. In this article both features are tackled by providing a coherent mathematical framework for both the continuous and discrete-time formulations and by presenting a SimulinkÂ® computational tool that can be easily used for fast prototyping BEL based control systems.
