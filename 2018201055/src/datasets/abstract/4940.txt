The schemotechnical solutions of object controllers (OCs) cannot be generally accessible due to their technological value. At the same time, OCs are an integral part of computer-based interlocking systems (CBIS), and study of their operation is required to determine the prospects of development and training of the service staff of CBIS.
To replenish the insufficient information, the analysis has been carried out per the description of CBIS EBILOCK 950 and the circuit-based technical solution for high-power outputs of MOT OC for three-phase e-motors of alternating current is offered.
The proposed schemotechnical solution comprises also a set of diagnostic tools (DT). This set enables to follow the technical condition of power elements of MOT OC, as well as the technical condition of the object of control and diagnosing (OCD), which increases the penetration depth of DT.
Application of the expanded set of DT in high-power outputs of MOT OC, allows to ensure more efficient maintenance process of point machine. The maintenance efficiency is achieved through use of technical diagnosis of OCD and determines the maintenance frequency, ensuring the timeliness of preventive work.
