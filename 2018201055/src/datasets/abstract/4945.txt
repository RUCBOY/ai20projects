The new HLRS flagship system Hazel Hen (a Cray XC40) is Europe's fastest system in the High Performance Conjugate Gradients (HPCG) benchmarking list. Designed to provide maximum sustainable performance to the users of HLRS - ignoring both peak and Linpack performance numbers - it has even climbed to number 8 in the TOP500 list and is one of the fastest systems in the world used both by research and industry. This paper will present insight into the strategy that was at the heart of the HLRS decision. It will further show how Hazel Hen can and has already impacted research and industry by providing high sustained performance for real world applications. In this paper we will show two applications and discuss the industrial uptake of the system.
