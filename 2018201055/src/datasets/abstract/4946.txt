This paper aims to introduce an effective method of making allowance for the potential impact of other transmission system operators (TSOs) or market players on the operation mode of a specific TSO in estimations referring to the full grid model based on the amount of real-time data sufficient to simulate a limited the interconnected power system (IPS) zone, yet not enough to update the full grid model. The preparation procedure of simulation of the equipotential grid model (EG) within the IPS based on the up-to-date computer technology is disclosed. The results of the EG-based emergency disturbance simulation in reference to the power system state estimation (SE) in real-time are more reliable in comparison with the results of other models. The EG application is more efficient in the procedure of analyzing the IPS tolerability against a specific number of potential faults and outages of individual components empowered by the most relevant calculations due to well-known software support.
