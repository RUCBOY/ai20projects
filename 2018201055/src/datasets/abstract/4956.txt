Surface registration plays a significant role in computer vision and engineering fields. One of the most challenging problems in surface registration, however, is to obtain a unique bijective registration for surfaces with large deformations and landmarks constraints. In this work, a novel surface registration framework is proposed to tackle this problem using optimal mass transport mapping (OMT-Map) and Teichm√ºller mapping (T-Map). All metric surfaces with the disk topology are mapped to the planar disk using OMT-Map, which avoids huge area distortion, thus rendering our method more robust. A landmark-constrained T-Map is then computed between two planar disks such that the maximal conformality distortion is minimized while the landmarks are matched. Compared with existing surface registration methods, our method is more advantageous in enforcing the robustness by avoiding large area distortion, and producing diffeomorphisms with all landmarks matched consistently. Numerical experiments on various surfaces demonstrate the efficiency, robustness of our method.
