What is the level of technology engagement by people attending pulmonary rehabilitation? Are participant demographics and level of technology engagement associated with willingness to use telerehabilitation?
A cross-sectional, multicentre study involving quantitative survey analysis.
Convenience sample of people with chronic respiratory disease attending a pulmonary rehabilitation program, maintenance exercise class or support group.
The survey assessed the participants’ level of technology engagement (access to and use of devices), self-rated skill competence, access to online health information and willingness to use telerehabilitation.
Among the 254 people who were invited, all agreed to complete the survey (100% response rate). Among these 254 respondents, 41% were male, the mean age was 73 years (SD 10), and the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) was 59% predicted (SD 23). Ninety-two percent (n = 233) of participants accessed at least one technological device, of whom 85% (n = 198) reported regularly using mobile phones and 70% (n = 164) regularly used a computer or tablet. Fifty-seven percent (n = 144) of participants self-rated their technology skill competence as good and 60% (n = 153) of all participants were willing to use telerehabilitation. The multivariate regression model found regular computer use (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.72 to 5.71) and regular mobile phone use (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.32 to 6.09) were most associated with a willingness to use telerehabilitation.
People attending metropolitan pulmonary rehabilitation, maintenance exercise classes and support groups had substantial technology engagement, with high device access and use, and good self-rated technology competence. The majority of participants were willing to use telerehabilitation, especially if they were regular users of technology devices.
