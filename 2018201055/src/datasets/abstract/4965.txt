The aim of the study was to examine selected factors of health-related behaviour in children and youth in the Pardubice and Hradec Králové regions (which constitute East Bohemia). The participants were 664 pupils and were students of selected elementary and secondary schools.
The research was carried out by means of quantitative data collection, using a questionnaire of our own design which included scale questions. The questionnaire of risk behaviour in adolescence investigates the risk factors of lifestyle in children and youth, i.e. specifically the category of truancy, neglecting school duties, addictive behaviour, aggressive behaviour including self-harm, reproductive health-related risk behaviour, and computer and internet use-related risk behaviour. The contribution presents results concerning the selected categories of risk behaviour, including their interrelations. The results demonstrate the significant relations among the individual examined phenomena in the research group. Low gender differences are also interesting. In terms of gender, there were differences only in aggressive behaviour and the time spent using a computer or the internet. Male pupils scored higher in both the mentioned variables. Respondents’ age was only related to truancy, which decreased as their age increased.
