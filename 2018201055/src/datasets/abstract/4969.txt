Radio frequency (RF) heating has been considered as an alternative method to traditional thermal treatments for postharvest pasteurization and disinfestations. However, the non-uniform heating in food samples is the main obstacle to be urgently solved. In this study, mica plates were placed on top of the samples with polypropylene blocks placed in between the samples as a new strategy to improve the RF heating uniformity. A computer simulation model was developed based on the commercial software COMSOL to evaluate the temperature distributions. Experiments with peanut samples placed in three dimensions of containers were conducted to validate the simulation model. The results showed that adding mica plates with the similar dimension to the cold spot of samples and increasing the plate thickness effectively improved the RF heating uniformity. Adding polypropylene blocks raised sample average temperatures and finally optimized the RF heating uniformity.
