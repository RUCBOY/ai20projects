The problems of optimization of parameters and modes of processing for drilling deep holes by twist drills were studied. Drilling was carried out under the control of a special control system that measures the torque on the tool. The drilling process and the beginning of the definition of packaging chips were monitored. The control algorithm was based on the limitation of the maximum torque resistance, acting on the tool. The torque limit has been set on the basis of the torsional strength of the tool. The analytical calculation and computer simulation processing time drilling deep holes were made on the basis of experimental studies. It is shown that there is extremal dependence of the time of drilling from the vertical feed rate depending on predetermined limits on the maximum torque
