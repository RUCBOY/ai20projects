Sign Language Recognition is a breakthrough for helping deaf-mute people and has been researched for many years. Unfortunately, every research has its own limitations and are still unable to be used commercially. Some of the researches have known to be successful for recognizing sign language, but require an expensive cost to be commercialized. Nowadays, researchers have gotten more attention for developing Sign Language Recognition that can be used commercially. Researchers do their researches in various ways. It starts from the data acquisition methods. The data acquisition method varies because of the cost needed for a good device, but cheap method is needed for the Sign Language Recognition System to be commercialized. The methods used in developing Sign Language Recognition are also varied between researchers. Each method has its own strength compare to other methods and researchers are still using different methods in developing their own Sign Language Recognition. Each method also has its own limitations compared to other methods. The aim of this paper is to review the sign language recognition approaches and find the best method that has been used by researchers. Hence other researchers can get more information about the methods used and could develop better Sign Language Application Systems in the future.
