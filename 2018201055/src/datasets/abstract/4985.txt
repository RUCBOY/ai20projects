Today, many common activities have been transformed to electronic and online based environments because of the increased usage of technology and the Internet. Education is one of the sectors that is using computer technologies for training and delivering learning information to learners. Learning management systems (LMS) applications are some of the frequently used applications. There are different LMSs with different feature specifications available on the Internet, which can be accessed at anytime, anywhere and by anyone who wants to use them. Making an appropriate evaluation of the LMS and identifying the most important features should be considered before the evaluation of the LMS can be a complex process because the increasing number of features that are now available. The Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method is now widely used by researchers to solve various problems that involve different criteria. This study suggests a fuzzy DEMATEL model to determine the interrelations between LMS evaluation criteria, their effects on each other as well as which criteria are the most important. Twelve criteria selected as the most important by experts will be considered in the study. Ten LMS experts made decisions based on the pairwise comparison of the criteria to be used in the DEMATEL method. Based on the case study, the result demonstrates that the three most important criteria are user satisfaction, learnability and usability among the 12 criteria considered. The research proposes a combination of this method and other MCDM techniques in the future to evaluate and select an alternative based on selected criteria, the research also suggested developing an application to substitute the manual evolution process.
