Cyber Security has become rising issue in recent years where encryption is one of solution and has an important role in data protection. Encryption algorithms that widely used in information security are asymmetric and symmetric. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is one of symmetric encryption that most used often and the most secure encryption today. However, AES encryption has slow computation. Our experiment show that both of algorithms combination needs 3.045 milliseconds for 1024 bytes of data and increase 3-4 milliseconds for 2048 bytes of data and so on. This paper proposes a novelty method to improve AES algorithm with Shift Row and S.Box modification for Mix Column transformation. The result show that our optimization has reduced 3 milliseconds and continue to increase as the number of bytes increases. Percentage average of the optimization is 86.143%.
