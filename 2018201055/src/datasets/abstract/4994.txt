Nowadays technology is in every aspect of our lives. The exponential growth of new information technologies during recent years has increased society's enthusiasm and visionary expectations (technophilia), as well as fears and discomfort (technophobia). However, technophobia and technophilia are two concepts that are hardly studied, with very few specific measurements developed so far. The present paper aims to develop and validate the Technophobia and Technophilia Questionnaire (TTQ) in a sample composed of 534 participants from two different countries (Poland and Estonia). Practical implications, study limitations and directions for future research are discussed.
