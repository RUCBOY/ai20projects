An image multiplexing and authentication method based on the double-phase retrieval algorithm (DPRA) with the manipulations of wavelength and position in the Fresnel transform (FrT) domain is proposed in this study. The DPRA generates two matched phase-only functions (POFs) in the different planes so that the corresponding image can be reconstructed at the output plane. Given a number of target images, all the sets of matched POFs are used to generate the phase-locked system through the phase modulation and synthesis to achieve the multiplexing purpose. To reconstruct a target image, the corresponding phase key and all the correct parameters in the FrT are required. Therefore, the authentication system with high-level security can be achieved. The computer simulation verifies the validity of the proposed method and also shows good resistance to the crosstalk among the reconstructed images.
