A physics-based drain current compact model for amorphous InGaZnO (a-InGaZnO) thin-film transistors (TFTs) is proposed. As a key feature, the surface potential model accounts for both exponential tail and deep trap densities of states, which are essential to describe a-InGaZnO TFT electrical characteristics. The surface potential is solved explicitly without the process of amendment and suitable for circuit simulations. Furthermore, based on the surface potential, an explicit closed-form expression of the drain current is developed. For the cases of the different operational voltages, surface potential and drain current are verified by numerical results and experimental data, respectively. As a result, our model can predict DC characteristics of a-InGaZnO TFTs.
