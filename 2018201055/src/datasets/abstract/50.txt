Detailed information about various gamma-ray shielding parameters (GSP) is required to investigate the building's gamma-ray shielding efficacy. The computer plays an essential role in such investigations by calculating the GSP. The multi-layered shields provide better shielding efficacy than the single-layered protectors. This work aims to describe the development of an online-platform to calculate 36 GSP for both types of shields. A computer code for the platform has been written in Python and named as Py-MLBUF. It calculates the GSP, in the energy range 0.015–15 MeV. One can use the developed platform free of cost from https://pymlbuf.pythonanywhere.com. It is accessible from computers and smartphones. The added features like fast calculation speed, higher accuracy, graph plotting capability, analyzing and suggesting an improvement in shielding efficacy, and sending the results via e-mail, make it unique. Py-MLBUF will serve as a free interactive educational tool to provide free research consultancy in improving radiological safety.
