Script identification is an essential step in the text extraction pipeline for multi-lingual application. This paper presents an effective approach to identify scripts in scene text images. Due to the complicated background, various text styles, character similarity of different languages, script identification has not been solved yet. Under the general classification framework of script identification, we investigate two important components: feature extraction and classification layer. In the feature extraction, we utilize a hierarchical feature fusion block to extract the multi-scale features. Furthermore, we adopt an attention mechanism to obtain the local discriminative parts of feature maps. In the classification layer, we utilize a fully convolutional classifier to generate channel-level classifications which are then processed by a global pooling layer to improve classification efficiency. We evaluated the proposed approach on benchmark datasets of RRC-MLT2017, SIW-13, CVSI-2015 and MLe2e, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of each elaborate designed component. Finally, we achieve better performances than those competitive models, where the correct rates are 89.66%, 96.11%, 98.78% and 97.20% on PRC-MLT2017, SIW-13, CVSI-2015 and MLe2e, respectively.
