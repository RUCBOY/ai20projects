Trust is a major concern that develops citizens' willingness to use social media as a technology platform for e-government services. However, despite its importance, there is lack of prior investigation about the factors that can generate citizens' trust to use such services, particularly in a developing country like Pakistan. To address this research gap, this study aims to develop a model that identifies antecedents of citizens' trust to use social media for e-government services. A total of 615 responses were collected from Pakistani citizens having familiarity with e-government and social media services. Partial least squares (PLS-SEM) method was employed to test the proposed relationships in the model. The findings show a significant relationship of trust with citizens intention to use government social media services. Information quality, structural assurances, perceived security, perceived privacy and perceived ease of use are identified as antecedents of trust. The proposed model of this study explains 56.4% of the variance in trust. The implications, limitations and suggestions for future research have also been discussed. These findings can assist government organizations and policy makers in making decisions to increase citizens participation by facilitating their trust on social media-based services of e-government.
