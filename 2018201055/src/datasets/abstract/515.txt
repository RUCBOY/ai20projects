In 1964 Erdős proved that (1+o1)eln(2)4k22k edges are sufficient to build a k-graph which is not two colorable. To this day, it is not known whether there exist such k-graphs with smaller number of edges. Erdős’ bound is consequence of the fact that a hypergraph with k2∕2 vertices and M(k)=(1+o1)eln(2)4k22k randomly chosen edges of size k is asymptotically almost surely not two colorable. Our first main result implies that for any ε>0, any k-graph with (1−ε)M(k) randomly and uniformly chosen edges is a.a.s. two colorable. The presented proof is an adaptation of the second moment method analogous to the developments of Achlioptas and Moore (2002) who considered the problem with fixed size of edges and number of vertices tending to infinity. In the second part of the paper we consider the problem of algorithmic coloring of random k-graphs. We show that quite simple, and somewhat greedy procedure, a.a.s. finds a proper two coloring for random k-graphs on k2∕2 vertices, with at most Oklnk⋅2k edges. That is of the same asymptotic order as the analogue of the algorithmic barrier defined by Achlioptas and Coja-Oghlan (2008), for the case of fixed k.
