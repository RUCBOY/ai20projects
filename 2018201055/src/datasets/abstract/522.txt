By applying Zhang neural dynamics method, this study proposed, analyzed, and investigated a continuous-time model for solving the time-varying Schur decomposition (SD) problem. The proposed model is an explicit dynamics model that utilizes the time derivative information. The theoretical analysis of the proposed model is presented to verify its convergence and efficiency in solving the time-varying SD problem. Furthermore, the proposed model is used to perform the SD of three time-varying matrices with different dimensions. Results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model.
