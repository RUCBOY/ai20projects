In the article, the authors present an advanced model of hyperbolic torsion spring based on the Finite Element Method (FEM). This model takes into account the contact forces between the spring arms, which allows you to simulate its operation even in the case of a large twisting angle. On the basis of this FEM model, the spring stiffness characteristics were constructed. Based on this characteristics, the existing 2S1 track platform model has been rebuilt. In this model, a much higher mass of the body is allowed than in the original model. On the basis of the elastic spring model, parameters such as the static deflection of the suspension have also been determined, as well as its range of mobility compared to the original suspension based on torsion bars. In addition, spring deflection phases have been presented in terms of internal stresses, which are important for the strength analysis of the spring. The originality of the described solution lies in the unique design of the so-called a hyperbolic spring. This design has not been previously described in the literature.
