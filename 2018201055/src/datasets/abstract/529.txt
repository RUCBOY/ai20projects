Laryngeal vestibule (LV) closure is a critical physiologic event during swallowing, since it is the first line of defense against food bolus entering the airway. Identifying the laryngeal vestibule status, including closure, reopening and closure duration, provides indispensable references for assessing the risk of dysphagia and neuromuscular function. However, commonly used radiographic examinations, known as videofluoroscopy swallowing studies, are highly constrained by their radiation exposure and cost. Here, we introduce a non-invasive sensor-based system, that acquires high-resolution cervical auscultation signals from the neck and accommodates advanced deep learning techniques for the detection of LV behaviors. The deep learning algorithm, which combined convolutional and recurrent neural networks, was developed with a dataset of 588 swallows from 120 patients with suspected dysphagia and further clinically tested on 45 samples from 16 healthy participants. For classifying the LV closure and opening statuses, our method achieved 78.94% and 74.89% accuracies for these two datasets, suggesting the feasibility of implementing sensor signals for LV prediction without traditional videofluoroscopy screening methods. The sensor supported system offers a broadly applicable computational approach for clinical diagnosis and biofeedback purposes in patients with swallowing disorders without the use of radiographic examination.
