How can we better understand the process of therapeutic art-making for stroke rehabilitation, and what are design opportunities for virtual reality art-making for people with stroke-related impairments? We investigated this question in a two-part study with 14 amateur artists with disabilities resulting from stroke: a three-week field study and a technology probe consisting of experiential virtual reality interviews. We uncovered what participants made, the aesthetics of the materials and the process of making. The field study revealed inspirations around identity, situatedness of choices for tools in the social and physical environment, and a breadth of application techniques (e.g., dripping paint or use of tape) that varied in need for fine motor control. The experiential virtual reality interviews highlighted the need for control, the affordances of the medium, and the challenges in viewing and reflecting on work. Emergent art reflected qualities of the 3D paint and free-form gesture. Virtual reality and traditional art-making contrasted in the speed and finality of application, opportunities for iteration and reflection, and in the need for dexterity. We discuss strengths, weaknesses and implications for design of virtual reality art-making for those with stroke-related impairments.
