Image encryption is one of the most effective means to ensure the security of image information in network communications. A new unified image encryption system with identical encryption and decryption algorithms was proposed in this paper. In this system, an external key and the Hénon map are used to generate the equivalent secret keys. Then, a kind of lifting-like transformation is employed to diffuse the image information to fulfill the image encryption. On the computer configured with i7-9750H CPU, the unified image cryptosystem realized by C# program has the encryption/decryption speed of 59 Mbps. Meanwhile the proposed cryptosystem possesses strong sensitivities of secret key, plain image and ciphered image for the maximum relative error of their test indexes is only 0.55%. Thus the proposed can be used as a candidate scheme of network image information security.
