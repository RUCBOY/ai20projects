Kernel ridge regression (KRR) is an efficient method for regression task. However, KRR has a deficiency in finding appropriate type of kernel functions and their parameters. To overcome this shortcoming, a novel kernel ensemble framework is developed. In this ensemble framework, each kernel regressor is associated with a weight that can be adaptively determined according to its contribution to the regression result. By this way, more appropriate kernels and more accurate parameters can be learned directly from data without any manual intervention, which results in better performance in regression. In addition, to overcome the influence of existing outliers, the regressor loss is modeled as a sparse signal, thus a Sparse Loss induced Kernel Ensemble Regression (SLiKER) method is obtained. Experimental results on several UCI regression and computer vision datasets show that our proposed approach obtains best regression and classification performances among the state-of-art comparative methods.
