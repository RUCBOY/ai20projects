This study aimed to strengthen trust in the cross-border beef supply chain between Australia and China from a consumer perspective based on a blockchain-based supply chain implementation. Using a design science approach, this studyâ€™s initial prototype was developed to strength consumer trust. The study was conducted in partnership with Australian agricultural producers and processors, and empirically tested with Chinese consumers using an exploratory, qualitative methodology comprising focus groups. Based on the empirical evidence from prototype testing and the insights from supply chain stakeholders, this paper explores new features for a human-machine reconcile mechanism that enables shared responsibilities between agriculture and supply chain actors in delivering credentialed traceability data to consumers along the Australia-China beef supply chain.
