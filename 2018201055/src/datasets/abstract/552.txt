Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) exerts a wide range of biological effects and attracts a lot of attention of researchers. Two sites are involved in manifestation of PLA2 enzymatic activity: catalytic site responsible for substrate binding and fatty acid cleavage from the sn-2 position of a glycerophospholipid, and interface binding site (IBS) responsible for the protein binding to lipid membrane. IBS is formed by positively charged and hydrophobic amino acids on the outer surface of the protein molecule. Understanding the mechanism of PLA2 interaction with the lipid membrane is the most challenging step in biochemistry of this enzyme. We used a combination of experimental and computer simulation techniques to clarify molecular details of bee venom PLA2 interaction with lipid bilayers formed by palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine. We found that after initial enzyme contact with the membrane, a network of hydrogen bonds was formed. This led to deformation of the interacting leaflet and dint formation. The bilayer response to the deformation depended on its phase state. In a gel-phase bilayer, diffusion of lipids is restricted therefore chain melting occurred in both leaflets of the bilayer. In the case of a fluid-phase bilayer, lateral diffusion is possible, and lipid polar head groups were excluded from the contact area. As a result, the bilayer became thinner and a large hydrophobic area was formed. We assume that relative ability of a bilayer to come through lipid redistribution process defines the rate of initial stages of the catalysis.
