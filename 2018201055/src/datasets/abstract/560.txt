Doping to graphene is essential for developing graphene-based electronic devices and circuits, while traditional doping methods to graphene are still challenging due to unstable doping characteristics and unavoidable damage to the graphene structure. Here, we demonstrate piezoionic-powered strain and touch sensors using mechanically doped graphene with solid polymer electrolyte (SPE). Due to the piezoionic effect in SPE, the Dirac point voltage of an SPE-coated graphene field-effect transistor (S-GFET) is shifted left/right upon compressive/tensile strain. This mechanical strain tuned piezoionic doping to graphene that enables to obtain different Dirac point voltage of S-GFET for a piezoionic-powered strain sensor. When the S-GFET acted as a strain sensor, the S-GFET exhibited stable output signals against to continuous strain and was able to distinguish between tension and compression without any additional components. The strain sensor mounted on a hand very effectively responded to the hand joint movement. Additionally, it was found that the device is also suitable for touch sensing due to the coupling of triboelectrification and the electronic transport in the S-GFET.
