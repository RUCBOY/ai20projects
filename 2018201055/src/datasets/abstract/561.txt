In this paper, we continue the study of non-covalent supramolecular systems based on zinc bis(dipyrromethenate)s ([Zn2L2]) with fullerene C60 and present the results of study of [Zn2L2]s periphery methylation degree effect on their supramolecular complexation with C60. The structural organization and spectral properties of supramolecular systems based on [Zn2L2]s and C60 were studied by means of UV/vis, fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, elemental analysis, FT-IR, PXRD, 1H NMR, DOSY spectroscopy, and computer modeling. The revealed features and the photoelectrochemical characteristics (photocurrent density, IPCE) obtained by the amperometric method give evidence of potential usage of [Zn2L2]s-C60 supramolecular complexes with 1:4 stoichiometry as optoelectronics and photovoltaic devices components.
