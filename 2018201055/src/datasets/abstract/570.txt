We present the first static and dynamic external memory data structures for variants of 2-d orthogonal range skyline reporting with worst-case logarithmic query and update I/O-complexity. The results are obtained by using persistent data structures and by extending the attrition priorities queues of Sundar (1989) [26] to also support real-time concatenation, a result of independent interest. We show that the problem is as hard as standard 2-d orthogonal range reporting in the indexability model by a lower bound on the I/O-complexity of 2-d orthogonal anti-dominance skyline reporting queries.
