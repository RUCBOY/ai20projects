In addition to well-known attention deficiencies, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is accompanied by deficiencies in social cognition. Both intentional and spontaneous interpersonal synchrony have been found to be an essential part of successful human interaction. Here, we used a novel paradigm to assess intentional and spontaneous interpersonal synchrony in adults with and without ADHD. Our data indicate that intentional interpersonal synchrony is reduced in ADHD, whereas spontaneous interpersonal synchrony remains intact. These results suggest that a dysfunctional pattern of interpersonal synchrony may account for interpersonal difficulties in ADHD.
