When can a polyomino piece of paper be folded into a unit cube? Prior work studied tree-like polyominoes, but polyominoes with holes remain an intriguing open problem. We present sufficient conditions for a polyomino with one or several holes to fold into a cube, and conditions under which cube folding is impossible. In particular, we show that all but five special “basic” holes guarantee foldability.
