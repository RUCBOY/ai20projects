In this talk we discuss several interesting aspects of collective flow in small systems in reference to planned future experiments. First, we bring in the novel possibility of exploring elliptic flow with heavy nuclei collisions on polarized deuteron targets, accessible in [email protected] program after Long Shutdown 3. Then we discuss the Glauber model predictions for the presently considered 16O −16O program at RHIC and the LHC. Finally, we turn to our previous proposal concerning specific flow signatures of intrinsic correlations (such as the predicted α clusterization) in the structure of light nuclei in collisions with heavy nuclei. In particular, 12C–heavy nucleus ultrarelativistic reactions would provide insight into the ground-state 12C structure, complementary to traditional nuclear structure measures.
