In this study a complete procedure is presented of how to generate finite element models based on X-ray computer tomography data on the fibre bundle scale for non-crimp fabric reinforced composites. Non-crimp fabric reinforced composites are nowadays extensively used in the load carrying parts of wind turbine blades. Finite element analysis based on X-ray computer tomographic data will allow faster and cheaper developments of key material parameters. However, automated procedures for computer tomography data transfer into finite elements models are lacking. In the current study, an X-ray computer tomography aided engineering (XAE) process including a fully automated segmentation method and an element-wise material orientation mapping of X-ray computer tomographic data is presented for the first time. The proposed methodology combines recent research progress and improvements in image analysis, and provides a fast, accurate and repeatable data transfer and analysis process with a high degree of automation.
