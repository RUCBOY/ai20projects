There is little empirical evidence on cross-domain relations with science and other academic domains, which contributes to a limited understanding of the development of early science and how to best support it. The purpose of this study was to examine multiple concurrent predictors of science core knowledge, including executive functioning (EF), vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language in preschool. This study overcomes the limitations of previous work exploring relations between individual predictors, by addressing potentially spurious relations due to acting as proxies for other variables. Data were collected from 86 preschool-aged children (36 female) from families with low incomes. Findings revealed that when EF, vocabulary, literacy, math, and math language were included in the same model as concurrent predictors of science, only vocabulary significantly predicted childrenâ€™s science core knowledge. Findings from this study have potential implications for the refinement of early science skills and intervention development.
