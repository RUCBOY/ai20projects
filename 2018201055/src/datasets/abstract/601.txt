In this paper, a novel approach based on non-inverse matrix online sequence extreme learning machine (NIOSELM) for phishing detection is presented, which takes into account three types of features to comprehensively characterize a website. For the NIOSELM algorithm, we use Sherman Morriso Woodbury equation to avoid the matrix inversion operation, and introduce the idea of online sequence extreme learning machine (OSELM) to update the training model. In order to reduce the dependence of the detection model on the majority class, we use Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) algorithm to generate the synthetic minority class samples to balance the distribution between the samples of the majority and minority classes. Furthermore, an improved denoising auto-encoder (SDAE) is designed to reduce the dimension of the experimental dataset. The experimental results show the efficiency and feasibility of the proposed detection mechanism. Moreover, the overall detection performance of NIOSELM is better than that of other existing methods, especially in training speed and the detection accuracy.
