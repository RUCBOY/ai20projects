In this paper, we propose a secret image sharing scheme with constant size shadow images. In the proposed scheme, the size of the shadow images is 23 Ã— 23 irrespective of the secret image size. The scheme also offers a lossless reconstruction of the secret image without requiring pre-sharing of a key between the share generator and combiner. The scheme is based on a multi-secret sharing scheme and uses pixel value co-ordinate sharing. We prove the security of the proposed secret image sharing scheme by reducing it to the underlying multi-secret sharing scheme. Finally, we evaluate the correctness of the scheme by conducting experiments on standard images.
