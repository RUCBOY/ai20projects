A novel asymmetric multiple-image encryption method based on quick response code and elliptic curve cryptography is proposed through our research. In this new scheme, four quick response code images converted from four images and a random generated intensity key are used as the input for the elliptic curve cryptography image encryption system, which can yield two real number ciphertexts. The ciphertext image is further decrypted through a digital decryption scheme. The proposed system uses both public and private keys thus it is an asymmetric encryption system. The method can encrypt up to sixteen images simultaneously. Comprehensive numerical simulations have demonstrated the robustness and effectiveness of the encryption scheme.
