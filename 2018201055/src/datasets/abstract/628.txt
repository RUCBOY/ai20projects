Recent legislation opening commercial operations to small drones, also known as Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) under 55 lbs, is leading to increased use across many facets of society including first responders, news agencies, commercial entities, and hobbyists. However, the widespread use of such systems will be limited unless a few key hurdles are overcome, namely improved usability and support for safe operation in dynamic environments. To this end, we present the Collision and Obstacle Detection and Alerting (CODA) display, a novel interface that enables safe piloting of MAVs with a mobile device in obstacle-dense real-world settings. We describe the system design, architecture, and development. In addition, we present observations from a proof-of-concept technical demonstration and an empirical study with minimally-trained users. Results showed that CODA reduced collisions and improved operator awareness of obstacle proximity, confidence going around corners and perceived performance in avoiding walls and obstacles.
