Built-in applications built on a stand-alone device, TCP / IP network and interconnected are a need for high integration with other systems. The system provided through Web services interconnects service-oriented distributed architecture. The TCP / IP network is widely employed to integrate business applications. This integration is still not provided through the embedded application. The applications connected to the Internet are an especially difficult problem in embedded systems to interpret the sensor data. Real-time sensor function generates a training/classification result for IoT application selected, customized, or data structure design. It has an integrated hardware/software system to achieve the continuous training and real-time data analysis and re-training of Machine Learning (ML) algorithm. World of English native speakers on top of all, this is the database of words that have been separated from the local and non-collection English. It also reported a variety of methods that are used in the English vocabulary recognition system. Please check the study of learners of mediation based on the part of the corpus. Students, in writing, too much-advanced technology and general vocabulary. These students, publicly their discourse in and contributed to the professional corpus of "existence" I mentioned that there is a professional writer, is better. To stimulate the different means of integration, it evaluated several network technology today, discussing the balance between the use of shared with this integration in the adaptability and built-in the field of Web network technology of today.
