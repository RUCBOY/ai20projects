In this paper, we construct a mathematical model for a supply chain with computer aided digital manufacturing process. We show that the model exhibits various complicated behaviors including chaotic attractors. A stabilizing linear feedback controller is designed to stabilize the supply chain system. We move on to develop an active controller to synchronize two such systems. The design methodologies are based on Lyapunov stability theory. By simulating the model numerically, we observe the chaotic behaviours of the model. We find that the system has chaotic behaviours over a wide range of the values of the system parameters. The numerical results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controllers. Our study reveals the interactions between the production and demand, in which the computer aided design plays an important role.
