The emergence of citizen science has opened new possibilities for research to inform management and conservation policies. This requires a deep understanding and inclusion of diverse stakeholders. In marine environments, divers are among the largest groups of citizen science volunteers, compared to other marine users. However, little is known about how the diversity of divers can affect their interest and participation in citizen science. Using 229 structured face-to-face interviews we investigated differences in diving specialization levels among diver types (i.e. artisanal fishers, dive instructors, recreational divers, divers with scientific background, and others) and we evaluated the relationship between diving specialization level and actual participation in Marine Citizen Science. Findings show important differences in diving specialization levels among diver types. Recreational divers have the lowest levels of specialization and artisanal fishers the highest. High levels of scientific training favored participation in the citizen science project, but there was no relationship between diving specialization level and participation rate. We conclude that different diver types have particular strengths and requirements to participate in Marine Citizen Science, and that integrating a diversity of divers can create important synergies. Taking the heterogeneity of potential participants into account will help engage a greater diversity of volunteers in citizen science and thus contribute to generating better policies and stakeholder support for marine conservation and sustainable management.
