Vibrational scale factors were determined for the M06-2X method. The calculated scale factors were supported statistically. The main objective is to determine the concordance between frequencies. Descriptive statistics of the experimental and corrected frequencies are given. The relationship between corrected and experimental frequencies is formed by a simple linear regression method. The Concordance Correlation Coefficient determines the consistency between the two variables. It evaluates the direct relationship between X and Y variables measured under constraints. Also, the difference between the mean of the two variables was tested. All results are interpreted and presented with their graphs.
