A simple and new method is proposed to realize the vortex beam emitter containing the tunable optical vortex array. We studied the optical vortex array by the method of control the dual copper wire for the diffraction within the high-order resonator, that is the copper wires are inserted into the open coaxial spherical resonator to modulate the diffraction of the laser, and then one of the copper wires are controlled to obtain a vortex beam emitter of tunable optical vortex array, which is achieved simply by tuning the distance between the copper wires and the optical axis. The optical vortex array generated by the laser is the result of mode that is selected after different loss of diffraction occur in the open coaxial spherical resonator and we change the loss of diffraction by the adjustment of the distance between the copper wires and the optical axis in the laser resonator to realize the adjustment of the optical vortex array. In addition, we also established a detected experiment of vortex and analyzed the detection of the vortex by the lateral shear interferometry. The regulation of the optical vortex array is proved by the analysis of the interference pattern of vortex.
