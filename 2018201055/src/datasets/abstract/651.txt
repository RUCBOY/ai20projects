Accurate prediction of the health level of a user is a useful and promising technique involving many domains, such as medical analysis, user behavior understanding, industrial design, and human–computer interaction (HCI). User health level can be collaboratively determined by the interactions of physical/cyber companions within the same medical circle, since humans are generally considered social animals. Based on this observation, we propose a novel model for user health level categorization based on the intelligent fusion of medical evaluation results derived from multiple medically-aware social networks. More specifically, given the massive scale of Internet users, we are able to extract certain types of medical features to characterize user’s attributes from multiple sources. Initially, we construct a multiple affinity graph to describe a vast number of users’ relationships with each attribute. Afterwards, a graph-based clustering is conducted to group these massive number of users into multiple medically-aware social clusters. Based on these clusters, each user’s health status is determined by the user’s classified health level associated with his/her companions. Lastly, in order to combine the user health level from multiple attributes, a new multi-view medical attribute learning framework is presented. This framework automatically calculates the weight of each attribute. Comprehensive comparative studies on a real-world medical data set with millions of users have demonstrated the superiority and robustness of our approach.
