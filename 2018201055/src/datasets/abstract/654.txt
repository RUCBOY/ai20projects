Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) can increase access to treatment and assist in advance care planning. However, the development of a diagnostic system that d7oes not heavily depend on cognitive testing is a major challenge. We describe a diagnostic algorithm based solely on gait and machine learning to detect MCI and AD from healthy.
We collected “single-tasking” gait (walking) and “dual-tasking” gait (walking with cognitive tasks) from 32 healthy, 26 MCI, and 20 AD participants using a computerized walkway. Each participant was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). A set of gait features (e.g., mean, variance and asymmetry) were extracted. Significant features for three classifications of MCI/healthy, AD/healthy, and AD/MCI were identified. A support vector machine model in a one-vs.-one manner was trained for each classification, and the majority vote of the three models was assigned as healthy, MCI, or AD.
The average classification accuracy of 5-fold cross-validation using only the gait features was 78% (77% F1-score), which was plausible when compared with the MoCA score with 83% accuracy (84% F1-score). The performance of healthy vs. MCI or AD was 86% (88% F1-score), which was comparable to 88% accuracy (90% F1-score) with MoCA.
Our results indicate the potential of machine learning and gait assessments as objective cognitive screening and diagnostic tools.
Gait-based cognitive screening can be easily adapted into clinical settings and may lead to early identification of cognitive impairment, so that early intervention strategies can be initiated.
