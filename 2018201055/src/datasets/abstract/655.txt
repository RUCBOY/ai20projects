In this paper; we propose two new substitution schemes for digital audio watermarking based on the Fourier transform. The integration of the watermark will be performed by combining the parity of the successive coefficients values; each variant will represent a different combination. In our experiments several variants of the Fourier transform are used (Discrete Fourier Transform, a Fractional Fourier Transform as well as a Quaternion Discrete Fourier Transform). For each transform, both variants of our watermarking scheme are applied and the results obtained show that our approach offers good imperceptibility and generates watermarked audio sample robust against various attacks with a high-quality watermark. However, using small audio file for our experiments considerably reduces the capacity of our approach in the frequency domain.
