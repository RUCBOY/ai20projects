Millimeter-wave mesh backhaul network (mm-wave MBN) is a key potential technology for massive traffic backhaul in 5G and beyond. However, one of the most urgent challenges is the high capacity and green backhaul solution. To that end, a QoS-oriented joint optimization of concurrent scheduling and power control is investigated, where the QoS demands of the transmission flows are fully considered. Firstly, the QoS-oriented joint optimization problem of concurrent scheduling and power control is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, where the energy consumption is reduced and the number of the successfully transmitted flows is enhanced. Secondly, a heuristics and energy-efficient backhaul mechanism (HEBM) is proposed for the suboptimal solution obtained in polynomial time because that the formulated problem is a NP-hard problem. The HEBM is composed of two parts, i.e., concurrent scheduling algorithm and power control algorithm. In the first algorithm, the concurrent scheduling set is decided with the maximum independent set of the constructed conflict graph and the defined priority of the transmission flow. In the second algorithm, the transmission power of each flow is calculated. Thirdly, the relationship between the key threshold of HEBM and the transmission power is derived and verified. Finally, HEBM is compared with the state-of-the-arts and the superiority of HEBM is demonstrated through extensive simulations under various traffic modes and system parameters.
