Natural dyes have been the focus of textile industry for their environmental protection properties. However, some limitations such as poor photostability has limited their wide application, and the researches of the discoloration mechanism of fabric with natural dye are relatively limited. As one of the most important natural dye, madder has been widely used in textile field. Herein, as the main pigment of madder, alizarin was selected as the model natural dye to explore the photo-fading progress of alizarin-dyed fabrics. The photodegradation progress of alizarin was explored by UV, HPLC, HPLC-MS and Datacolor (computer color matching system). When exposed to light, alizarin could be oxidized into colorless small molecules through Â·OH radical-mediated route, and finally resulting in the fading of alizarin. In addition, the influence of pre-mordant and the liquid rate has also been studied. These results provide us a good insight into the photo-fading progress of natural dyes, and our work could help to open the way to further studies aiming at improving the photostability of natural dyes or developing new photo-stable dyes.
