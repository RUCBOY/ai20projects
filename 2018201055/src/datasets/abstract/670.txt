Despite the promising progress made in recent years, individual identification from biological motion remains a challenging task due to the drastic changes in human poses produced by various covariate factors. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to solve this challenging problem by extracting the invariant features of individuals. There exist two main bottlenecks for these methods. One is the large variability within each class; the other is that few methods have taken the spatio-temporal structure of biological motion into consideration. To address these problems, we propose a novel multi-factor spatio-temporal paradigm for individual identification that capture the entire spatio-temporal structure of the 3D biological motion. The first proposed approach, namely spatio-temporal multi-factor discriminant analysis (ST-MFDA), learns a set of paired factor-specific spatio-temporal projections to map motion features from different factors into a common discriminant subspace. Then, in the common subspace, features from the same individual are united and those from different individuals are separated by Fisher Discriminant Criterion. We prove that spatio-temporal projections of various factors can be jointly learnt by solving an iterative generalized eigenvalue problem. Beyond that, a bilinear classifier strategy is also incorporated into the proposed paradigm to resolve the influence of covariant factors. Similar to ST-MFDA, the multi-factor bilinear classifier can map the features from different factors into a common subspace, so that an unbiased classifier can be learned in the common space. Experimental results from four public databases demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches, and we find that the spatio-temporal projections trained in this way lead to significant improvements in identification accuracy.
