The Ethiopian hedgehog (Paraechinus aethiopicus) is an insectivore which is known to occur in northern an eastern Africa and in most of the Arabian Peninsula. Few recent studies on the reproduction, parasitology and ecology are available, but none has been published on the hematology and serum biochemistry reference intervals. Hence the present study was conducted in order to establish haematological and biochemical for free ranging apparently healthy hedgehogs using automated haematology and biochemistry analyzers. Variation and differences in blood values between males and females as well as before and after hibernation were evaluated. Blood samples from 50 males and 35 females were used for the establishment of the reference interval for the haematological and biochemical variables. Data from males and females were compared using student’s t-test in the computer program SPSS. Significant sex-related haematological differences were observed in the total WBCs, monocytes, RBCs, MCV and MCH values. Males showed significantly higher WBCs compared to females whereas females showed significantly higher values form monocytes, RBCs, MCV and MCH than males (p < 0.05–0001). Changes in the biochemical profiles were significant in AlP, BUN and Na. ALP and BUN were higher in males while Na was higher in females (p < 0.05–0.01). The effect of hibernation was evidenced by increase in the RBCs, haemoglobin, haematocrit and MCHC and decrease in the total protein and phosphorus in animals after hibernation. These findings are considered the first regarding the reference intervals for the desert hedgehog and it will constitute a basis for any further haematological and biochemical studies.
