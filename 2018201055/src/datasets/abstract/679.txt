An active amplitude-phase compensation method for energy flow convergence is derived. Here, we can actively interfere with the energy flow distribution of Airy beams (AiBs), without affecting their other excellent features, such as non-diffraction. Compared with the traditional method, distortion from phase term can be compensated by amplitude array, effectively converting the main lobes energy. In the process of light propagation, the rest intense lobes after modulating can still propagate without diffraction. Moreover, we demonstrate a variety of side lobes intensity patterns, providing diversity for optical tweeters technology.
