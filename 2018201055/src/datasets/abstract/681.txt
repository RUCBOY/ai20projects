Herein, we report on the facile soft chemical synthesis of hybrid interlinked ZnO nanotubes (HIZNTs) with dispersed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2). Nanostructures were grown under two different conditions, with and without the addition of MoS2 during the hydrothermal process. Systematic structural and material analysis of the MoS2-HIZNTs was conducted. Then, both the MoS2-HIZNTs and as-prepared ZnO nanotubes were fabricated with an interdigitated Pt electrode to produce materials for subsequent gas sensing studies. Remarkably, the MoS2-HIZNT hybrid materials exhibited an excellent sensing capability of 51.1%, significantly higher than that of the as-prepared ZNTs. The MoS2-HIZNT samples were tested using various concentrations of H2 from 10 to 500 ppm at room temperature. It is presumed that the larger surface area exhibited by the MoS2-HIZNTs allowed the adsorption of more gas ions leading to was a linear increase in oxygen vacancies and surface-active sites compared to the ZNTs. Also, the addition of MoS2 had a significant influence on the morphology, with a reduction in the wall thickness of the etched tubes. This reduced wall thickness of the MoS2-HIZNTs produced a striking improvement in the mobility of the electrons leading to no trapping of electrons at numerous sites and improved gas sensing performance. The results demonstrate the excellent MoS2-HIZNT hybrid materials for future gas sensor applications.
