How to effectively extract feature representations from unlabeled samples from the target domain is critical for unsupervised domain adaptation, specific for partial domain adaptation where source label space is a super-space of target label space, as it helps reduce large performance gap due to domain shift or domain bias. In this paper, a novel partial domain adaptation method named Multiple Self-Attention Networks (MSAN) based on adversarial learning is proposed. Unlike most existing partial domain adaptation methods which only focus on high-level features, MSAN focuses on effective high-level context features and low-level structural features from unlabeled target data with the help of labeled source data. Specifically, we present multiple self-attention network, a general approach to learning more fine-grained and transferable features in a manner of gradual feature enhancement so that domain shift can be relatively decreased to boost the model generalization power. Comprehensive experiments on Office-31 and Office-Home datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves upon representation partial domain adaptation methods to yield state-of-the-art results for various partial transfer tasks.
