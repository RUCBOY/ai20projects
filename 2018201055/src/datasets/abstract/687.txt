Cloud data auditing with file and authenticator deduplication can not only check the integrity of cloud data, but also reduce the cloudâ€™s storage overhead significantly. In this paper, we propose a cloud data auditing scheme supporting file and authenticator deduplication. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed scheme is the first practical one that truly achieves low-entropy security. For the file with low-entropy, the malicious cloud cannot forge any authenticator to pass the auditing verification. The proposed scheme is user-friendly. Users do not need to keep interacting with the Third Party Auditor (TPA) in the auditing phase. We give the detailed security proof to show that the proposed scheme is secure. Comprehensive experiments show the efficiency of our scheme.
