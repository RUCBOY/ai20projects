We propose a new local-binary ghost imaging by using point-by-point method. This method can compensate the degradation of imaging quality due to the loss of information during binarization process. The numerical and experimental results show that the target details can be reconstructed well by this method when compared with traditional ghost imaging. By comparing the differences of the speckle patterns from different binarization methods, we also give the corresponding explanation. Our results may have the potential applications in areas with high requirements for imaging details, such as target recognition.
