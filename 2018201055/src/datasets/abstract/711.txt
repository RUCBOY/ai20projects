In this paper, we construct complex weighted networks for seismicity based on spaceâ€“time influence domain for three different regions and study the properties and correlations present in the networks. It is shown that links with high weight take a certain proportion in the networks. The results show that degree distribution, weight distribution, and nodal strength distribution of the weighted networks all obey power-law distribution for the three regions. Both the unweighted and weighted networks are found to be assortative mixing and hierarchical. On observation of the evolution of the average nodal strength and the strength of node that contains main shock, we find that they show an increasing trend before main shock from the data of California. The weighted form of earthquake network may be helpful to study the interactions between seismic activities and to model seismicity by complex networks.
