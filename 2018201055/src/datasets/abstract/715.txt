Optical fiber tendencies are pushing for changes towards upgrading scalability, agility, and unwavering quality for multi-hungry bandwidth applications. In the quest for future proof of those multi-hungry bandwidth applications, is vital to take advantage of new multiplexing technologies as the surge of network traffic that soon will overwhelm the capacity of multimode fiber (MMF). Due to the issue of MMF modal dispersion and mode coupling that caused Intersymbol Interference (ISI) which result in bandwidth degradation and limited range of length. Thus, Mode division-multiplexing (MDM) is a significant and elegant emerging technology, which harnesses the symmetry of modes by transmitting in parallel data through different modes. This paper models and analysis novel four-mode group demultiplexing MDM-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to isolate the signals and fairly distribute the power to the system sub-channels, each to their respective groups. The novel MDM based-SVD system achieved an aggregated data rate of 100 Gbit/s on wavelengths 1550.12 nm over an existed graded-index MMF length of 3000 m. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated through channel impulse response, channel spectrum, eye diagram, and Bit-Error-Rate (BER) matrices.
