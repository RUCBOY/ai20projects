The ability to operate on a successful, strategic planning should include maintenance and reliability through enhanced operational considerations asset availability. To solve vessel inspection, identify high-risk vessels, vessel inspection-related issues, strengthen unity and cooperation to integrate maritime stakeholders, avoid ship accidents, and promote safety at sea and protect the environment. The current study included data requirements for machinery and equipment specifications and stakeholders. Focus on the methodological point of view, the Ship automatic detection (SHM) model is introduced. Methods All of progress and development takes place in the Java programming language. Overall, the results of this study show that the reliability of marine machinery parts. Future developments include the design-time components by the user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) dynamic interdependence failure rate variations, the probability model sensitivity analysis, and systems.
