In this paper, we propose an efficient and practical implementation of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) via the distribution-free Ledoit and Wolf (LW) covariance matrix estimator. Initially, we develop a tractable implementation of the LW estimator in high-dimensional probability spaces such as those found in the context of operational data assimilation. We employ this well-conditioned, full-rank covariance matrix estimator to approximate background error covariances and to mitigate the impact of spurious correlations during assimilation steps. The proposed formulation can be coupled within the EnKF framework to derive a matrix-free implementation via an iterative Woodbury formula. Experimental tests are performed by using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model. The numerical results are compared with those of the EnKF based on the Raoâ€“Blackwell Ledoit, and Wolf covariance matrix estimator (EnKF-RBLW) wherein Gaussian assumptions are a must on prior members. The outcomes reveal that the use of the proposed filter can mitigate the impact of spurious correlations during assimilation stages, and even more, the proposed method can improve on the results of the EnKF-RBLW as a consequence of the Gaussian relaxation on prior errors.
