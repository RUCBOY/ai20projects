The paper proposes a new approach to the solution of standard and block tridiagonal systems that appear in various areas of technical, scientific and financial practice. Its goal is to elaborate an efficient two-phase tridiagonal solver, the particular case of which is the k-step cyclic reduction. The main idea of the proposed approach to designing a two-phase tridiagonal solver lies in using new model equations for dyadic system reduction. The resulting solver differs from the known two-phase partitioning ones also in the second phase, since it uses a series of simple explicit formulas for calculation of the remaining unknown values. Computational experiments on measuring speedup confirmed the efficiency of the proposed solver.
