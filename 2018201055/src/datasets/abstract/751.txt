The theory of three-way decision plays an important role in decision making and knowledge reasoning. However, little attention has been paid to the problem of learning from partially labeled data with three-way decision. In this paper, we propose a three-way co-decision model for partially labeled data. More specifically, the problem of attribute reduction for partially labeled data is first investigated, and two semi-supervised attribute reduction algorithms based on novel confidence discernibility matrix are proposed. Then, a three-way co-decision model is introduced to classify unlabeled data into useful, useless, and uncertain data, and the model is iteratively retrained on the carefully selected useful data to improve its performance. Moreover, we theoretically analyze the effectiveness of the proposed model. The experimental results conducted on UCI data sets demonstrate that the proposed model is promising, and even compares favourably with the single supervised classifier trained on all training data with true labels.
