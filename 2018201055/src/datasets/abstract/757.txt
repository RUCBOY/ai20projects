To meet the exascale I/O requirements for the High-Performance Computing (HPC), a new I/O subsystem, Burst Buffer, based on solid state drives (SSD), has been developed. However, the diverse HPC workloads and the bursty I/O pattern cause severe data fragmentation that requires costly garbage collection (GC) and increases the number of bytes written to the SSD. To address this data fragmentation challenge, a new multi-stream feature has been developed for SSDs. In this work, we develop an I/O Separation scheme called BIOS to leverage this multi-stream feature to group the I/O streams based on the user IDs. We propose a stream-aware scheduling policy based on burst buffer pools in the workload manager, and integrate the BIOS with the workload manager to optimize the I/O separation scheme in burst buffer. We evaluate the proposed framework with a burst buffer I/O traces from Cori Supercomputer including a diverse set of applications. Experimental results show that the BIOS could improve the performance by 1.44x on average and reduce the Write Amplification Factor (WAF) by up to 1.20x. These demonstrate the potential benefits of the I/O separation scheme for solid state storage systems.
