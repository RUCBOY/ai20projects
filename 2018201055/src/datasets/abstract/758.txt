In this paper, an 85 GHz MM-wave signal is demonstrated in the fiber and MM-wave converged system in W-band. It is known to us, this is the first experimental demonstration that the pre-equalizaiton (PE) and probabilistic shaping (PS) techniques are applied to the fiber and MM-wave converged system. BER of 4.4 × 10−3 is achieved by using those method after 4-m wireless transmission and 25-km Standard single mode fiber (SSMF).
