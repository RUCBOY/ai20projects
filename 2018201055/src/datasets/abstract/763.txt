In this study, we propose a new IsoGeometric formulation based on Refined Zigzag Theory (RZT), abbreviated as IG-RZT, for static analysis of laminated plates and sandwich panels with curvilinear fiber paths for the first time in literature. The original RZT formulation defines constant, linear, and zigzag deformation contributions of thickness coordinate to the in-plane displacements. This kinematic relation can accurately predict in-plane displacement of composite with straight fibers. However, estimating a realistic variation of in-plane displacements in a variable angle tow (VAT) composite is a more challenging problem as compared to the straight fiber composites. This difficulty has been addressed herein by including a quartic (fourth-order) polynomial thickness expansion that includes the transverse normal strain effects to the kinematic displacement fields of RZT. Moreover, the modelling of VAT composites results in the RZT zigzag functions to depend not only on the thickness coordinate but also on the in-plane positions. The present IG-RZT methodology is free of shear-locking and shear correction factors due to the integration of RZT with Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) functions of isogeometric analysis. The use of NURBS functions also enable the exact geometry data to be taken directly from a computer aided design (CAD) software, e.g., Rhinoceros, into an in-house Mathematica code. The accuracy and efficiency of the present IG-RZT formulation is assessed and validated by solving various examples of curvilinear fiber laminated plates with different aspect and span-to-thickness ratios. Comparison of IG-RZT results with reference solutions available in literature and generated by a commercial software (ANSYS) using 3D finite elements have demonstrated the remarkable benefits of the proposed IG-RZT method for predicting highly accurate both displacement and stress distributions of VAT composite structures.
