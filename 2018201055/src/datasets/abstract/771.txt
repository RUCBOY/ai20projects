Shape similarity is a fundamental problem in geometry processing, enabling applications such as surface correspondence, segmentation, and edit propagation. For example, a user may paint a stroke on one finger of a model and desire the edit to propagate to all fingers. Automatic approaches have difficulty matching user expectations, either due to an algorithmâ€™s inability to guess the scale at which the user is intending to edit or due to underlying deficiencies in the similarity metric (e.g., semantic information not present in the geometry).
We propose an approach to interactively design self-similarity maps. We investigate two primitive operations, useful in a variety of scenarios: region and curve similarity. Users select example similar and dissimilar regions. Starting with an automatically generated multi-scale shape signature, our approach solves for a scale parameter and thresholds that group the example regions as specified. We propose a new Smooth Shape Diameter Signature (SSDS) as a more efficient alternative to the Heat or Wave Kernel Signature. If no such parameters can be found, our approach modifies the shape signature itself. Given a curve drawn on the surface, we perform hybrid discrete/continuous optimization to find similar curves elsewhere.
We apply our approach for interactive editing scenarios: propagating mesh geometry, patterns duplication, and segmentation.
