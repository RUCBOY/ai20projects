In this work, we present the experimental optical trap of microparticles with an Airy beams array using holographic optical tweezers. The Airy beams array is attractive for optical manipulation of particles owing to their non–diffracting and autofocusing properties. An Airy beams array is composed of N Airy beams which accelerate mutually and symmetrically in opposite direction, for different ballistic trajectories, that is, with different initial launch angles. Based on this, we developed a holographic optical tweezers system for the generation of non–diffracting beams and with it, we investigate the distribution of optical forces acting on microparticles of an Airy beams array. The results show that the gradient and scattering force on microparticles can be controlled through a launch angle parameter of Airy beams. In addition, it is possible to obtain greater stability for optical trap using an Airy beams array, with interesting possibilities for trapping and guiding of microparticles in a controllable way that can be applied in optical, biological, and atmospheric sciences.
