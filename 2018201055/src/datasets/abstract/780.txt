Two case studies explore disciplinary identity construction by examining two Chinese undergraduates’ personal statement writing. Drawing upon Thompson’s model (2012), an analytical framework of three voice levels was proposed to analyze the students’ disciplinary identity construction. It is found that the writers voiced their disciplinary identity propositionally, structurally and holistically. Interview data reveal that the writers voiced the intended disciplinary identity of being disciplinarily capable and personally unique to gain membership into the target disciplinary communities. The pedagogical implications for voice construction in academic writing teaching and learning are addressed.
