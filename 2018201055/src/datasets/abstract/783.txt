The outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its pandemic effects have created a demand for essential medical equipment. To date, there are no specific, clinically significant licensed drugs and vaccines available for COVID-19. Hence, mapping out COVID-19 problems and preventing the spread with relevant technology are very urgent. This study is a review of the work done till October, 2020 on solving COVID-19 with 3D printing. Many patients who need to be hospitalized because of COVID-19 can only survive on bio-macromolecules antiviral respiratory assistance and other medical devices. A bio-cellular face shield with relative comfortability made of bio-macromolecules polymerized polyvinyl chloride (BPVC) and other biomaterials are produced with 3D printers. Summarily, it was evident from this review study that additive manufacturing (AM) is a proffered technology for efficient production of an improved bio-macromolecules capable of significant COVID-19 test and personal protective equipment (PPE) to reduce the effect of COVID-19 on the world economy. Innovative AM applications can play an essential role to combat invisible killers (COVID-19) and its hydra-headed pandemic effects on humans, economics and society.
