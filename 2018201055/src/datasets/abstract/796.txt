This article describes a novel digital L-band EPR spectrometer. The spectrometer uses direct digital detection with time-locked subsampling (TLSS). The device consists of a microwave bridge equipped with a microwave source based on direct digital synthesis (DDS) and a digital receiver.
DDS technology combined with an ultra-low noise 1 GHz master clock allowed the development of a digitally controlled microwave source with exceptionally good phase noise characteristics. The obtained level of phase noise is as low as −140 dBc/Hz at 30.5 kHz from the carrier frequency of 1.15 GHz, which is important when registering the EPR dispersion signal.
The receiver is equipped with a high-speed A/D converter that enables direct digitalization of the L-band microwave signal. The obtained discrete data are then buffered and averaged in a programmable logic FPGA device. Data packets from FPGA are transferred to a DSP microcontroller that correlates them with the appropriate reference signals. This detection algorithm requires time locking of the generator and the receiver, which is ensured by clocking both devices from the same reference source. This procedure allows the simultaneous detection of the absorption and dispersion signals at the magnetic field modulation frequency and at any of its harmonics.
The software to control the spectrometer was designed in the LabView programming environment. The program also allows further data processing. To the best of our knowledge, the described spectrometer is one of the first full implementation of the direct digital detection technique which could replace conventional analog CW spectrometers that utilize magnetic field modulation. For an 11 µm aqueous TEMPOL solution, the new spectrometer obtained a S/N ratio greater than 160 for an EPR spectrum registered in 69 s.
