Data center profits are directly impacted by electric power consumption, which in turn has critical environmental implications. Geo distributed data centers maximize profits by optimizing resource allocation and leveraging diverse power tariffs available in a deregulated market. However, a power network state apathetic profit maximization can destabilize the grid and hamper a data center's sustainability goals. In this paper, we formulate the data center profit maximization as a constrained optimization problem. We then propose a multi-level algorithm where the lower level scheme is based on evolutionary optimization. The algorithm simultaneously optimizes revenue and expenses while preserving QoS and power network stability. The proposed approach considers real-time demand-based energy price variations to orchestrate request routing and resource allocation. The approach is suitable for heterogeneous and homogeneous data center architectures. The proposed scheme is also thermal-aware and considers both computing and cooling consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed technique is effective; it achieves a higher profit over a broad range of price variations and data center utilization levels.
