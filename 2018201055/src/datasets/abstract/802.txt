Density peaks clustering (DPC) algorithm is an efficient and simple clustering method attracting the attention of many researchers. However, its strategy of assigning each non-grouped object to the same cluster depends on its nearest neighbors having a higher local density. This may lead to the cluster label error propagation problem, i.e. if an object is wrong-labeled during the clustering process, its label will be propagated in the subsequent assignment. To overcome this defect, in this paper we propose a three-way density peak clustering method based on evidence theory, referred to as 3W-DPET. 3W-DPET forms clusters as interval sets using three-way clustering representation including three disjoint regions called positive region (POS), boundary region (BND) and negative region (NEG). 3W-DPET mainly consists of three steps: (1) finding out cluster centers and noises before clustering; (2) using a midrange distance comparison method to detect positive regions of clusters; and (3) allocating the remaining non-grouped objects, including noises, to the boundary region or the negative region of clusters. The distinguishing feature of 3W-DPET is that evidence theory is used to construct and collect the information of K-nearest neighbors in order to assign non-grouped objects to the most suitable cluster, which can effectively solve the problem of cluster label error propagation. In order to validate 3W-DPET, we test it on 18 datasets using three benchmarks (ACC, ARI and NMI), and compare it to K-means, FCM, DPC, KNN-DPC, DPCSA, SNN-DPC and CE3-kmeans methods. Experimental results suggest that 3W-DPET can effectively find clusters and its results conform with human cognition.
