Impressive progress has been made recently in image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks (GANs). However, existing methods often fail in translating source images with noise to target domain. To address this problem, we joint image-to-image translation with image denoising and propose an enhanced generative adversarial network (EGAN). In particular, built upon pix2pix, we introduce residual blocks in the generator network to capture deeper multi-level information between source and target image distribution. Moreover, a perceptual loss is proposed to enhance the performance of image-to-image translation. As demonstrated through extensive experiments, our proposed EGAN can alleviate effects of noise in source images, and outperform other state-of-the-art methods significantly. Furthermore, we experimentally indicate that the proposed EGAN is also effective when applied to image denoising.
