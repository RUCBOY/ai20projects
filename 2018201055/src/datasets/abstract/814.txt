In response to organizationsâ€™ increasing vulnerability to data breaches, we present an integrated risk model for data breach management based on a systematic review of the literature. Theoretically, the study extends the body of knowledge on data breach management by identifying and updating conceptualizations of data breach risks (items) and resolutions (actions) and by providing a foundation for organizational responses to emerging data breach incidents (heuristics). Practically, the study provides key insights that practitioners can use to organize and orchestrate effective data breach management based on comprehensive profiles of risk items and resolution techniques.
