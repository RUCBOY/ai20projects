Forecasts of residual demand curves (RDCs) are valuable information for price-maker market agents since it enables an assessment of their bidding strategy in the market-clearing price. This paper describes the application of deep learning techniques, namely long short-term memory (LSTM) network that combines past RDCs and exogenous variables (e.g., renewable energy forecasts). The main contribution is to build up on the idea of transforming the temporal sequence of RDCs into a sequence of images, avoiding any feature reduction and exploiting the capability of LSTM in handling image data. The proposed method was tested with data from the Iberian day-ahead electricity market and outperformed machine learning models with an improvement of above 35% in both root mean square error and Fr√®chet distance.
