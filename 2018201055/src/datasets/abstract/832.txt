Physical and cognitive impairments decline the ability of elderly in execution of daily activities, such as eating, sleeping or taking medication. The proposed approach recognizes the activities performed in a smart home, and separates the normal from the anomalous activities. Moreover, we identify the anomalous days based on the number of activities performed in a day. We perform activity recognition by applying probabilistic neural network on the pre-segmented activity-data obtained from the sensors deployed at different locations in a smart home. We use H2O autoencoder to identify the anomalous from the normal instances of activities. We further categorize the anomalies based on the criteria such as missing or extra subevents, and unusual duration of activity. Since the ground truth of the anomalies is unavailable, we generate the ground truth using the boxplots of the duration, and the number of subevents in an activity. We provide the quantified results of activity recognition and anomaly detection that can be further used by the research community. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach on two publicly available CASAS smart home datasets demonstrates its ability in the activity recognition and the correct identification of anomalies.
