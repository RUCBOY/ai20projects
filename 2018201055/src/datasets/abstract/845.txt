Recently popularized Graph Neural Network (GNN) has been attaching great attention along with its successful industry applications. This paper focuses on two challenges traditional GNN frameworks face: (i) most of them are transductive and mainly concentrate on homogeneous networks considering single typed nodes and edges; (ii) they are difficult to handle the real-time changing network structures as well as scale to big graph data. To address these issues, a novel attention-based Heterogeneous Multi-view Graph Neural Network (aHMGNN) solution is introduced. aHMGNN models a more intricate heterogeneous multi-view network, where various node and edge types co-exist and each of these objects also contain specific attributes. It is end-to-end, and two stages are designed for node embeddings learning and multi-typed node and edge representations fusion, respectively. Experimental studies on large-scale spam detection and link prediction tasks clearly verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed aHMGNN. Furthermore, we have implemented our approach in one of the largest e-commerce platforms which further verifies that aHMGNN is arguably promising and scalable in real-world applications.
