In this study, main concern is focused on numerically solving the integro-differential-delay equations with variable coefficients and infinite boundary on half-line, proposing a matrix-collocation method based on the orthoexponential polynomials. The method is equipped with the collocation points and the hybridized matrix relations between the orthoexponential and Taylor polynomials, which enable us to convert an integral form with infinite boundary into a mathematical formulation. The method also directly establishes the verification of the existence and uniqueness of this integral form through a convergent result. In order to observe the validity of the method versus its computation limit, an error bound analysis is performed by using the upper bound of the orthoexponential polynomials. A computer module containing main infrastructure of the method is specifically designed and run for providing highly precise results. Thus, the numerical and graphical implementations are completely monitored in table and figures, respectively. Based on the comparisons and findings, one can state that the method is remarkable, dependable, and accurate for approaching the aforementioned equations.
