The Max k-Uncut problem arose from the study of homophily of large-scale networks. Given an n-vertex undirected graph G=(V,E) with nonnegative weights defined on edges and a positive integer k, the Max k-Uncut problem asks to find a partition {V1,V2,⋯,Vk} of V such that the total weight of edges that are not cut is maximized. This problem is the complement of the classic Min k-Cut problem, and was proved to have surprisingly rich connection to the Densest k-Subgraph problem. In this paper, we give an approximation algorithm for Max k-Uncut using a non-uniform approach combining LP-rounding and the greedy strategy. The algorithm partitions the vertices of G into at least (1−1e)k parts in expectation, and achieves a good expected approximation ratio 12(1+(n−kn)2).
