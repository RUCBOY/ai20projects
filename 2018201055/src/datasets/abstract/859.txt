The maintenance of pharmacological torpor and hypothermia (body temperature 28 °C - 33 °C) in rats for a week is presented. For this purpose, our laboratory has developed a device (BioFeedback-2) for the feed-back controlled multiple injections of small doses of a pharmacological composition that we created earlier. On the 7th day, the rat spontaneously come out of the pharmacological torpor, the body temperature returned to normal, and on the 8th day, the animal could consume food and water. The proposed approach for maintaining multi-day pharmacological torpor can be applied in medicine, as well as for protecting astronauts during long missions in space.
