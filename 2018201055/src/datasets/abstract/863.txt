Node centrality plays an important role in many dynamical processes taking place on complex networks. In this work, we associate the individuals’ collective influence (CI) with their strategy-updating time scales to investigate how the diverse collective influence of individuals affects the evolution of cooperation in the evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma game on scale-free networks. With the combination of time scale mechanism which bridges the feedback between strategy-updating time scale and the performance of individuals, we find that influential cooperators locating at medium- or small-degrees are able to spread their behaviors among neighbors in a more efficient way than hubs with large-degrees. Hence, collective influence with proper path length can efficiently identify influencers and may promote the emergence of cooperation on heterogeneous interaction networks.
