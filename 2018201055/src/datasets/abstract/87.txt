DNA Computing is still at its infant stage since its emergence. Multiple aspects of DNA computing have been studied but most of the research results have not been applied to the reality. It has been proved to exhibit high data storage density and support efficient random data access. It also shows the potential to provide alternative facilities for general computing. Especially, its natural double-helix structure enables it to be the best fit for high-throughput parallel computing. However, the underlying rationale of DNA computing is different from the existing electronic computing devices. Therefore, the popularity of DNA computing device is limited by its accessibility. We propose our designs for high-throughput DNA computing including DNA computing circuits, system architecture, and its compiler. We also demonstrate its feasibility using a simple example through simulation experiments. The objective of this framework is to bridge the gap between the existing computer developer community and the DNA computing biotechnology.
