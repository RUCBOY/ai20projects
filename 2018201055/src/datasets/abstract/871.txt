The Matthew effect and the halo effect have been elaborated upon, applied, and occasionally misused. Inspired by prior studies, this study aims to revisit this important issue. Specifically, this study not only reexamines the association between both effects and scholars’ future research funding but also investigates the moderation effect of scholars’ experience on this association. The data are collected from three different sources, including data from 1085 research projects from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan. The results show that the Matthew effect and halo effect are indeed advantageous to scholars seeking an increase in research funding, and these effects increase both the amount and the duration of research funding. In addition, the proposed associations are partially moderated by the scholar’s experience in applying for research funding. The findings have several theoretical and practical implications that are relevant to funding in science.
