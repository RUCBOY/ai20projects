Szemer√©di's regularity lemma is one instance in a family of regularity lemmas, replacing the definition of density of a graph by a more general coefficient. Recently, Fan Chung proved another instance, a regularity lemma for clustering graphs, and asked whether good upper bounds could be derived for the quantitative estimates it supplies. We answer this question in the negative, for every generalized regularity lemma.
