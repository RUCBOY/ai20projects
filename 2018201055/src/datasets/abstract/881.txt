In this article, conservation laws and exact analytical solutions of resonant nonlinear Schrödinger's equation with parabolic nonlinearity are discussed. we implemented Modified Kudryashov algorithm and exp(−ϕ(Ψ))-expansion algorithm for calculating the exact solutions. We applied the transformation W(x,t)=A(x,t)eiB(x,t) to our original equation which convert it into a system. Then conservation laws are achieved with multiplier method. These results are useful in optical fibres and Medeling fluids problems.
