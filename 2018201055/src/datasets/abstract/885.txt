With an ever-increasing number of synthetic chemicals being manufactured, it is unrealistic to expect that they will all be subjected to comprehensive and effective risk assessment. A shift from conventional animal testing to computer-aided methods is therefore an important step towards advancing the environmental risk assessments of chemicals. The aims of this study are two-fold: firstly, it examines the relationships between structural and physicochemical features of a diverse set of organic chemicals, and their acute aquatic toxicity towards Daphnia magna and Oryzias latipes using a classification tree approach. Secondly, it compares the efficiency and accuracy of the predictions of two modeling schemes: local models that are inherently restricted to a smaller subset of structurally-related substances, and a global model that covers a wider chemical space and a number of modes of toxic action. The classification tree-based models differentiate the organic chemicals into either 'highly toxic' or 'low to non-toxic' classes, based on internal and external validation criteria. These mechanistically-driven models, which demonstrate good performance, reveal that the key factors driving acute aquatic toxicity are lipophilicity, electrophilic reactivity, molecular polarizability and size. A comparative analysis of the performance of the two modeling schemes indicates that the local models, trained on homogeneous data sets, are less error prone, and therefore superior to the global model. Although the global models showed worse performance metrics compared to the local ones, their applicability domain is much wider, thereby significantly increasing their usefulness in practical applications for regulatory purposes. This demonstrates their advantage over local models and shows they are an invaluable tool for modeling heterogeneous chemical data sets.
