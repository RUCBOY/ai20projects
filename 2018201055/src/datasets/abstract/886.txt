A regularized method of moments based on the modified fundamental solution of the Helmholtz equation is proposed in this article. The regularized method of moments uses the origin intensity factor technique which is free of mesh and integration to deal with the singularity at origin of the basis function. Thus, the time-consuming singular integration can be avoided. In addition, the non-uniqueness at internal resonance is also fixed using the constructed modified fundamental solution. In comparison with the traditional method of moments, the regularized method of moments can reduce the computational time by half, while the stability and accuracy stay about the same. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the regularized method of moments can accurately and efficiently compute the radar cross section of perfect conducting scatter in all frequency ranges.
