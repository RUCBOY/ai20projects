Network of computers are vulnerable to attack by virulent codes which can halt an organization’s activities and in the process resulting in loss of revenue. The need to understand their dynamics if utmost importance and hence there is a need to develop mathematical models. These models will help us understand the impact these virulent codes have on the network of computers. In this article, we develop and solve numerically a mathematical model which can be used to understand the dynamics of a virulent code in a network of computers. This model is called the Immune, susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantine, and recovered (MSEIQR). The model is solved using a very robust spectral method called the piecewise pseudospectral relaxation method (PPRM). PPRM accuracy is validated by comparing the results with the standard Runge–Kutta method. Stability analysis is also performed on the modified MSEIQR model for malicious code. Results generated are in agreement with the stability analysis performed. Results showing effect of crucial parameters in the dynamics of the model are presented in graphical form.
