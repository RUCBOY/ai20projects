Text mining has not yet been fully explored in fisheries scientific literature and applications in existing studies have been limited. In the present study, quantitative text analysis was used in order to identify various subtopic trends and gaps in the knowledge of the fisheries science field. Several multivariate and descriptive analyses —including word extraction, word association, cluster analysis, co-occurrence network and correspondence analysis— were used for this purpose. Common words existed between periods, while each period was also characterized by unique words. Cluster analysis revealed four major thematic groups of words during the period 1971–2020. Categorization of words in eight major subsets highlighted the diachronically significant positively increasing engagement of literature with the ecological, economic and social dimension of fisheries science. A constant progress has been done in the field of fisheries management and in the use of functions/equations. Correspondence analysis indicated relationships between two decades, from 2001 to 2010 and from 2011 to present.
