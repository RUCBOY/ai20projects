Patients and physicians engaging together in the electronic health record (EHR) during clinical visits may provide opportunities to both improve patient understanding and reduce medical errors.
To assess the potential impact of a patient EHR display intervention on patient quality and safety. We hypothesized that if patients had a dedicated display with an explicit invitation to follow clinicians in the EHR that this would identify several opportunities to engage patients in their care quality and safety.
Physician-patient outpatient encounters (24 patients and 8 physicians) were videotaped. Encounters took place in a hospital-based general internal medicine outpatient clinic where physicians and patients had their respective EHR monitors. Following the visits, each patient and physician was interviewed for 30â€¯min to understand their perception of the mirrored-screen setting.
The following 7 themes were identified (a) curiosity, (b) opportunity to ask questions, (c) error identification, (d) control over medications, (e) awareness, (f) shared understanding & decision-making, (g) data privacy. These themes collectively comprised a conceptual model for how patient engagement in electronic health record use, through a dedicated second screen or an explicitly shared screen, relates to safety and quality opportunities. Therefore, the double EHR screen provides an explicit invitation for patients to join the process to influence safety.
Desired outcomes include real-time error identification and better-shared understanding and decision-making, leading to better downstream follow-through with care plans.
