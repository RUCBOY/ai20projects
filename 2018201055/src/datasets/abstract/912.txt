Graphene is considered as a promising material in spintronics due to its long spin relaxation time and long spin relaxation length. However, its spin transport properties have been studied at low carrier density only, beyond which much is still unknown. In this study, we explore the spin transport and spin precession properties in multilayer graphene at high carrier density using ionic liquid gating. We find that the spin relaxation time is directly proportional to the momentum relaxation time, indicating that the Elliott-Yafet mechanism still dominates the spin relaxation in multilayer graphene away from the charge neutrality point.
