The detection and pathogenic factors analysis of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD) has a practical significance for its diagnosis and treatment. However, the traditional research paradigms are commonly based on single neural imaging data, which is easy to ignore the complementarity between multimodal imaging genetics data. The existing researches also pay little attention to the comprehensive framework of patient detection and pathogenic factors analysis for PD. Based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data, a novel brain disease multimodal data analysis model is proposed in this paper. Firstly, according to the complementarity between the two types of data, the classical correlation analysis method is used to construct the fusion feature of subjects. Secondly, based on the artificial neural network, the fusion feature analysis tool named clustering evolutionary random neural network ensemble (CERNNE) is designed. This method integrates multiple neural networks constructed randomly, and uses clustering evolution strategy to optimize the ensemble learner by adaptive selective integration, selecting the discriminative features for PD analysis and ensuring the generalization performance of the ensemble model. By combining with data fusion scheme, the CERNNE is applied to forming a multi-task analysis framework, recognizing PD patients and predicting PD-associated brain regions and genes. In the multimodal data experiment, the proposed framework shows better classification performance and pathogenic factors predicting ability, which provides a new perspective for the diagnosis of PD.
