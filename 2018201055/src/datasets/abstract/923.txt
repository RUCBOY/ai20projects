The study investigated effects of electrode material, inter-electrode distance (IED), and conductive gel on electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded from the masseter muscle.
EMG was recorded unilaterally, as ten volunteers performed standardized oral tasks. Ag/AgCl and Ag coated with Au were the gel-based; Ag alloy coated with graphene, pure Ag coated with graphene and silver nanowire embedded electrodes were the gel-free materials tested. Ag/AgCl electrodes were tested at three different IEDs (i.e. 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm). An electrode relative performance index (ERPI) was defined and calculated for each of the standardized oral tasks that the volunteers performed. ERPI values obtained for the different oral tasks with different electrode materials and IEDs were compared using two-way repeated-measures ANOVA.
ERPI values were not significantly influenced by IED. However, for the electrode materials statistically significant differences were found in ERPI values for all oral tasks. Of the gel-free electrode materials tested, pure silver electrodes coated with graphene had the highest ERPI values followed by Ag alloy electrodes coated with graphene and silver nanowire embedded electrodes.
Within the limitations of the study, IED between 15 and 25 mm has a negligible effect on masseter muscle EMG. Graphene coated and silver nanowire embedded electrodes show promise as gel-free alternatives.
