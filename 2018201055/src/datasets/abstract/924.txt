A new method for the manufacturing of pre-determined open porosity Al foams is presented in this work. Starting from a 3D foam model designed with CAD and printed with fused deposition modeling (FDM), a porous structure of poly lactic acid (PLA) has been replicated. The choice of this material has been driven by the properties in terms of recyclability and low cost. The truncated octahedron for the porosity shape has been selected due to benefit and properties ascribable to its morphology. After creating the 3D PLA model, it has been filled with liquid plaster. After its solidification, PLA is removed in oven at 600 °C so that a negative-shaped plaster mold is obtained. Successively liquid Al at 750 °C is poured in the mold inside the oven. After Al solidification, plaster can be easily removed in ultrasonic bath thus obtaining Al foam with the same morphology of the starting PLA model. This process shows great flexibility allowing to manufacture different kind of elementary cell types. Tailoring of the selected properties of the manufactured foams, e.g. the morphology, the density or the surface/volume ratio may be obtained. With this technique many other metals and alloys can be manufactured too. The potential of this production technique can be successfully employed in many application fields of metal foam. Light-weight 3D lattice structures are widely employed for multifunctional applications such as loading bearing, negative and zero thermal-expansion structures, vibration attenuation, impact and blast proof structures.
