VLSI mask optimization is one of the most critical stages in manufacturability aware design, which is costly due to the complicated mask optimization and lithography simulation. Recent researches have shown prominent advantages of machine learning techniques dealing with complicated and big data problems, which bring potential of dedicated machine learning solution for DFM problems and facilitate the VLSI design cycle. However, uncertainty nature of state-of-the-art machine learning models have posed great challenges when developing alternative solutions. In this paper, we focus on a heterogeneous OPC framework that assists mask layout optimization. Instead of fitting neural networks for mask optimization tasks directly, a multi-class classification model is developed to capture design characteristics and hence determine the most suitable OPC engines. Experimental results have shown the efficiency and effectiveness of proposed frameworks that have the potential to be alternatives to existing EDA solutions.
