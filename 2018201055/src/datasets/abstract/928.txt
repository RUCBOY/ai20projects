The educative game market is on the rise. However, research about digital resources that go beyond the common core standards, like games on news education, is still lacking.

This paper helps educators and game developers improving digital platforms to extend news literacy education among children, by providing a list of 11 best formats to include in the design of such platforms. This study is the culmination of wider research that, using a mixed methods approach, included a formative evaluation of games available in the market, the creation of a new prototype, its piloting and its testing among a group of 50 children.
