It presents a way to build support for knowledge, analytical reasoning and explore analysis methods in visual text analysis. To do this, use automatically from the use of semantic network model parameters K- unstructured text data obtained for the neighbourhood. Semantic network analysis and network analysis methods to obtain quantitative and qualitative insights. Qualitative analysis and quantitative indicators to explore the semantic structure can support it. have discussed the basic theoretical assumptions about the text modelling to analyse the semantic network and subsequent semantic network. For a systematic overview, demonstrated the essential network elements of the qualitative meaning, which means the network analysis, to understand the meaning of a given network, support analyst doing. Possible exploration strategy. As proof of concept, use a visual survey and analysis of the semantic network. To explain the method proposed a typical analysis of the Wikipedia article, use the visual text analysis system.
