The interest in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks (MWSN) has grown considerably due to its various applications in the fields of military, industrial infrastructure, automation, health, traffic, and many consumer areas. Hence, as the modern world shifting to the age of IoT with possibly new emerging technologies and applications, there will be a number of implications that influence the design and deployment of such networks. Precisely, residual energy utilization, mobility, topology, scalability, and data routing are key factors in the design of MWSN to meet application's specific demand. This article presents a novel routing protocol that adapt to the mobility of sensor nodes to achieve a reliable and energy-efficient routing. The proposed scheme is dynamic directional routing (DDR) to control the flow of data in network, which optimizes the routes toward the sink. The protocol has been evaluated and compared with state-of-art protocols, and the simulation results show that DDR protocol can improve network lifetime by around 13% compared to T-LEACH protocol. It also enhances the packet delivery rate, energy consumption, while maintain shorter routes toward the sink by around 33% compared to T-LEACH protocol.
