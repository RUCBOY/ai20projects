In this work, a modified regularized lattice Boltzmann model is constructed for convection–diffusion equation (CDE) with a source term. By modifying the nonequilibrium part of the total distribution function, the present model can recover the target CDE with no deviation term through the Chapman–Enskog analysis. We then test the present model by considering a CDE with a constant velocity. Based on the numerical results, the present model is found to have better numerical stability and accuracy over the traditional Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook model, and we also note that the present model has a comparable numerical accuracy in contrast to the classical multiple-relaxation-time model.
