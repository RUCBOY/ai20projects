In order to perform a simple design of topological edge states, we construct two-dimensional triangular lattices with reversed scatterers and matrix materials. As the p and d orbits in the two lattices are reversed, the topologically trivial and non-trivial states can directly be formed without any intermediate transition. The topological edge states occur at the interface between the two lattices. Our simulation results have demonstrated the existence of the pseudospin states and the spin-locked propagation with topological protection and intense field localization at the boundary.
