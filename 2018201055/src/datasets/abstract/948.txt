Two series of FeCoNiPdx and CrxFeCoNiPd high entropy alloys were investigated using SEM-EDX, XRD technique and Mössbauer spectroscopy. Increasing of Pd content in the FeCoNiPdx samples only slightly influenced the Mössbauer spectra. They were analysed assuming simultaneous presence of hyperfine field and quadrupole splitting distributions, however random direction of observation relative to Bhf and EFG caused the average QS value to be close to zero. Increasing of Cr content in the CrxFeCoNiPd samples resulted in strong decrease of the hyperfine field, its distribution becomes wide and influence of Bhf,ISBhf and EFG on the Mössbauer spectra can not be separated unambiguously. The decomposing of the HEAs compositions into binary artificial Fe-dopant systems, namely [FeCoNi]-Pd and [FeCoNiPd]-Cr, allowed to interpret the magnetic structure of the two investigated series.
