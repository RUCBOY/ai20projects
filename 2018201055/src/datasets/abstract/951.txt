Inductive and capacitive sensors generate a dispersed electromagnetic field in their proximity. When a specific object enters this field the sensor impedance is changed. Thus, this object can be detected without the need for any physical contact. Unfortunately, vehicles with engines usually generate strong electromagnetic interference (EMI). Road traffic detection carried out with inductive-loop (IL) sensors is widely used. This paper validates a system for conducting simultaneous, multi-frequency impedance measurements (MFIM) of the slim IL sensor along with a smart application to a robust moving vehicle axle-to-axle distance measurement. For each operating frequency the MFIM system outputs impedance signals consisting of the real part and the imaginary part of the IL sensor impedance. Simultaneous operation at several frequencies increases information reliability and allows to monitor axle-to-axle distance in spite of artifacts, in the acquired signals, caused by even adverse EMIs generated by a vehicle engine. The MFIM system consists of an analog part including a current-to-voltage converter, and a digital part built on an industrial National Instrument PXI computer equipped with a card utilizing analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters with FPGA access. Based on conducted research, the MFIM system was set to simultaneously operate at 6 kHz, 10 kHz and 14.2 kHz. The bandwidth of the MFIM system was set in the range from 0 to 20 Hz what corresponds to the assumed speed of measured vehicles below 50 km/h. The results obtained in laboratory tests confirmed that the information included in impedance signals is correctly transferred in this bandwidth. Field measurements confirmed applicability of the simultaneous MFIM system for moving vehicle axle-to-axle distance measurement with increased EMI immunity.
