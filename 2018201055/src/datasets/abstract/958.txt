To solve the problem of unreasonable boundary conditions of the existing smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) non-Newtonian fluid simulation, a simulation system for collisions and two-way coupling of non-Newtonian fluids and solids is proposed to alleviate the loss of physical properties of simulated non-Newtonian fluid. In this paper, solids are sampled as single-layer boundary particles, and the corresponding density calculation formula is given. Fluid particles are interacting directly with the boundary particles under our interaction force calculation formula. The velocity of fluid particles near the boundary is iteratively updated using Coulomb friction boundary conditions. This method can be integrated into the existing SPH non-Newtonian fluid simulation system. Experiments show that the friction coefficient of the fluid–solid boundary can be adjusted according to the user’s experimental needs. Compared to simulation under free-slip boundary conditions, in our method non-Newtonian fluids can exhibit more diverse physical characteristics and have a good sense of reality effect.
