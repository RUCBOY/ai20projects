Linear regression-based and extended methods have been widely used in pattern classification. These methods can be roughly divided into two categories: reconstruction error-based methods and discriminative methods. The reconstruction error-based methods search the target label by learning the representation coefficients to compute the minimal reconstruction error. The goal of the discriminative methods is to learn the projection matrix to predict the target label of the image. To combine the advantages of these two kinds of regression-based methods, this paper presents a dual robust regression framework (DualRR) for pattern classification. In the training stage, a double low-rank robust regression model (DLR) is proposed to learn the projection matrix. In DLR, low-rank robust regression motivates us to model the data as the sum of a low-rank clean data and sparse noise matrix. The low-rank is further used to constrain the projection matrix to enhance the discriminative performance. In the testing stage, the proposed framework employs a robust regression representation model to learn the optimal representation coefficients and obtain the reconstruction sample to approximate the test sample. We thus apply the reconstruction sample to search the classification label by using the projection matrix learned in the training stage. Extensive experiments are conducted on six public available databases, namely, LFW, FRGC, CUHK Sketch, PolyU Palm, NUST-RF and Caltech 101, demonstrating the merits of the proposed model over state-of-the-art regression-based classification methods.
