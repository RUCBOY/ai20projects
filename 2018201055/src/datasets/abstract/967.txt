Parameterized matching has proven to be an efficient and useful tool for detecting code duplications. This paper presents a technique for calculating parameterized Longest Common Prefix (plcp) in constant time based on the knowledge about the plcp of the following suffixes. Using this technique, online p-suffix tree construction can be done in worst case time O(log⁡n) per input symbol. Searching for a pattern of length m in the resulting suffix tree takes O(min⁡{mlog⁡(|Σ|+|Π|),m+log⁡n}+mτΠ+tocc) time, where tocc is the number of occurrences of the pattern, and τΠ depends on Π. For constant-sized Π, τΠ=1, for polynomial-sized Π, τΠ=log⁡log⁡|Π|, and for unbounded Π, τΠ=log⁡|Π|.
