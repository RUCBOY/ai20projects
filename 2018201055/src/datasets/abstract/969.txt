In this paper, an image steganography method is proposed to overcome the limitations associated with the most existing image steganography methods based on either spatial domain or transform domain. Although these methods try to increase the embedding capacity, the produced quality of the stego-images is still low and the embedding capacity is still limited by the size of cover image. To address this problem, an image steganography method based on dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) is presented to increase the capacity and to keep the quality at its highest possible value. Also considering human visual system which is less sensitive to the edges, more secret bits can be hidden in the coefficients associated with edge pixels. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method in terms of capacity and image fidelity compared to the existing steganographic methods. Moreover, the proposed method is robust against universal analysis.
