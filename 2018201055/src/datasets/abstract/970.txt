An on-line chain partitioning algorithm receives the elements of a poset one at a time, and when an element is received, irrevocably assigns it to one of the chains. In this paper, we present an on-line algorithm that partitions posets of width w into wO(loglogw) chains. This improves over previously best known algorithms using wO(logw) chains by Bosek and Krawczyk and by Bosek, Kierstead, Krawczyk, Matecki, and Smith. Our algorithm runs in wO(w)n time, where w is the width and n is the size of a presented poset.
