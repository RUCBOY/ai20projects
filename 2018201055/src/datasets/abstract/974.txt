The progressed thermal features of nanoparticles in presence of Lorentz force, chemical reaction and activation energy utilizes novel applications various engineering and industrial processes, thermal engineering and medical sciences. On this end, current continuation aims to address the temperature dependent viscosity and variable thermal consequences in order to inspect the bioconvection aspects in non-Newtonian nanofluid over periodically moving surface. The rheological consequences for non-Newtonian fluid are addressed by using Walter's B liquid. The activation energy effects are also tested to improve the concentration of nano-materials more effectively. The Brownian motion and thermophoretic diffusion significances are incorporated explicitly with alliance of Buongiorno's mathematical model. Although some studies are already reported for nanofluid with constant viscosity but consideration of temperature dependent viscosity for bioconvection of non-Newtonian nanoparticles still need to be attention. Unlike typical contributions, here the flow is originated by periodically accelerated configuration. The appropriate variables enable to develop the non-dimensional for which the employed analytical simulations are carried out via homotopic procedure. The flow parameters are physically inspected with applications of various curves. The numerical iterative values are compiled for local Nusselt number, local motile density number and local Sherwood expressions. The results reveal that a reduced velocity profile is augmented to be the viscosity parameter. The assumption of variable thermal conductivity and temperature dependent viscosity are more effective for enrichment of nanoparticles temperature. It is also concluded that the microorganism for nanofluid increases for buoyancy ratio constant and bioconvection Rayleigh number.
