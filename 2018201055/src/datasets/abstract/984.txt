Temporal action localization has been a hot topic in video analyzation. In this paper, we propose a novel method called deep snippet selective network (DSSN) to address two key problems in weak supervision for temporal action localization, which are separability and integrality. Specifically, we employ two erasing branches to ensure the integrality, which can force the network to select other complementary snippets by erasing the most discriminative snippets. It is worth mentioning that a ternary mask is utilized to provide erasing branches with a background prior to enhance the separability of the model. Besides, we design a background suppression branch to further reduce the effect of background snippets. Extensive experiments on dataset THUMOSâ€™14 and ActivityNet show the effectiveness of our method.
