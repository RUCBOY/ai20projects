Human-machine interface plays an extremely important role in the diversified interactions between humans and machines especially in the era of the internet of things (IoT), by enabling information exchange between human and machine operations. Considering the high wearable compatibility and self-powered capability, triboelectric based interfaces have attracted increasing attention. However, most of them have the disadvantages of complex structures, large number of sensing elements/electrodes, and limited detection capability of the applied multi-parameter interaction. Herein, we present a minimalist and self-powered interacting patch based on the complementary integration of the triboelectric and piezoelectric sensing mechanism, achieving the simultaneous detection of multi-parameter sensory information of finger operations, i.e., contact position, sliding trace, and applied pressure. The 2D position and trace information in the xâ€“y plane is detected by the triboelectric unit with only four electrodes, while the contact force (z-direction information) is detected by the integrated piezoelectric unit. Benefited by this multi-parameter sensing capability, the interacting patch is successfully demonstrated as a writing pad, a 2D virtual car control, and a 3D virtual drone control interface, indicating its high adaptability in various human-machine interactions. Moreover, the proposed interacting patch is also verified with good performance in scavenging energy from human tapping. These results imply that the minimalist and self-powered interacting patch possesses high applicability and immediate practicality in various human-machine interactions, e.g., energy harvesting, writing pad, auto-control, robotics, virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearable electronics, etc.
