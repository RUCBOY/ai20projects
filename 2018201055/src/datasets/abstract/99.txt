Marbling score (MS) is related to beef auction price (AP) in Korea, but how these relate to marbling texture (i.e. number and distribution of marbling particles [MPs]) is not known. We examined relationships among carcass traits, carcass AP, and image analysis marbling texture traits. In experiment 1, carcass data and longissimus thoracis (LT) were obtained from Korean cattle steers reared under similar feeding conditions. MS, quality grade (QG), and AP were related (P < 0.001) to numbers of coarse MPs and fine MPs and fineness index. In experiment 2, LT images photographed at a slaughterhouse were used in regression analysis within individual QG classes (QGs: 1 [middle], 1+, and 1++ [best]). AP was related (P < 0.001) to numbers of coarse MPs and fine MPs and fineness index in both QGs 1+ and 1++ but not in QG 1. Overall, several marbling texture traits were related to AP, but both MS and QG were more strongly related to AP.
