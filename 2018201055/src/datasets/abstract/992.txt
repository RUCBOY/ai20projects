Increasing capital assets in the high-tech sectors impact numbers on average annual employment, reports, technology imports and economic growth standards. Analyzing the impact of Innovation and standardization in high technology assesses the impact of these factors on the elongation that occurs in traditional products. Technological advances, reports, technical imports are expressed in terms of quality 52%. The number of reports on the impact of growth on the high technology sector is unusually large. Using the three levels, the regional innovation system in the publishing area of ​​the data output technology, economy publishing stage play, and social benefits publishing is a role model for innovation activities and to evaluate technological efficiency. Using the envelope analysis method model proposes to economic performance and social efficiency of innovation activities in each regional innovation system and policy proposals. Most economic Innovation is the key driver of economic growth. Economic stagnation is suggestive attitudes reflect these policy responses have reduced the economic dynamism and lower living standards. Technological advances in many countries, GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth, and contribute. Machine learning (ML) with clusters of independent FPGA configuration for processing an application platform, has proposed a budget. FPGA configuration without the knowledge of researchers and developers, not looking for a budget-friendly solution to the most expensive on the market without relying on today's FPGA configuration to maximize applications' performance on their ML Focus on providing an economical platform solution.
