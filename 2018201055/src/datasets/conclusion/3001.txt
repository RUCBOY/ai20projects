We developed a content-based journal and conference recommender system for computer science and technology. As far as we know, there is no similar recommender system or published method like what we have introduced here. Moreover, there was no dataset to use. Therefore, we first designed a web crawler to collect data and generate training and testing data sets. Then, we used different feature selection methods and performed several experiments to select a good strategy and reconstruct feature space. Finally, using a softmax regression model, the system shows a three class-recommendation solution to help user find out the candidate journal or conference.
In this paper, the proposed recommendation method is used for recommending computer science publications. It is worth mentioning that only abstract of a paper is used to recommend. The method could also be used by other e-library recommender systems[8]. For example, the results of the recommendation could be used to help readers to quickly determine the domain of a paper or to retrieve similar papers. The method could be also used in e-business applications. For example, a business userâ€™s preferences can be summarized as a text (like abstract of a paper) and some recommendations, such as the engaged business area, could be generated using our proposed method based on the text. These recommendations facilitate the decision process of a business user (e.g., buyer) in selecting qualified business partners (e.g., sellers)[18].
Although achieving 61.37% accuracy for paper recommendation, we believe that the accuracy and F-measure can be further improved, which will be our future work.
