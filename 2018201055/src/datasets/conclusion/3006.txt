There is a growing market demand for healthcare simulation programs and likewise, the use of healthcare simulation technology. Currently, a significant technological knowledge barrier interferes with maximizing the utility of this educational tool by healthcare professionals. This barrier stems from a shortage of engineering professionals with specific training in simulation to team with healthcare professionals. A strategy to address this barrier is to educationally prepare engineering students to provide this dedicated technological support with an understanding of medical terminology implemented in the varied healthcare education programs across the country. The evidence presented in this article indicates that engineering students possess the interest, education, and drive to become interdisciplinary partners in simulation based education. Thus, it is logical to predict that the near future will see a rise in inter-professionals with a multidisciplinary simulation-based education.
