This article is about the numerical study of SLBQR computer virus epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we used three numerical methods for SLBQR computer virus epidemic model and observes that classical numerical methods fail to preserve positivity property and do not converge to both equilibrium states of the model at each time step. While proposed NSFD scheme is positivity preserving and unconditionally convergent to both steady states of the model. Convergence of the proposed NSFD scheme is discussed with the help of Jacobian matrix at both equilibrium points of the model. Stability of the SLBQR system is also verified with the help of Routh-Hurwitz conditions. Moreover, the bifurcation value of infection coefficient in SLBQR system is evaluated with the help of Routh-Hurwitz criteria.
