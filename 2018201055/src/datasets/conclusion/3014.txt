Many decades of research have established that collaboration is an essential component of learning. For computer science in particular, collaborative practices are central to the practice and learning of the discipline. In a study of fifth grade students pair programming in a computer science elective, we have examined talk time, “driving” time, consecutive dialogue moves, contributions of ideas, and other types of dialogue moves. We have seen that pairs vary tremendously in their balance of talk and control, and that depending upon their approaches to the challenges they face, they often achieve varying degrees of success. Strategies for self-advocacy and question-asking may be particularly important for the success of collaborative dialogues for computer science, as are strategies for succeeding in the face of contrasting levels of prior experience among partners.
These findings shed light on the pair programming process with young students and highlight important questions for the research community to address. The collaborative process for young students is highly complex, and this article has only examined a few of its dimensions. In addition to examining students’ speech and driving patterns, it is important for future work to conduct detailed task analysis of concepts and problems used in code, as well as how students decompose tasks. Additionally, rich nonverbal communication occurs in these collaborations, and we must examine it through modalities such as physical gestures, eye gaze, and facial expression.
By gaining insight into the collaborative practices of young students, we can identify strategies that are most beneficial to them, and work towards scaffolding that helps children achieve their full potential in collaborative learning.
