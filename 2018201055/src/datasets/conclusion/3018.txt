In this paper we have presented a sample GPU implementation of a classical D&C algorithm, Quickhull, by strongly utilizing those efficient parallel primitives provided by the library Thrust. Our sample GPU implementation is based on Tzeng and Owens's generic paradigm for parallelizing D&C algorithms on the GPU. The experimental results have demonstrated the practicality of our sample GPU implementation. We hope that our sample GPU implementation could be helpful for interested readers to develop their own efficient GPU implementations of D&C algorithms with fewer efforts and in less time.
