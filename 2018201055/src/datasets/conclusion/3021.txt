This paper contributes to our understanding of the relationship between the design of introductory programming environments and the programming practices they engender. Using a detailed vignette and data from a five-week study, we show how modality affects novice programmersâ€™ emerging programming practices. In doing so, we develop the notion of modality as a means for describing the relationship between an interface and learner and highlight modality as one possible design dimension that can be used to support novices in having early programming successes. This work is intended to complement other work focused on conceptual learning and attitudinal and engagement outcomes and help us think through the relationship between design and learning, specifically as it related to programming. Given the increased role of computer science and the growing number of introductory environments being developed and used in classrooms, having a complete picture of how these design choices impact novices is essential. The ultimate goal of this line of inquiry is that it will help shape the next generation of introductory computer science learning environments, and in doing so, shape the next generation of computationally literate students.
