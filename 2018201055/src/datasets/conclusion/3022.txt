This study is situated in the landscape of research on CBI, within which a number of studies focus on the effectiveness of CBI (e.g, Chauhan, 2017; Kulik & Kulik, 1991) and on the factors that influence the implementation of CBI, such as teacher self-efficacy (e.g., Tran et al., 2012) and school-level variables (e.g., Niemiec & Walberg, 1987). To our knowledge, this is the first published study to instead report on the influence CBI may have on the educational context, specifically the time available and use of that time for instruction. We found that our sample of teachers differed widely in their reporting of ST Math's influence on other subjects' instructional minutes. Although the limited information we found regarding recommendations and past practices suggested that time would come from either math instruction or general computer lab time, teachers were no more likely to report reducing math or computer instruction as they were to report reducing time for science and social studies. This was true even in fifth grade, where science is a tested subject on state accountability exams. Teachers' likelihood of taking from math time did not vary by grade-level; however, reports of reallocating time from ELA did: fourth and fifth grade teachers were less likely to take instructional minutes from ELA to implement ST Math. It should be noted that these teachers reported less time spent on ELA overall, and this may have influenced their protection of this time. That teachers did not appear to consistently take time from math implies that they are not necessarily adapting ST Math as a blended learning model, and instead are adding additional pressures to their weekly curriculum. Understanding both the occurrence of time reallocation and the root of teacher decisions about such reallocations can help us understand the ecology of CBI implementation and its reach beyond the students and their screens.
