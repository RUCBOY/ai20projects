EXFOR is the major nuclear physics database for low- and intermediate-energy nuclear reactions. The database and its Web interface are publicly available through the IAEA, (http://www-nds.iaea.org/exfor), BNL, (http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/exfor), and mirror websites. The Web interfaces provide transparent and easy access to nuclear reaction and associated bibliographic information with direct links to the original data sets and articles, where possible. Recent application developments include many features for nuclear scientists and engineers, such as user-friendly data uploads, data renormalization, covariance matrix, and inverse reaction calculations. The authors will continue to address the applied and fundamental science user needs by developing new data access, processing, dissemination, and analysis capabilities.
Further implementation of the advanced analysis features and integration with ENDF and NSR databases improves database completeness, extends EXFOR scope, and ensures the high quality of its contents. A complementary Google Scholar citation data analysis shows a broad impact of the current interface on nuclear energy and physics research worldwide. The EXFOR database and its Web interface represent a robust system that has evolved over the last fifteen years into a premier nuclear reaction data portal. This system is based on the latest computer technologies and is well-positioned to satisfy current and future nuclear science and technology needs and challenges.
