In the current paper, we have found that passive UHF–RFID is a viable wireless technology for many BCI applications. This technology can support stable transmissions for at least a hundred electrodes in the depths and configurations we have measured. We studied the impact of tissue fluid, blood viscosity and implant depth on signal transmission (e.g. ECoG signals) using multiple UHF passive RFID transmitters. Also we present comparative study between single, two and three transmitters at different implant depth. Our study is the first step in modeling multiple channels for BCI applications. We specifically studied system parameters, which are imperative for the design of any wireless communication system. These were received signal strength, channel capacity, path loss, maximum number of electrodes, power delay and frequency response for varying implant depths from 1 cm to 4 cm. These results have been showcased in tables and graphical representation for varying implant depth. We find that passive UHF–RFID do not work accurately when implant depth of the transmitter is greater than 3 cm. Using multiple transmitters can improve the bandwidth transmission even though the transmission data rate could be reduced. Furthermore, implantable chips should be ultra-low power devices to avoid any deleterious effects of high power on the neural tissue within the cranium and on the spinal cord. In conclusion, the appropriate requirements for WBAN sensor devices are small, lightweight and low maintenance. These devices are achieved by using a promising communication technology which is backscatter RFID in the UHF range. Backscatter sensor tags have low power consumption and thus make it suitable for WBAN systems.
