In terms of use, TOC needs to allocate data bits and reconstruct the optical processor. But the interaction between the user and the TOC is weak. In order to expand the application of the TOC, this paper proposes a computing-data model. When using TOC in this model, the user does not need to understand the details about the software and hardware implementation of the TOC. It is only necessary to give the required parameters for the calculation. After the SZG file is sent to the TOC, the TOC can automatically solve the userâ€™s problem without human intervention. The author also explains the model file and designs the implementation process of the computing-data model in detail. Finally, through a specific application, it is verified that the idea is correct and the method is feasible, and the computing-data model is convenient for users to use TOC.
