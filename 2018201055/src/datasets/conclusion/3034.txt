This article presents a study on a computer-aided approach for debris disk candidate search that leverages data from several astronomical databases and crowd-sourcing results. The case study presented here employs crowd-sourcing data from NASA’s Disk Detective project to train machine learning algorithms and achieve scalability on a larger data set, providing predictions of debris disk candidates from the list of all planet–host stars. Furthermore, the algorithmic approach also facilitates the easy creation of ranking lists with debris disk candidates, which can help human scientists query candidates with different properties and assess potential probabilities for detections in follow-up studies. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to combine crowd sourcing and machine learning for debris disk search in infrared bands in the presented way.
With upcoming missions such as the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), as well as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the astronomical data volume will inevitably lead to a stronger need for automation. The case study presented in this work demonstrate that this hybrid approach has the potential to provide target candidates for these missions as well as to support astronomical discoveries from future data. Lastly, as more data is being collected and validated, better training sets for machine learning and additional human classification records are going to increase the fidelity of the approach presented in this paper.
