Digital data collection is an important activity for many organizations in the developing world. We focused on ODK as a widespread digital data collection platform and conduct a computer security threat modeling exercise to evaluate attacks that could target ODK deployments. We conducted a survey and interviews with organizations using ODK to understand what threat models are considered in the field. Leveraging our threat model, survey, and interview results, we explore the challenges of computer security in digital data collection in an ICTD context and make recommendations to organizations seeking to keep their data secure.
