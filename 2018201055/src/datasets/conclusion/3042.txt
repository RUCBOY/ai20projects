Thus, the model of interaction between learning and evolution has been analyzed both analytically and by means of computer simulation. Analytical results have been obtained for the infinite population size. The population size in computer simulations has been chosen sufficiently large.
Our main results are the following.
1.If the population size in computer simulations is sufficiently large, then the essential results of simulation do not change at further increase of the size. In our computer simulation, such large population size was n = 10,000. The genotype and phenotype length was N = 100.2.At sufficiently large population size, the main results of computer simulations coincide with the analytical results.3.The computer simulations demonstrated that the main mechanisms of the interaction between learning and evolution (the genetic assimilation, the hiding effect, the influence of the learning load on the interaction between learning and evolution) were observed at considered large population size. These mechanisms are similar to the mechanisms investigated in the previous work (Red’ko, 2017).4.The hiding effect was investigated in detail both by means of computer simulations and analytically. The dependence of the hiding effect on efficiency of leaning load was analyzed. In particular, the dependence of the average Hamming distance between the genotypes in the final steady state and the optimal chain on efficiency of leaning load was obtained (Fig. 6).
