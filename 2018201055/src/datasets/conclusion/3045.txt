The flow experience structure in the context of computer-game-playing behavior was different from the original theory's structure and could be divided into cognitive flow and emotional flow. In particular, if a player had a cognitive flow experience to evaluate, analyze, plan, set a goal, and become aware of self-improvement, he/she would be more likely to have a positive outcome. On the contrary, if a player had emotional flow experience causing contentment, intense concentration, and low consciousness, it could cause psychological and physical impacts. Gender and the type of game were relevant to the duration. Males and online games tended to consume more time. The duration of game playing could affect the recognition of mental and physical consequences. Nonetheless, the key factor of positive and negative behavioral outcomes was identified using the flow experience of a game player.
From this study, organizations related to children and adolescents' affairs, science and technology, software industry promotion, education, and public health should encourage children to play a game in a positive way. Moreover, there should be support to develop games that can yield advantages to computer game playing and to organizing a competition in a game that was beneficial or in game-development competitions. Future research could consider a comparison between samples who were diagnostically addicted to games and game players who played on a daily basis regarding how similar or different their antecedents of flow experiences were. This study could be applied in other contexts for social benefit, such as flow experience in work, flow experience in playing sport, or flow experience in playing music.
