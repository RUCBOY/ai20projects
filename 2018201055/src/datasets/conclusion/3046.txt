Considering the potential advantages of optical computing in the applications that require a large amount of computation and suit for implementation in parallel computing because of its super low energy consumption and huge information capacity, DFT/FFT is studied as a typical application. Combined the advantages of optical computing as well as DFT/FFT, two implementation methods are presented. And, the realization and characteristics of the two schemes are also discussed. Based on the current state of TOC, a typical optical computer, partial parallel method is discussed in detail. The results with extensive experiments show that methods proposed are correct and reasonable. Full utilization of the advantages of optical computing, TOC has great potential advantages and broad prospects in the applications similar to DFT/FFT that need a lot of computation and can be implemented in parallel.
