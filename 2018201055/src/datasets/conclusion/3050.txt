In summary, calibration of immunoreactivity intensities by pathologists, following computerized H-score measurements, has the potential to improve reproducibility and homogeneity of biomarker detection regarding epitope validation in multicenter studies. Such computerized measurements are able to deliver adequate data in the low expression range and to confirm pathologists’ scorings regarding correlations with clinicopathologic parameters, including survival.
