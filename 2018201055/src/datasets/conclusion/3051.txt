We provide new evidence on whether computers and the skills acquired in using them have effects on earnings, employment and college enrollment by performing a field experiment in which community college students were randomly given computers to use at home and were followed for 7 years after treatment. Restricted-access administrative data on earnings were obtained from the California State Employment Development Department (EDD) UI system records and matched to all study participants. These data allow us to study employment and earnings among covered wage/salary jobs in the state (i.e. non-federal and non-military). We do not find evidence of treatment effects (either positive or negative) on earnings. We also do not find evidence of effects on the extensive or intensive margins of labor supply. The findings of null effects are consistent across many different specifications, measures, and subgroups. One caveat, however is that although the results consistently show null effects the estimates are not precise.
Using matched restricted-access administrative data on college enrollment from the California Community College system and National Student Clearinghouse, we also do not find that computers and the skills acquired in using them increase college enrollment. This is important not only because it contributes to estimates of the effects of computers on educational outcomes, but because it suggests that the null effects of computer skills on earnings do not appear to be due to increased college enrollment. We do not find evidence of treatment effects on college enrollment in the short or medium run, and controlling for ``endogenous'' college enrollment in the earnings and employment regressions has little effect on the treatment effect estimates.
Importantly, our null effect estimates from the random experiment differ substantially from those found from an analysis of CPS data, raising concerns about the potential for selection bias in non-experimental estimates of returns. Estimates from regressions with detailed controls, nearest-neighbor models, and propensity score models all indicate large, positive, and statistically significant relationships between computer ownership and earnings and employment, in sharp contrast to the null effects of our experiment. It may be that non-experimental estimates overstate the labor market returns to computer skills.Table A.1.

Our focus in this study was on the labor market returns to computer skills among community college students. Of course, the returns to computer skills may differ for other groups, but community college students are an interesting group in their own right. They represent roughly half of all public college students in the United States and a much larger share in some states, such as California. Community colleges provide training for a wide range of jobs of which a large percentage require the use of computers at work (e.g. Table A.1). Among workers with community college degrees, 85% use a computer at work (OECD 2012).23 On the other hand, community college students may have more limited computer skills than do four-year university students because they have less exposure to computer labs on campus and rarely have the opportunity to live on campus.24 We might expect the labor market returns to computer skills to be higher when those skills are more limited in supply. Thus, the finding of a null effect for community college students, among whom we might expect larger effects, provides a useful test of the hypothesis. The null effects might be due to employers training workers with the technology skills required for jobs, or other skills acquired in community colleges as being much more important for employment. Alternatively, we cannot rule out the possibility that the experiment failed to detect an effect because it is difficult to perfectly alter the computer skills of workers.25
Still, the labor market effects of computer skills likely differ across groups and the experimental results presented here make one contribution to this body of evidence. More experimental research is needed using different groups, especially from different parts of the educational distribution.
