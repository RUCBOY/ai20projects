The authors establish a cognitive reliability model based on Bayesian network to analyze human reliability in cognitive process. The following conclusions are obtained by analyzing experimental data: (1) p(c) referred as prior probability is obtained; (2) CPT of p(f2|f1j, f3j) is obtained; (3) obtain each corresponding value with jth level of ith influencing factor for Î´ij; (4) the basic cognitive error probabilities of each level of each influencing factor are obtained; (5) The cognitive error probabilities in HTS leak accident obtained; (6) the model has good sensitivity, accuracy and convergence by analyzing experimental data.
The model will provide an analysis method for cognition reliability. But, the model also has some shortcomings, for instance, the involved cognitive influencing factors in the paper possible exists unilateralism, the experimental process performed is not in a real main control room of a Npp, but in a quiet room. In future work, we will further select some important influencing factors, experimental data will be obtained by a real simulative main control room of a Npp to further improve the correctness of parameters for Eq. (5).
