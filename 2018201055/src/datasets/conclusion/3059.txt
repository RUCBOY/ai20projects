According to the complexity of designing digital and computer systems based on the parallelism, this research proposed a novel idea to simplify the designing work by proposing novel logic gates symbols called “Peer-Logic-Gates“.
The proposed symbols of the “Peer-Logic-Gates“ have either two or three parameters. The new gate symbols that have two parameters (i & k) consider as 2-D logical models. They involve number of concurrent and similar gate type. They are capable to represent the needed logical operations of single vector of bits. Moreover, the new gate symbols that have three parameters (i & j & k) consider as 3-D logical gate models. They also include number of concurrent and similar gate type. They are capable to represent the demanded logical operations of matrix of bit-vectors.
We faced three challenges to accomplish this work. Firstly, this paper introduced a terminology for novel 3-D matrix type denoted by “Bit-Vector-Matrix“. Secondly, the standard Boolean algebraic expressions are reformulated based on the new matrix “Bit-Vector-Matrix”. Thirdly, the reformulated Boolean expressions are constructed as logical circuits in peer-to-peer modules rely on the deterministic algorithm. The prepared modules (considered as functional units in digital system) built using the proposed symbols of the 3-D Peer-gates. The digital designers can use the Peer-gates symbols to simplify the intensive parallel operations (2D and 3D) in their hardware systems.
Furthermore, the instructors can utilize the Peer-gates symbols to simplify the teaching of many hardware courses (like Logic design and computer architecture) by new symbols as models.
