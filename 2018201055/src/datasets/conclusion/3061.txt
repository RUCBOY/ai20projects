Overall, our results indicate that the mean scores for self-report surveys completed using paper-and-pencil or the computer are generally comparable. These findings can be affected by the presence of others. Additionally, when conducting research on this topic, within-subjects designs are less likely to have systemic characteristics leading to heterogeneity across study effect sizes. Consequently, those interested in gathering data need to take these factors into account when designing studies. Finally, our study demonstrated the use of the recommended equivalence testing procedure that has recently been gaining traction in the paper-and-pencil and computer comparison literature (e.g., Eckford & Barnett, 2016; Lewis et al., 2009; Weigold et al., 2013; Weigold et al., 2016) in meta-analyses.
Building on a body of literature spanning hundreds of independent samples, a clearer picture regarding the mean score comparability of paper-and-pencil- and computer-collected self-report survey data is emerging. Our results offer evidence of the general comparability of paper-and-pencil and computer data collection methods, with some caveats concerning specific procedures. These findings are promising for both self-report data collection via computers and the use of equivalence testing in meta-analyses.
