The projectile functions of the four neutron induced reaction channels of 235U (n, 2n)234U, 235U(n,3n)233U, 235U(n,γ)236U, 235U(n, f) on uranium isotope were discussed. The reaction cross-section functions for the taken reaction channels have been studied in the energy range of (1–100 MeV).
The experimental data were compared with those calculated values using the computer code COMPLET. The theoretical and experimental results of the total cross sections of the neutron induced fission reaction on 235U as the function of the projectile energy were comparable for all the channels considered in this study and were strongly correlated.
