There is an increasing amount of surveillance video data available from railroads that provide opportunities for near-miss-driven safety analysis. This paper presents an AI-aided computer vision technique that is able to automatically identify and collect data regarding near-miss events due to unsafe trespassing of highway-rail grade crossings. This grade-crossing detection algorithm is capable of processing video data in a reasonably short period of time with adequate accuracy in the real-world scenario. Moreover, the near-miss detection can efficiently work under various weather and visibility conditions. The automated collection of near-miss data supported by the AI technology in this paper can be used for the development of a grade-crossing near-miss database and provide opportunities to study and improve grade-crossing safety. The near-miss database can be used for behavioral risk analysis and the development of risk-informed studies, to prevent the occurrence of risk-prone behaviors and resultant accidents. Ultimately, an interdisciplinary safety study between psychology, statistics, and railway engineering can contribute to insightful risk reduction strategies and significantly improved the safety at highway-rail grade crossings.
