In this article, the MEM for computer viruses is investigated with Caputo- Fabrizio derivative and extends to the scope of calculus pertaining to fractional order. The fixed-point theorem is used to prove the existence and uniqueness of a system of solution. By applying an iterative perturbation scheme the special solution is obtained for the fractional order model. To represent the effect of fractional order some numerical simulation are performed. By simulation it is clear that when œÅ tends to 1 the Caputo-Fabrizio derivative demonstrates more interesting behavior. Thus, it can be concluded that the newly fractional derivative is very useful for modeling the real word problems.
