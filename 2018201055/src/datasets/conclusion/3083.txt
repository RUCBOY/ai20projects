In this paper, the Optic Nerve Head (ONH) detection algorithm discussed in [37] was implemented as an app running on Android smartphones. This algorithm uses Radon Transform (RT) to detect the ONH in retinal fundus images with high accuracy in the presence of high brightness and color variations in such images, in particular when captured by smartphones. The optimization steps taken allow this algorithm to run efficiently on Android smartphones. The experimental results based on four fundus image databases have shown the effectiveness of the developed app in terms of both the ONH detection accuracy and the execution time of the app. The developed ONH detection system provides a mobile and cost-effective Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system in ophthalmology which can be deployed in areas where the use of expensive ophthalmology equipment poses a challenge.
