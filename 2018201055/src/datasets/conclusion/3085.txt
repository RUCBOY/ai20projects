AF is an irregular and often fast heart rhythm that may lead to serious health problems. Early detection of AF will avert further progression, and with appropriate preventive treatment, reduce the likelihood of patients developing stroke and other heart-related complications. Therefore, it is vital to attend to screening for AF effectively and efficiently. This review paper provided a comprehensive overview of existing CADx systems designed to aid cardiologists in their diagnoses of AF. The CADx system has additional benefits over the manual examination of ECG signals. The diagnosis is quick and reliable. Moreover, deep learning is discussed in this study. The integration of deep learning algorithms into CADx systems has been shown to boost the performance for classification. The diagnostic accuracies of the CADx systems can be made optimum with a greater number of sample ECG data available to train the system. Moreover, with the web-based system implemented, the diagnosis can be made anywhere. Hence, the system will be more robust, and possesses the capability to be deployed in clinics and hospitals, even in remote locations, for reliable and real-time diagnosis of AF.
