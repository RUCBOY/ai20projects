In this study, we documented and predicted topic changes in CBM. On a technical level, that was done by analysing author supplied keywords in all CBM publications from 1990 to 2017. The analysis was structured into two distinct parts. The first part was cluster analysis and the second part focused on tracking the keywords over time. The cluster analysis revealed the depth and breadth of topics covered in CBM. Tracking keywords over time resulted in 40 graphs that document the normalized yearly keyword appearance in percent. A large value of the accumulated gradients provides strong evidence for the diversity of CBM topics.
Our bibliometric analysis can help the CBM readership and the wider research community to plan their research. We found that SVM, EEG and IMAGE PROCESSING are very well established topics in. In the discussion section, we put forward some research gaps and highlight deep learning as an up and coming decision making algorithm. We recognise that computers in biology and medicine will continue to be an engine for progress and indeed change. That change will be gradual and linear, similar to the gradual demise of ANN and the steady rise of SVM. We do not anticipate any sudden and unexpected events from using mature computing machinery. Such sudden and unexpected events can occur as a reaction to new wide spread diseases and, to a lesser extent, in reaction to new data acquisition methods. The outcomes of our analysis can help the CBM editors to maintain the journal as a relevant forum to exchange ideas on the latest trends for computing machinery in biology and medicine. We recommend embracing new ideas and not shying away from complex methods, because they are the agents of change. Fast and sound reviews will improve the reputation with authors. Frequent guest editions can also help to explore new topics or vitalize dormant areas.
