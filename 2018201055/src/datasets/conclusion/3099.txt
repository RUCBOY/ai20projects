In this paper we show the behaviour of Cache Bytes system counter. Results of the experiment were related to the proposed, analytical model, which was able to catch the important process features in terms of Tsallis statistics, system performance and the existence of power-laws. It turned-out that possible non-Gaussian behaviour of analysed counter Cache Bytes can have elegant analytical description. The amount of available cache memory in computer systems is limited — the existence of power-laws in cache may suggest that some technological limitations are broken, but Gupta and Campanha proposal allowed for simple explanations of these doubts. The above presented equations show how the classical theory of queues, which in the simplest approach operates on mean values, can be expanded toward non-extensive formalism.
Our paper was based on one case thus there is a need to do further researches in order to develop this approach. First of all, a better analytical methods, which allow estimation of model parameters (parameters α, β, θ and i), are necessary — now it is done basing on linear fit of data in log–log plots and Levenberg–Marquardt (L–M) algorithm. Second, there is a need to carry more experiments related to other computer systems configurations that can confirm or deny obtained results. It seems that they can be more common (even ubiquitous), but computer systems of general purpose are not the only one that use cache memory. Remembering that the management of cache memory is an important task of the operating system, obtained results can wide our knowledge about processes that exist during human–machine interaction and necessary actions that should be done in order to guarantee acceptable system performance.
