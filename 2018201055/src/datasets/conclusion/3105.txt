This article provides a further demonstration of what qualitative research can bring to RCTs and their recruitment [38], [39], [40]. By examining the detail of what was said in actual consultations, we have been able to turn an empirical lens on concepts that to date have primarily been based on theoretical interpretations or post hoc analysis of the reported data. The way recruiters in these RCTs commonly tended to describe randomisation was often detrimental to patient recruitment and informed consent. There is clear evidence that recruiters should avoid problematic gambling metaphors and illusions of agency in their explanations and instead focus on clearer descriptions of the rationale and method of randomisation to enable patients to better understand this crucial part of the recruitment and informed consent process.
