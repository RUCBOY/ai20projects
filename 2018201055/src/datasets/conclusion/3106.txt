An X-ray parabolic cylinder laterally graded multilayer reflector is designed and fabricated to collimate a divergent beam emitted from Cu kα source for X-ray diffraction. The experimental device is made of a Cu kα X-ray tube, a slit, a reflector, an X-ray CCD camera, and position stages.
To achieve excellent collimation performance, the computer-aided assembly process for the assembly of the X-ray parabolic cylinder laterally graded multilayer reflector to collimate divergent beam, is used to quantitatively guide the adjustment.
Firstly, a high efficiency setup for collimating the divergent beam from the X-ray tube and evaluating the parallelism of the collimation beam is proposed.
Secondly, the performance of the reflector used in the experiment is simulated according to the size of the source, the surface topography of the parabolic cylinder reflector substrate and the period thickness distribution of the laterally graded multilayer coating on the reflector. The divergent angle was determined to be approximately 0.003 deg.
Then, the adjustment is performed by analyzing every essential adjustment step and quantitatively computing the resetting value, including the z-axis of the reflector and the z-axis of the X-ray tube, the z-axis of the X-ray reflector and the z-axis of the CCD camera, the propagation director of the collimated beam and the x-axis of the CCD camera, the grazing angle and the reflector–source distance.
Finally, the reflector is effectively assembled with a divergent angle smaller than 0.004 deg. With this small divergence, it is possible to measure layer thicknesses of less than 500 nm and only broadens the reflection widths by 0.008 deg. Moreover, the intensity distribution is very similar to the uniform theoretical intensity distribution.
