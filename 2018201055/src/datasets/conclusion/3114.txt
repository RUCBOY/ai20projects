BCI established a bridge between behavioural and clinical theories. The advent of this may returned a new look in the field of learning to human and computer for the cognitive state classification that reflects the functioning a human brain with its unique capacities for symbolic transformation and organisation into an electrical signal (motor imagery). On the other hand, soft computing has a collection of methodologies that helps to exploit above cognitive state classification into definite prediction. This paper includes a supervised learning algorithm using FFBPNN for motor imagery classification. The paper concludes with following:
•This paper proposes a FFBPNN based motor imagery classification scheme.•Highest accuracy of the method is up to 99.8%.
