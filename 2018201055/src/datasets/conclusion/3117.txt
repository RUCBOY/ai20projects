The most commonly reported symptomatic areas were the neck and shoulder, followed by lower and upper back. Participants reporting poor seated postures (e.g. leaning forward, or sitting on the front edge of the chair) had increased odds of experiencing discomfort in the upper back. Few administrative staff and even fewer academics had attended Workstation Ergonomics Training or had requested individualised ergonomic assessments and these were not associated with having discomfort. These findings indicate that musculoskeletal discomfort is prevalent in workers in the university setting and this is associated with working postures. The high uptake of health services for musculoskeletal discomfort indicates a reliance on treatment, rather than prevention. The lack of Workstation Ergonomics Training and workstation assessment reported by university staff, coupled with the associations between ergonomics and discomfort, suggests that implementation of ergonomic interventions may be one strategy to address musculoskeletal discomfort in workers in university settings.
