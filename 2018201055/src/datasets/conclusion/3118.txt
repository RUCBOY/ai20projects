In this work, a survey on pedestrian detection and tracking system have been presented. Recent adoption of Deep Learning methodologies and in particular of Convolutional Neural Networks for pedestrian detection and tracking deserved a dedicated state-of-the-art survey. The analysed works highlight the need to investigate how modern approaches to pedestrian detection work and a comparison with the features-based approaches on benchmark datasets has to be done.
However, the reported works show encouraging results in automatic pedestrian detection, but further architectures need to be implemented and tested. In particular, for pedestrian detection, the most successful way seems to consist in the combination of Deep Learning with classical Machine Learning models because this seems to imply high levels of accuracy and less computation respect to hand-designed features and classification. Moreover, it will be interesting to compare the performance to this task of optimal ANNs topologies with SVM.
