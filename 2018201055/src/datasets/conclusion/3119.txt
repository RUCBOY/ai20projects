We implemented a novel method for classification of clinically significant prostate cancer lesions from MRI images using sparse autoencoder and random forest classifier. The use of ADASYN, SMOTE and Weka-Resample to solve the class imbalance problem associated with the dataset are investigated. We were able to classify PCa into clinically significant and indolent with an AUC of 0.979 and accuracy of 93.6538% and kappa score of 0.873 in a resampled dataset. Our experiments show that features extracted using sparse autoencoder can effectively be used for distinguishing clinically significant PCa in a resampled dataset. Our experiments also show the effectiveness of ADASYN over SMOTE and Weka-Resample in solving the class-imbalance problem. Our future plan includes developing a fully-automated computer-aided system for the diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer.
