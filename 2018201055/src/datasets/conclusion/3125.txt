A computer-aided and robust design algorithm for highly efficient metasurface-assisted Fabry-Perot cavity resonators was proposed which can be repeated for any FPCA with any directivity level and any type of metasurface-based PRS layers. The presented design algorithm is general, based on the ECM, and can predict the performances of FPCAs whose lateral sides are covered with PEC walls. In addition, it eliminates the time-consuming trial-and-error steps usually appeared in the conventional design techniques. As the prototype of the proposed design method, a high gain antenna exhibiting an extremely high aperture efficiency was designed and analyzed for wireless applications. Considering the theoretical formulation of the cavity and the modified equivalent circuit of PRS, a hybrid optimization was applied to extract the unknown geometric parameters of PRS. The final structure was tested, achieving 18.6 dBi directivity, 17.2 dBi realized-gain, 126% aperture efficiency and 3.1% usable bandwidth. According to the metallic lateral sides of antenna, a desired front-to-back ratio of 30.5 dB and 27.2 dB was attained in the E- and H-planes, respectively. Therefore, the presented metasurface-assisted cavity is an appealing candidate for several wireless communication systems, such as point-to-point links, base station cellular systems, and satellite systems.
