A new approach is proposed to detect individual workers who do not wear their harnesses while working at heights on construction sites. Two algorithms were developed: (1) a Faster-R-CNN to detect the presence of workers; and (2) CNN models to identify the harness attached to workers. The results that were achieved demonstrated that by combining the CNNs that a high degree of accuracy could be achieved in detecting workers that were not wearing their harness.
The precision and recall rates for the Faster R-CNN were 99% and 95%, respectively. Similarly, in case of the CNNs the precision and recall rates were marginally lower being 80% and 98%, respectively. It was revealed that the Faster R-CNN provided a better detection accuracy to detect people and the CNN models for the harness. The Faster R-CNN framework enabled the deep models to focus on annotating a worker. In addition, by mapping the feature map and sharing with the RPN and FRCN computation time was reduced. This enabled the extracted feature of the RPN to be directly connected to ROI pooling layer ensuring the CNN to quickly detect the worker.
Despite not being able to recognize the harness with 100% accuracy, the developed deep CNN approach can provide site management with several benefits to their everyday practice. Firstly, safety behavior can be monitored without disturbing people while they working. And secondly, a wide range of working areas can be simulteanously monitored, which can reduce the costs and time associated with inspections. Having a real-time monitoring system in place to monitor people working at heights provides a mechanism to reduce falls and improve safety.
