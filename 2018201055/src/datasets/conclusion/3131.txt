Modern methods of simulating developments in the real world and its visualization using immersive systems of virtual reality represent a prospective direction of scientific development and the popularization of scientific results to the public. Many scientific and practical disciplines are equipped with trainers for training conducted activities. The realization of thinning is an area of practical and scientific activity in forestry, which deserves attention in the field of trainer development. Such trainers should be linked to an efficient simulation tool of forest development, should contain forest visualization using virtual reality, and should use hardware for the immersive visualization of virtual reality. Despite a great number of applications for immersive visualization from different areas of science, research, education and practice, we could not find any references for an existing forest thinning trainer in available publications and internet sources that would meet our requirements. The design solution of our CAVE system is an innovative device in European conditions, regardless of its usage. From the perspective of its application as a thinning trainer and the technical link of individual components, the system is unique at a global scale. We proposed a solution that connects a forest-growth model with a forest visualization solution and modern hardware of the CAVE type. It is a fully automated system with frugal maintenance. In addition, it has an open architecture, which allows the improvement of individual components and the addition of new functionalities. It is a practical tool that can support decision-making in forests and landscape and forestry education. Our solution can become the basis for similar devices applied in forestry and ecology.
