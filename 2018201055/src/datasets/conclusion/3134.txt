Through the incorporation of AB computer software, the RSM statistical method and compromised MOO technique, the proposed approach for product design was developed herein. With the presented approach, the optimal product parameters can be found for the best ergonomic fit between users and products. Additionally, with the statistical method in the presented approach, the importance rankings can be identified as reference for product design improvement. Because of statistical optimization and randomized users' sizes with upper level muscle activities constrained, the discovered product parameter values are robust to the variation of usersâ€™ size under the tolerable risk of possible injuries. Owing to the computer musculoskeletal model, the product design can also be completed in the least time and cost at the earliest stage of development. In addition, users can select their most suitable fit of product via computer musculoskeletal modeling in real time instead of the conventional questionnaire for suitable product selection.
