The ground-based measurements display a marked difference in the position of the polarization maximum for the high-albedo (αmax ≈ 72°) and moderate-albedo (αmax ≈ 110°) asteroids. To study this phenomenon the theoretical approach was used. This approach show that the position of positive linear polarization maximum αmax depends on imaginary part of refractive index. Moreover, the modifying the T-matrix method (so-called Sh-matrices method) was carried out too. The computer modeling was performed for an ensemble of random Gaussian particles. The real parts of the refractive index mr were 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 while the imaginary part of refractive index varied from mi = 0.0 to mi = 0.5. It was found that the imaginary part of refractive index exert specific influence on the position αmax and polarization maximum Pmax. For small mi that corresponding of the high-albedo E-type asteroids, the value of αmax is much smaller than that for large mi, corresponding to the moderate - albedo S-type asteroids. In this way, the theoretical approach and modeling showed the qualitative agreement with the observed effect in asteroids.
