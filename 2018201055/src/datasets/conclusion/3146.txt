From the present study we can make two conclusions:
➢The first one concerns the used atomistic model. This model of the three-dimensional film growth can be used for the further studies in thin film physics.➢The second one concerns the used image analysis algorithms. While the standard morphological techniques describe well the homogeneous structures with low secondary nucleation, these algorithms cannot be used for the analysis of highly non-uniform systems. New class of morphological algorithms based on different principles must be suggested for the description of these systems.
