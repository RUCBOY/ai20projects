Mammography has played a key role in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. CBIR-based mammographic approaches could provide more clinical evidence to assist the diagnosis. However, lack of the spatial configurations of features suffers from visual word ambiguity and quantization error, and thus sets a limit on their retrieval precision as well as diagnostic accuracy.
In this paper, we introduce the geometric verification method in mammographic mass retrieval. By capturing the spatial configurations of matched features in mammograms, we grasp the local similarity characteristic of deformations in the local regions by constructing the circle regions of corresponding pairs. Meanwhile, we quarter the circle to express the geometric relationship of local matches in the area and strictly generate the spatial encoding. Additionally, we rotate the quartered circle to control the strictness of geometric constraints. Finally, we verify geometric consistency to filter the false matches. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset including 2400 mass ROIs and 9217 CAD-generated false positive ROIs. Excellent results demonstrate the retrieval precision of our method.
Local features are vital for mammographic masses retrieval. The gradient information used in a SIFT descriptor may not have as much information as the intensity values in mammograms. In our future work, we will study a new region constraint method in which local regions are characterized by multiple descriptors instead of a single descriptor. Hopefully, it will be helpful in increasing the retrieval performance.
