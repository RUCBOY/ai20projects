The current research has presented a low-cost, non-destructive and rapid way based on the fusion of dielectric spectroscopy and computer vision for analysis and evaluation of quality characteristics of virgin olive oil during storage. CFS algorithm was implemented on the extracted dielectric and colour features to reduce the dimension of the input vector and enhance the speed of models. The useful data in different techniques of machine learning were used to perform modelling for storage time classification and quality indices prediction. Performance evaluation of the classifiers indicated that the BNs technique was the best classifier with an accuracy of 100% for all types of learning methods. To nondestructively predict quality indices of VOO, several machine learning techniques were performed including ANN, SVM and MLR. Almost all types of developed models showed good prediction ability. Among predictive models, the SVM with RBF kernel function had the best results (R = 0.969, 0.988 and 0.976) for prediction of PV, K232 and chlorophyll, respectively. Also, the SVM with normalized polynomial kernel had the best results (R = 0.989, 0.976, 0.969 and 0.969) for prediction of AV, TOTOX, K268 and carotenoid, respectively. The ANN with 40-2-1 topology gave the best result (R = 0.977) for modelling FA. The machine learning techniques which have adequate performance and needs lower processing time can be selected as the best model for online applications. So, to speed up the characterization process of olive oil in an automatic system, MLR technique due to having a good potential in modelling can be used with little error tolerance compared to applied artificial intelligence techniques. Thus, this fusion system can be employed to verify if olive oil quality standards still satisfy the required standard thresholds for being commercialized as high-value VOO.
