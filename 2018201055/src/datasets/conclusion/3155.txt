In this work, a numerical investigation on the thermal behaviour and subsequent heat transfer augmentation of cylindrical micro-fins with artificial surface roughness is studied using Chebychev spectral collocation method. The numerical solutions of the developed thermal models are used to carry out parametric study and to establish the thermal performance of the rough fin over the existing smooth fin. The results show that the geometric ratio and surface roughness of the micro-fin enhances its thermal performance. The study also establishes that the fin efficiency ratio is always greater than unity when the rough and the smooth fins are subjected to the same operational condition with the same geometrical, physical, thermal and material properties. The findings of this study are timely for the fabrication and miniaturization of heat sinks with rough surface area for electronic/computer systems. A key advantage of miniaturised heat sink with fan size is the reduction on the airflow rate and control of acoustic level, which results in lower distortion and subsequently increases the lifespan of any electronic or computer component.
