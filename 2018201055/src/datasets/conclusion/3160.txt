The computer simulation study showed that the decline in coherent clones of LESCs observed in ageing mouse eyes could be explained by LESC replacement leading to stochastic neutral drift without reducing absolute LESC numbers. This shows that stochastic neutral clonal drift of LESCs could be a feature of normal homeostasis of the mouse corneal epithelium. We do not exclude the possibility of progressive LESC loss or inactivation. All three mechanisms may be acting and their relative contribution to corneal epithelial maintenance in the adult mouse deserves further investigation.
