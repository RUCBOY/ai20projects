The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of an automated method for the planning of agents' color appearance based on the multi-objective IGA; in addition, an automated tool was developed. Designers are able to easily and quickly create the desired color appearance with the tool. That it, the generated appearance can evoke the desired personality impression, express designer preference, and be harmonious in terms of color. The advantages of our method are that it requires little expertise for designers and lowers the barrier for designers; in addition, it can help designers speed up the design process and reduce their workload. However, our study has some limitations which need to be improved in future. For example, more design elements such as texture should be considered and be integrated into the tool; the automated color planning method of three-dimensional agents will also studied in the next step.
