An original computer program was set up to design and control olive paste malaxation under exposure to air, based on the empirical kinetic models of Trapani et al. (2017a) and Trapani et al. (2017b). The program appeared applicable in several hypothetical malaxation treatments under exposure to air.
Several optimal time-temperature conditions were predicted as a function of different olive fruit oil contents and different optimal thresholds. An apparent high oil yield with a minimum degradation of oil phenolic compounds could occur both at a low temperature (i.e. 22 °C) with times between approx. 40–60 min and at a high temperature (i.e. 35–37 °C) with times between approx. 30–50 min.
The malaxation treatments at a low temperature appeared preferable, since they seemed to be unaffected by time-temperature profiles under unsteady-state conditions; this statement is in accordance with the literature data (Kalua et al., 2006; Gomez-Rico et al., 2009; Taticchi et al., 2013). However, it seemed more difficult to identify optimal time-temperature conditions at a low temperature than at a high temperature in the following operating states. When we hypothetically worked at the lowest level (i.e. 20%) of olive paste oil content tested in this paper, only a low level of apparent extraction yield (i.e. approx. 60%) was congruent with a low level of phenolic degradation in the oil. Then, the degree of ripeness of the olive fruits seemed to play a critical role (Artajo et al., 2007; Trapani et. al., 2016). When we hypothetically worked to reach the highest possible apparent oil extraction yield value in combination with a low value of oil phenolic degradation, the maximum extraction yield value was approx. 90% with an approx. 10% relative degradation of 3,4 DHPEA at 24% of olive paste oil content.
