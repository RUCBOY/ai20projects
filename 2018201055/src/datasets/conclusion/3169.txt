In this paper, we have proposed a computer-aided diagnosis system for cavernomas based on axial T2W MRI images. The proposed system first extracts the brain region using an atlas-based skull stripping method. A template matching method is then used to detect the candidate cavernoma regions. Several texture, HOG, and LBP features are extracted for each candidate, and feature dimensionality is reduced using PCA. Finally, five SVM models are used to classify the candidate regions into cavernoma or non-cavernoma. Experimental results show a promising performance of the proposed technique. The future study will be focused on the segmentation of cavernous malformations using high-resolution 3D MRI images and the evaluation of the system with a larger dataset.
