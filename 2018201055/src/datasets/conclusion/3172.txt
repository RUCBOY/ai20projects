Scientific Gateways have become a handy tool to support researchers regarding experiment execution, data storage, and dissemination of results. However, in many cases systems show limitations, such as low processing capacity, storage space and response time. Such problems configure capacity bottlenecks, which compromise the efficiency of the systems.
Based on Galaxy experiments, we evaluated the retrieved information and extracted a general model from the data by using different regression techniques. We have proposed a decision module for improving the flexibility of execution environments and offering a smooth transition between multiple environments. The solution can also adapt to independent user's investment capabilities and avoid waste of resources. The module and its unique machine learning application is the differential component of infrastructure that supports current environments.
The SVR model showed high accuracy in predicting the proper machine to execute the workflow based on user's parameters definition and a good estimation of the processing time. A varied environment can be the best solution, once it includes cloud computing and offers other types of machines.
As future work, we intend to model an architecture on WorkflowSim for a complete view of the science gateway capacity, considering the whole network, connections and modules involved. Decision Maker is on the core of the architecture, towards aiding the definition of the best machine capacity to scientific experiments.
