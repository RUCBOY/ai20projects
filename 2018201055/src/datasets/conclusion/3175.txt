The study presented a human-in-the-loop method based on self-developed nasal airflow monitor and image processing to physically and objectively assess the increase in breathing resistances of wearing respirators. While the results are encouraging, additional research is needed to further develop the method. Future research should explore the relationships between this one and the other more human-in-the-loop measuring methods of breathing resistances.
