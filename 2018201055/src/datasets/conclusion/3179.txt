This study developed an SD model for characterizing computer recycling behavior in Taiwan. The proposed SD model was verified and three dynamic hypotheses were validated by the recycling data collected by Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA). With the MA forecast method, the proposed SD model was employed to predict future recycling quantities. For model qualification, the proposed SD model presented an average FEP over the four recycling groups around 2%. This result indicates that the model is able to capture the dynamic complexity of the long-term recycling system and appropriately characterize the recycling behavior.
The computer recycling behavior in Taiwan was investigated by considering the technological, socio-economic and behavioral factors by means of three dynamic hypotheses. To be more specific, recycling refunds or rebates, holding duration, and the advent of innovative technology were proven to have a significant impact on the recycling behavior of obsolete computers. This study proved the proposed SD model to be a promising tool capable of systematically analyzing computer recycling behavior. However, the analysis in the present study was obtained using data collected for computer-related behavior under current recycling policies. The obtained results were found to be helpful for governing authorities in providing an insight into recycling behavior. Feasible recycling policies based on the dynamic hypotheses can be appropriately proposed. Moreover, the recycling behavior analysis should be re-conducted using the same SD methodology if the government recycling policies or technology advancement changes significantly.
