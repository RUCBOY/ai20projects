We implemented a novel method for classification of prostate cancer grade groups from MRI images using texture features and stacked sparse autoencoder. We were able to classify PCa into different grade groups moderately. The performance that we achieved with the limited dataset should be improved before the framework is applied to clinical use. However, being one of the pioneer methods which attempted to classify 3D volumetric prostate cancer lesions into 5 grade groups from MRI images, this can be used as a base method for further investigations and improvements. Our future work includes incorporating more mpMRI modalities and techniques to solve class imbalance problem for further improvement in diagnostic accuracy.
