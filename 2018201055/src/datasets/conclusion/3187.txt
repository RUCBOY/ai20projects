In this study, the purpose is proposed for diagnosing the breast tumors on the 3-D elastography by using the B-mode and the elastographic feature sets. Firstly, the proposed segmentation methods are used to extract the tumor contour and mask for the B-mode images. Then, to analyze the tumor lesions, two feature sets containing B-mode and elastographic features are extracted by using the tumor contour and mask. Finally, the B-mode, elastography, and combined feature sets are used to classify the tumors separately. From the experimental results, the combination of shape, ellipsoid fitting and elastographic features has the best performance. According to the experimental results, the tumor morphology, texture, the best fit ellipsoid, and the elasticity information of tumor help the system diagnose the tumors more precisely. In the preprocessing of proposed segmentation method, the parameters of sigmoid filter are selected according to experience to get a more precise tumor contour. However, different parameters selected by different people will cause a dissimilar segmented tumor contour and also a dissimilar diagnosis performance. Hence, an automatic segmentation method that not only sets the parameters automatically according to the image contrast and quality but also further improve the diagnosis performance is expected to be developed.
