In this study, to reconstruct the temperature distribution, the additional assumption was used that the temperature variations must satisfy the heat equation. That assumption made it possible to reduce the dimensionality of the problem solved which, in turn, led to a decreased uncertainty in the temperature reconstruction. A similar approach can be adapted to the reconstruction of the temperature distribution within the human body with an error acceptable for medical purposes (0.5–1 K).
