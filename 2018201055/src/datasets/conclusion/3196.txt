In summary, efficient and selective molecularly imprinted magnetic HNTs was developed by a simple surface imprinting method using firstly flexible docking in computer simulation. In addition, response surface methodology as a second powerful QbD approach in the design of experiments and data processing was successfully applied in adsorption behavior study to gain the complete information in loading process and reduce the experimental time. The MHNTs-MIPs prepared from MAA exhibit excellent adsorption capacity and specific recognition toward NOR in serum and water samples. Furthermore, it can be collected and separated easily from the supernatant by an external magnetic. MHNTs-MIPs used as sorbent of SPE makes the pretreatment of samples faster and more effective without extra centrifugation and filtration. In addition, the regeneration of the polymers is considered satisfactory. The presented MHNTs-MIPs combined with HPLC-UV for determination of NOR in serum and lake water samples provides a promising substitute to traditional SPE and can be widely used in preconcentration and determination of analytes in complex samples.
