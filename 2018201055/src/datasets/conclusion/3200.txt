The paper presented NetsBlox, a web- and cloud-based visual programming environment that enables users to create distributed applications. NetsBlox extends the well-known and widely used Snap! environment, and hence, it provides a natural progression to students who take the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) class. Consequently, novel curricular units can be easily incorporated into BJC, one of the new AP CS Principles coursesÂ [3]. NetsBlox is an ideal vehicle to support some of the big ideas and computational thinking practices that are emphasized in the AP CS Principles curriculum, including the Internet, communication, collaboration, cybersecurity and global impact. NetsBlox also supports collaborative editing from multiple computers, allowing students to work together on shared projects from their own computers.
Furthermore, providing access to vast arrays of data on the Internet directly in the visual programming environment will empower the students to create innovative science projects and simultaneously bring STEM concepts into CS education. The ability to create multi-player games will provide increased motivation for a large number of students and encourage them to be creators and not just consumers of digital entertainment.
