In this paper, we adopted qualitative analysis of pearl powder originated from three different grades of pearls and quantitative analysis of adulterated pearl powder. Color information of diverse pearl powder samples were obtained rapidly and accurately by computer vision technology, so as to provide more information for qualitative identification of pearl powder collected from different sources and make exact source traceability.
For different grades of pearl powder and the shell powder all having highly similar chemical profile (IR spectral profile), SD-IR and 2DCOS-IR have been applied to enhance the spectral resolution to distinguish them convincingly. It has been demonstrated that the Tri-step infrared spectroscopy could be a promising tool for quality evaluation and authenticity identification in a more objective, simpler and timesaving manner.
Based upon the IR macro-fingerprints, the three pearl powders originated from different quality grades of pearls or the pearl powder adulterated with different proportion of shell powder, could be identified and distinguished straightforward. More importantly, computer vision technology and Tri-step infrared spectroscopy with enhancing resolution coupled with chemometrics (PCA and PLS) were established for better traceability, quality grade discrimination and quality evaluation of pearl powder and could provide scientific classification basis and reference for establishing pearl powder quality grading standard protocols and thus regulating and enhancing pearl powder production.
