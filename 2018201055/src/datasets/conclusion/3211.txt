Since anthropogenic GHG emissions are blamed for the global warming and climate change, CCU technologies have received much attention as one of the bridge solutions while the transition to renewable energy can fully take place. For screening promising CCU technologies among numerous candidates, evaluating such technologies at a process level is very important. However, the evaluation should be done in multiple aspects (economics & lifecycle CO2 emission and reduction) so that multiple metrics should be calculated.
For the fast and efficient definition of process options and calculation of the metrics, the computer-aided analysis tool, ArKa-TAC3, is developed. The tool adopts the concept of the superstructure network for the selective analysis of processing paths, and it guides users with well-organized steps for inserting input data. Based on the entered data as well as those in its own database, the tool also calculates the evaluation metrics on economics and CO2 lifecycle emission reduction of CCU technologies.
Finally, ArKa-TAC3 is flexible to accommodate additional functionalities and capable of analyzing various CCU technologies as it adopts a generic model. As industrial sectors have growing demands for screening, analyzing, and evaluating CCU technologies fast and efficiently, we expect ArKa-TAC3 will attract their attention and grow in its functionality.
