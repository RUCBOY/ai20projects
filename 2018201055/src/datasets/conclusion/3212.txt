In the present study, involving 20 patients with ALS, the P300 speller BCI was effective. It may be considered a reliable input method allowing patients with ALS to communicate with their environment. Compared to previous studies, the key features of our system, such as word prediction and optimal stopping of flashes, allowed for significant gains in efficiency; hence, visual P300-based systems are a possible communication alternative for disabled patients, provided that some practical aspects of the EEG system setup are simplified to improve the satisfaction in use. Additional developments can be made at the hardware and software level, such as in the electrode detection and wire-free transmission of signals, to further enhance performance and usability.
