This work presents the performance of juniors, seniors, and graduate entry nursing students in an educational experiment aiming to exercise the students' diagnostic reasoning skills. Students achieved a similar performance despite their level within the nursing program. Besides that, factors such as demographic variables and exposure to the NANDA-I taxonomy seems not to contribute to variance in diagnostic accuracy. Our results also point to areas that need curricular improvement. Future research is needed to determine student's ability over time, as well as to examine the specific factors that contribute to diagnostic accuracy. Studies carried out in other nursing programs, that may be teaching diagnostic reasoning with NANDA-I, can be helpful to create strategies to enhance the diagnostic reasoning skills.
