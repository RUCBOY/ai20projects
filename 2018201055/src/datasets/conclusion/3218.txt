In this paper, an intelligent feeding decision method for fish was proposed. Using near infrared machine vision and an ANFIS model, automatic feeding control was realized according to the appetites of fish. The results indicate that the ANFIS model can achieve a feeding decision accuracy of 98%. Compared with the feeding table method, no significant difference in growth was noted (P > .05). However, the FCR can be reduced by 10.77%, and water pollution can be reduced. Further applications of the method in production can significantly improve economic efficiency and provide a theoretical foundation for the development of new intelligent feeding equipment or systems. However, this method requires additional validation in other fish species before it is used in commercial-scale fish farms.
