RNA secondary structure loops contains nested dependencies, so it cannot be represented by regular grammar or finite automata. Previous attempts to represent these sequences use context-sensitive grammar or stochastic context-free grammar or tree adjoining grammar, which have higher time complexities. In quantum automata theory, a two-way quantum finite automaton is more dominant than its classical counterparts. In this contribution, we focused on RNA secondary structure hairpin loop; internal loop and double helix loop and represented them by using two-way quantum finite automata. The major benefit of this approach is that sequences can be parsed in linear time by one-sided bounded error. To the best of authorâ€™s knowledge no such representation is done using two-way quantum finite automata so far. In the future, we will try to represent other secondary structure loops such as bulge loop and junctions using other quantum computational models.
