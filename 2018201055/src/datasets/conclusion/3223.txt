Despite the limitations of this in vitro study, the following conclusions could be drawn:
1.In the comparative evaluation according to the aging method between thermal cycling and autoclave aging, various physical properties were changed according to the aging method for each restoration material.2.Mechanical properties of CAD/CAM materials decreased after hydrothermal aging treatment and hybrid CAD/CAM restorative materials tend to be lower than those of conventional CAD/CAM ceramic materials before and after aging.3.Two hydrothermal aging treatment reveal various effects on materials, however, Vita Enamic in Young's modulus and CeraSmart in surface roughness showed no significant change even after aging procedure.4.When using hybrid CAD/CAM restorative materials, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of materials according to the clinical situation.5.Long-term clinical studies on changes in mechanical properties are expected to be needed to demonstrate good long-term prognosis in clinical applications of hybrid CAD/CAM restorations and it is needed to consider that the properties of restorative materials vary according to the each aging procedure.
