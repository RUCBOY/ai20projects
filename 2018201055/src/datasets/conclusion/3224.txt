The findings in this study show that it is possible to detect movements performed with different levels of speed. It was observed that the performance of the BCI was not affected by the training and no trend in signal morphology was observed. The BCI performance was not affected significantly when using different calibration paradigms. Interestingly, the performance was similar when calibrating the BCI on old data and on new data. This suggests that the MRCP-based BCI can be calibrated in a single session and used in subsequent sessions without a decline in performance; also, without the need for training the subjects. Future studies should include testing in the intended user group (stroke patients). Also, it should be investigated if the system calibration can be performed by experts and the system can be transferred to e.g. the home of the patients where stroke rehabilitation potentially can be performed.
