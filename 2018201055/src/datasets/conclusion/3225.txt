In this work, we proposed a novel approach for navigation with rejection option via computer vision. Our proposal employs topological map information to improve the localization and navigation tasks in mobile robots. The study was carried out on two sets of images from synthetic and real environment using the GoPro camera. Furthermore, we assessed our proposal against consolidated feature extractions and machine learning techniques. Then, we compared the same robot with a GoPro camera against an omnidirectional camera in the same environment to assess the robotâ€™s navigation capability.
The navigation test accuracy was 100% for Minimal Learning Machine-Nearest Neighbors with Spatial Moments and for Bayes classifier using the same feature extractor without the rejection option when GoPro camera is adopted, in other words, our approach confirmed the path obtained. However, with the omnidirectional camera, Minimal Learning Machine-Nearest Neighbors with Local Binary Pattern accuracy increased 11.6%, from 86% to 96%. Similarly, Bayesian classifier with Spatial Moments accuracy increased from 82% to 93%. Then, we can conclude that our approach increases the navigation efficiency and reliability in mobile robotics, and can be used for this purpose in real applications such as autonomous wheelchair navigation and for museum guided tours. Another important contribution is the two novel image databases creation. Both can be used in other works.
Future work will assess the proposed approach in another indoor and outdoor environments. In addition, changes in lighting conditions and visual aliasing can be studied. Furthermore, we will explore others types of vision sensor just like other feature extractors such as the Structural Co-occurrence Matrix and machine learning methods such as Optimum-Path Forest.
