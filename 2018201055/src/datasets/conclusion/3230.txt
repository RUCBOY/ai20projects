The combined imaging technique based on computer vision and laser-light backscattering parameters represents an innovative and reliable method for rapid and non-destructive monitoring of drying processes, specifically for inline measurement of the colour changes of sweet potato during industrial drying. This method responded to changes during drying based on different drying conditions. The optical parameters that were mostly affected by drying temperature were the blue colour (F-value = 16.64), surface area (F-value = 14.70), light intensity (F-value = 13.73), green colour (F-value = 12.33), and red colour (F-value = 10.75), respectively. Drying time also affected the blue colour (F-value = 14.95), surface area (F-value = 9.26), light intensity (F-value = 9.26), and illuminated area (F-value = 9.26). Validation and PCA classification results signified that the combined CV and backscattering imaging technology presented great promise in predicting and classifying the quality properties of sweet potato during different drying conditions. The classification result showed that the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) were able to adequately explain the total data variance by 87%. PC1 was able to explain 50% of the total data variance, while PC2 explained 37% of the total data set. The combined imaging parameters adequately predicted the moisture content, lightness, and redness of sweet potato during drying with R2 > 0.7. Overall, this quality inspection method could offer a strong basis for the current trends in non-destructive monitoring of the drying process of agricultural crops. The results obtained for sweet potato can also serve as a basis for other tropical tuber crops, and in other postharvest crop processing and plant disease detection. Nonetheless, further works relating to using more imaging parameters, wider range of drying conditions, and enhancing the accuracy of predictive model especially for moisture content are required.
