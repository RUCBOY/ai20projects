Thermal properties are a critical issue in lithium-ion batteries as they strongly influence battery performance and safety. Thus, for maximizing battery performance it is essential to properly analyze the effect of the thermal behavior of different battery geometries through computer simulations. This work shows the effect of the thermal conditions (isothermal, adiabatic, cold, regular and hot conditions) in different battery geometries, including conventional (layer by layer) and unconventional geometries (interdigitated, horseshoe, spiral, ring, antenna and gear geometries). The simulations were based on the Newman/Doyle/Fuller model with a coupled thermal model. Under isothermal and adiabatic conditions, the best geometries are interdigitated and gear geometries due to higher battery performance and low temperature values relatively to the other geometries and the main reason for this behavior is the smaller separator thickness, lower distances for the ions to move (d_max) and higher contact surface area of the electrodes.
The best battery performance is obtained for the gear geometry at cold condition (265.15â€¯K). For regular and hot thermal conditions the best geometries are the gear and interdigitated ones. The generated heat mostly depends on the internal resistance related to the maximum distances that ions move until its intercalation and on the thickness of the separator.
Thus, this work demonstrates how the battery performance can be optimized for specific geometries considering different thermal conditions. The results shown in this work are an essential step for the applicability of these geometries into specific applications, once they can be fabricated by 3D-printing techniques. Further, considering that the interdigitated geometry presents excellent cycling properties, it will be further interesting to evaluate the effect of the thermal properties considering different active materials for the cathode.
