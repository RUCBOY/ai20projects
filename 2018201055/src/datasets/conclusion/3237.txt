In this work, a computer diagnosis system to detect Hamartoma nodules from CT scan images is proposed. The features selected by ant colony optimization algorithm with cosine similarity and rough dependency measures are used to classify the nodules using NB and SVM classifiers. The selected features are also used with J48 decision tree classifier. From the results, it can be seen that SVM classifier yielded better results when rough dependency measure is used with ant colony optimization to select features. The performance of the classifier model can be improved further, if the segmentation algorithm is able to detect the nodules even at periphery.
