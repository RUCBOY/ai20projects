A primary contributor to ultrasound wave degradation is phase-interference created by variations in transit time of a propagating ultrasound wave. In this study, the implications of zero, partial and full spatial-temporal matching of ultrasound transit times was explored. It was demonstrated that only full spatial-temporal matching removes phase-interference. This paper also introduces the concept of a twin-layer ultrasound phase-interference compensator (TL-UPIC), the aim being to provide both spatial and temporal matching of ultrasound transit times. Since the concept was experimentally validated in solid acrylic step-wedge samples, future work should consider natural tissue samples.
