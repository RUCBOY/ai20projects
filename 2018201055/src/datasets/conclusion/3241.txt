The proposed model allows for the more accurate characterization of the differences between the prosody of L1 and Taiwan L2 English speech with a hierarchical account of global discourse factors as well as information structure, thereby incorporating interaction of multiple levels of interaction involved in overall continuous speech prosody. Experimental results revealed how Taiwan L2 speakers are less sensitive to different sized speech units and hence supported our motivation that discourse cohesion, information structure and their interaction were indeed the major contributors to Taiwan L2 English accent. Specific difficulties Taiwan L2 English speakers experience in producing fluent and expressive prosody was further accounted for by analysis and simulation of L1 prosody, where complex parallel planning strategies to achieve semantic association/cohesion and emphasize key information contents at the same time are involved. Our L1 prosodic model was used to resynthesize corrected L2 speech to simulate improved prosody for L2 learners with feedbacks that help increase both intelligibility and comprehensibility in terms of fluency and expressiveness. We hope that the proposed linguistic information-based prosody model could further enhance fluency, comprehensibility and expressiveness of L2 continuous speech and at the same time provide more linguistic implications for advanced computer-assisted language learning. Future research will focus on training the proposed model with more realistic speech data to improve its prediction accuracy, with particular attention to more refined parameters and adjustments at the discourse level, and its integration with existing TTS/CALL systems.
