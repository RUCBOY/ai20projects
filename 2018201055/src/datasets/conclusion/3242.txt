Computer simulation using movable cellular automaton method was performed to theoretically study the peculiarities of material flow in friction stir welding of duralumin plates. First, we studied the influence of the welding regimes on the material transfer and stir, as well as temperature fields in the welded joints in the 2D statement. The simulation results showed that for the considered model system the optimal values of the ratio of the rotational velocity to the welding speed Vrot/Vtrans ranged within the interval of 20â€“40, which provides sufficient material stir and transfer to form a welded joint with a minimum number of defects. The use of FSW regimes in the specified range allows avoiding significant overheating of the joining materials as well. Then the application of the additional ultrasonic impact to the rotating pin was analyzed. The simulations showed that additional ultrasonic vibrations of the special amplitude and frequency can reduce the weld porosity without the significant increase in the weld width.
Based on the 2D simulation results obtained, a 3D model of FSW using movable cellular automaton method is developed. The obtained 3D simulation results allow us to make the following conclusions: (i) the optimal ratio Vrot/Vtrans allows transporting of the welded material around the pin several times and producing the joint of high quality; (ii) using the pins of different shape (cylinder, cone, pyramid) without a shoulder results just in small scatter of displacements of the plasticized material in the workpiece thickness direction; (iii) applying additional ultrasonic vibration to the pin may lead to better stir of the welded material behind the pin.
