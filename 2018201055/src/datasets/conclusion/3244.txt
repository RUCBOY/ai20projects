Keeping in mind that in this survey paper we attempted to briefly report an analysis of indicative solutions that span across different research areas and cover quite diverse research directions by showing that most presented scenarios need efficient and effective context data distribution, the overall conclusion drawn may be summarized in the following quotation: when dealing with humanistic computing applications and systems, researchers should in principle initially target more flexible and rather generic approaches and then try to identify additional but inherent sources of meaningful information to boost and enhance their findings in a qualitative manner. Since contextual information is now widely accepted to have many forms and depictions, the era of extremely focused and domain-specific applications and systems is over.
By assimilating the herein briefly presented works and by providing a short discussion and interpretation for each identified context group, we believe and hope that the implemented categorization will be used by fellow researchers in the seek of future useful research directions. Our goal was to be able to utilize and exploit our current efforts as a future point of reference for the interested parties. Our future plans include the examination of contextual information in narrower, yet trending, application domains, like specific popular social networks (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, etc.) or even AI-enabled gaming, so as to be able to monitor evolving trends in context utilization and identify potential new emerging context models in the process.
Clearly, it is not possible to tackle all aspects of modern humanistic computing in a single paper nor discuss all contextual manifestations in the process; several open remaining issues are to be identified by the experienced reader. Still, if the final statement of this work would be to select the most significant one, we may identify a rather fruitful unexplored research area, i.e., the one of designing and developing self-adapting contextual mechanisms by dynamically combining contextual information at different processing levels. Of course, the main argument behind the lack of this type of solutions derives from the actual complexity of the problem, but we believe that modern humanistic computing is close enough to achieve such a milestone in contextual research in the near future.
