Software engineering students often have a strong technical background in CS subjects, but lack the knowledge and skills to enact group work projects in an entrepreneurial environment. In this paper, we retrospectively analysed seven years of educational projects with start-up-like traits and developed 16 educational patterns and 16 anti-patterns for enhancing software start-up instruction in higher education. The patterns and anti-patterns cover the physical and virtual environment, course design and placement in the curriculum, learning materials, and teacher guidance.
Besides the patterns, we discuss the prerequisites for software start-up education. A thorough reform of the curriculum may be needed to achieve the desired learning outcomes, and prepare students for a world where entrepreneurship may be a dominant form of employment. Future studies could address how software start-up education can help build students’ developer identities and enhance their self-efficacy beliefs, as well as examine how technical knowledge and skills should be considered in start-up education. Further extension and validation of the patterns and anti-patterns, as well as in-depth study on the customer’s learning and integration into university-led experiential, project-based education, are among the potential future directions in this area.
