Based on the experimental data and first principle calculations, a realistic long-range empirical interatomic potential was firstly constructed for the Ni-Hf-Mo system consisting of three different metals with bcc, fcc and hcp structures. Taking the constructed interatomic potential as the starting point, the atomic-level structure and its correlation with the shear deformation behaviors of Ni-Hf-Mo metallic glasses were investigated by atomic simulations and various analysis methods. Interestingly, the appropriate amount of Mo addition to Ni-Hf alloys could enhance the overshoot stress σover and the flow stress σflow, while reducing the plasticity of the alloy. By monitoring the atomic rearrangements during shear deformation process, local shear behaviours are closely related to the structural and mechanical response. The fraction evolutions of the distorted icosahedra change in a synchronized fashion with the observed stress-strain curve. In addition, the connectivity degree of the spatial network could have a considerable effect on the structure and performance of metallic glasses.
