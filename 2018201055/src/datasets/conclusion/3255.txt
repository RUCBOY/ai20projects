In conclusion, a dissipation module has been developed for the expression of the quantity and the transition of the output-function dissipation factor using the QCM. The system is compact and can be easily incorporated into any QCM system. The QCMD parameters are measured by the LabVIEW program with a real-time system, and the change curve is displayed. The measurement records the of QCMD, compared with the customary Quartz Crystal Microbalance, is that it in besides to measuring changes in frequency (∆f), a simultaneous parameter connected to the energy loss or dissipation (∆D) of the system is also measured, as well as the duration of the experiment and the current temperature. In this work, the duration is set to 1200 s to allow ample time for each QCM to achieve stable resonances before the measurements are recorded. The potential of this QCMD includes real-time conducting and point-of-care analyses for the detection of biological molecules. The corresponding platform will also be used to effectively develop the efficiency of a drug-screening process in the near future.
