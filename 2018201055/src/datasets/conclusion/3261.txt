In this paper, we have investigated several gray level texture analysis methods for the characterization of mammogram ROIs. The proposed methods include gray level co-occurrence matrix, fractal analysis, Hilbert’s image representation, Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance and maximum sub-region descriptors. By extracting features directly from the entire ROIs, we not only escape the challenging problem of mammographic mass segmentation, but we also take into account the texture surrounding the lesion, which is useful for breast cancer diagnosis [18]. A feature selection step was also included to choose the optimal feature set. Several classifiers (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree) were considered to distinguish normal tissues from masses. Empirical evaluation in a large database composed of challenging suspicious regions extracted from the DDSM database prove the efficiency of the suggested method for false-positive reduction in mammographic mass detection. Our future work will be devoted to the combination of our feature set with multi-resolution curvelet moments, which provide better accuracy than our proposed gray level feature set. Furthermore, we plan to consider deep learning for comparison in our future work. Another future direction is to test the proposed framework in the case of current digital full breast mammographic images.
