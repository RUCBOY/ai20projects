To summarize, we provide here the combined biophysical approach to study the helix-helix interactions in TM domains of membrane proteins in various lipid environments. The technique is based on the ability of bicelles to form particles with the size, depending on the lipid/detergent ratio. To implement the approach, we provide the experimental parameters of “ideal bicelle” models for four kinds of zwitterionic phospholipids, which can also be used in other structural studies. We show that the size of bicelles and type of the rim-forming detergent do not affect substantially the spatial structure and stability of the model TM dimer. On the other hand, the effect of the bilayer thickness on the free energy of the dimer is dramatic, while the protein structure is unchanged in various lipids with fatty chains having a length from 12 to 18 carbon atoms. The results of MD simulations and free energy calculations are consistent with the experiment. The obtained data is analyzed from the viewpoint of hydrophobic mismatch and lipophobic effects and reveals the complex character of the free energy of helix-helix interaction dependence on the parameters of the environment. This hinders the straightforward prediction of the bilayer contents influence on the helix-helix interaction mode and free energy.
