This study will help individual institutions to establish an action level for agreement between primary calculations and independent dose calculation for IMRT and VMAT. A local dose difference of ±5% at a point within the PTV (above −350 HU) may be a reasonable action level for IMRT and VMAT, although differences in verification programs would affect the trends in the dose difference. Thus, care is needed for MLC modeling for DLG and transmission factors. We may choose whether the MLC modeling is optimized for IMRT or VMAT, similar to the TPS. In particular, the MLC modeling would affect the calculation accuracy more for SW IMRT and H&N. Inter-institutional comparisons showed that plan variations affect the dose deviations in SW IMRT and that VMAT is more robust than SW IMRT.
