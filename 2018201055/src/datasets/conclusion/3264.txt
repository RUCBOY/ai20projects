Individualised home-based one-to-one training is effective in developing social media skills for youth with disabilities. Advancing social media skills holds promise as a way of deepening and extending the social networks of such youth, who typically have reduced social networks compared to their peers without disabilities. Internet and social media skills can also help overcome some of the limitations of geographical isolation and may support education and employment opportunities as youth transition into adulthood, particularly for those living in rural areas. Despite the limitations of this study, the findings provide insight into the benefits of assistive technologies in reducing barriers to communication online, and the importance of social media training to empower youth with disabilities to more effectively engage with their peers online through social media sites. The study has also identified several areas of research that could extend the sectorâ€™s understanding of the facilitators and barriers to social media use, and the strategies that can be employed to address identified barriers.
