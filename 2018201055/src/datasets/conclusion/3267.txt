This paper has presented a computerised tool for the automatic quantification of renal interstitial fibrosis in digital biopsy images. The proposed approach is based on the identification and segmentation of all commonly seen tissue structures in renal biopsies in order to achieve a more accurate calculation of the amount of interstitial fibrosis structures in the biopsies. Upon evaluation against the ground truth dataset, the system achieved an average error of within nine percentage points and an average pixel accuracy of 78%. Experiments testing the effectiveness of the system as a diagnostic aide to the pathologists have revealed a rise in correlation between different pathologists by as much as one category of agreement in the kappa test, proving the capability of the system as a reference standard in interstitial fibrosis quantification. In a clinical setting, the automated quantification of interstitial fibrosis will help to reduce the inter-observer variability between practising pathologists. Thus, this contributes to a more objective estimation of the amount of fibrosis in renal biopsy tissues.
