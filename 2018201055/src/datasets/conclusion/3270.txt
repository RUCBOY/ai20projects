A computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) and process simulation study is performed to identify practically attractive ILs for n-hexane-methylcyclopentane extractive distillation. The high reliability of the employed UNIFAC-IL model for predicting the thermodynamic properties of this system is validated by a large number of experimental γ∞ and VLE data. Based on the UNIFAC-IL model, a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated and solved for the CAMD of ILs. The top solutions of the MINLP-CAMD problem, i.e., the designed IL candidates, are further introduced to Aspen Plus for process simulation. These ILs all present notably higher process performances than NMP, and [C9Im][SCN] is consequently identified as the optimal entrainer for n-hexane-methylcyclopentane extractive distillation. This work could also offer very helpful guidance to the selection of IL entrainers for separating other alkane-cycloalkane close-boiling mixtures.
