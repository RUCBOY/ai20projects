Due to technical and economic limitations in developing countries, simultaneous improvement of HCWM system is not often possible in all hospitals and a step-wise manner seems more desirable to managers. Thus, it is reasonable to conduct a comprehensive assessment on the current conditions in all hospitals of a city and determine the cases with the worst conditions in order to locate them at the priority of optimization and improvement. This is while hospital managers or health experts deal with a huge raw data from checklists with difficulty in reporting, interpretation, and documentation.
This research presented an ontology-based multi-criteria decision-making support framework for data optimization and problem solving of conceptual data in hospitals through developing a quantitative index. In the presented HCWM index fuzzy modeling was coupled with data mining to overcome uncertainties that have flown from big data environment of hospitals’ event logs along with stakeholders’ opinions. This index was found to represent the CEP and CPM of process mining types for assessing a hospital’s performance in the waste management ward. This index as a process modeling tool could detect the hospitals having weakness in HCWM that need improvement and rank them satisfactorily.
The main conclusions could be mentioned as follows:
•The developed HCWM index was able to optimize the records of waste management in hospitals and determined the weak points in this sector.•By employing outstanding features and measures from decision support systems in the presented index, such as optimistic degree, DMs’ power, and consensus degree, a more realistic judgment of waste management conditions in hospitals could be achieved.•This index has computer-aided approach using specific software, which could result in greater willingness of experts and managers to use the index and better control this part of hospitals.•This HCWM index offers a flexible framework in which the criteria type and number, DMs’ opinions, and the number of hospitals could be easily set for local circumstances. Thus, this index could be applied globally (the exact numerical values used in the example of Shiraz are not intended).•Applying this methodology would help better process modeling not only for health-care waste management experts but also for end-users of other administrative wards of a hospital to monitor their intended process performance and improve their assessments, data minimization, and establishing digital documentation systems in hospitals.
