In this study, we explored the applicability of eigen values of the covariance matrix corresponding to co-efficient matrix of the multivariate AR model as novel features for classifying three non-motor cognitive task in EEG based BCI system. The coefficient matrix of the sixth order multivariate AR model corresponding to the most sensitive IMF group generates feature space which is very useful for the classification of EEG signals related to different mental task. The extracted features are in time domain and this makes our approach suitable for real time implementation. The extracted feature vectors were classified by LS-SVM classifier with three different kernel functions namely, linear, polynomial and radial basis function. The highest value of average classification accuracy of 94.3% obtained for binary classification exceeds 91.4% of the same in previous works. Besides, we obtained average classification accuracy of 77.7% for three class classification. Our proposed approach for analysis of EEG signals using MVAR model in the MEMD domain is novel and quite encouraging. It opens up a number of directions for further analysis of EEG signals in diverse application domains. Future research may involve extracting eigen value features from the 2D or 3D PSR of the most sensitive IMF or a number of sensitive IMFs and the results should be compared with the current research approach. Finally, it would be of great interest to try the proposed methodology for classification of other biomedical signals like electro cardiogram (ECG), electromyogram (EMG) etc. in the context of developing medical diagnostic expert system software.
