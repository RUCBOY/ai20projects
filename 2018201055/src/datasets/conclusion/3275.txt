The main contributions of this paper are on the one hand a notion of morphism between open games and — based on this notion — the representation of the infinite iteration of a given game as a final coalgebra. This provides a first extension of the compositionality results from Ghani et al. [3] to infinitely repeated games. Nevertheless a number of challenges remain: firstly, we need to extend our construction to state-full games and to games with non-trivial coutility function. The former seems straightforward. Of course we want to use this framework to provide new reasoning tools for such games based on coinduction and coalgebraic logics.
