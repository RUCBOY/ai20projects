A comprehensive work enclosing a computational study focused on TiO2/G and TiO2/GO interfaces, and the experimental photocatalytic performance of these nanocomposites with different contents of G and GO was carried out. Computational results of the fundamental electronic properties of the nanocomposites have shown that these are potentially more efficient than pure TiO2, due to their lower energy gap and to the existence of a charge separation at the interfaces, which reduces the recombination of electron-hole pairs. The nanocomposites characterization, through SEM, and FTIR confirmed the interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and G or GO. Additionally, the reflectance measurements corroborate the computational results, with lower band gaps for the nanocomposites (ranging from 2.94 to 2.35 eV) compared with TiO2 (3.08 eV). Experimental results revealed that the nanocomposites degrade more efficiently the MB than the TiO2, but the opposite occurs for CIP. These results indicate that the photocatalytic efficiency depends not only on the properties of the catalyst but also on the compound to degrade and its favorable/unfavorable interactions with the catalytic surface. In this situation, CIP does not have an efficient interaction with the nanocomposite surface, which promotes low adsorption and adverse outcomes for the photocatalytic process. Therefore, further theoretical and experimental studies are required with different pollutants to fully elucidate the mechanism behind the observed behavior of these composites and to be able to accurately match photocatalyst properties with specific pollutants for an optimized degradation.
