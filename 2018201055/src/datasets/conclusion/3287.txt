In the current work, computer simulation was carried out to investigate separation of explosive molecules by HPLC filled with PISAF or SiC8. The simulation took the advantage that the structure of column is infinitely repeated, hence, analysis can be carried out in longer distance of column (about an order of magnitude than usual MD simulation). In addition to this, the column filled with polymeric sorbent was build to have a tunnel to let molecules pass through. Our simulation result agrees well with experimental observations. The interactions between molecules and column were investigated and results showed that electrostatic interaction is the major factor for the molecules to move in the column. This work illustrates a feasible way for the computation of column separation. Follow the method of this research, it will be helpful for the future designation of the column in HPLC technique by computational calculation before experiment.
