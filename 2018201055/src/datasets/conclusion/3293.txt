Constructive discussions between engineering bodies in the fields of metallurgy and construction may accelerate the commercialization of new steel grade products. In the present study, reinforced steel bars with high yield strength of over 600 MPa and good tensile-to-yield ratio above 1.25, with or without the use of the TempCore process, were successfully produced with an alloy design approach based on thermodynamics and a cooling process design approach using FE simulation. The alloy satisfied the requirements for grade 600 MPa reinforced steel bars for seismic safety in South Korea. Recent developments in computational thermodynamics and application software have made it possible to design a suitable material as well as support engineers of steel manufacturing companies in producing the designed material with minimized benchmarks in practical operation processes. It was found that the macroscopic dual-phase microstructure of a reinforced steel bar with a low V level is very suitable for higher tensile-to-yield ratio because it offers good strain capacity due to the initial yielding in the soft ferrite phase, and subsequent strain hardening during load transfer to hard phases, such as pearlite and tempered martensite. These findings indicate that macroscopic dual-phase microstructure with ferrite-pearlite and tempered martensite should be developed through precise alloy and process design, which involve precipitation strengthening and rapid cooling conditions. Therefore, in order to develop reinforced steel bars with improved combinations of higher strength, tensile-to-yield ratio, and uniform elongation in the future, more in-depth studies are required to understand the correlations between microstructural factors and tensile properties.
