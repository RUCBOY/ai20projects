Although innovative methods for the analysis of phytoplankton (Cytofluorimetry, molecular biology, etc.) have been developed in recent years, optical microscopy still remains the most widely used for phytoplankton analysis. Most of the large-scale monitoring programs require the application of this technique, which alone allows comparison with previous data on phytoplankton abundance and diversity. However, microscopic analysis is time-consuming, tedious and complex, and is subject to errors depending on operator expertise. The use of toolkits such as PhytoNumb3rs makes it possible to improve the operability of the method by supporting the analyst step by step, from sample processing to data management and data storage. This makes it possible to obtain high-quality databases, reducing random errors generated by the operator (typing, wrong names, etc.). The large-scale distribution of PhytoNumb3rs is advantageous because the toolkit is free-access and is developed by combining Excel files. In addition, widespread dissemination of this toolkit can improve the interoperability and integration of phytoplankton data collected by separate research and monitoring programs.
