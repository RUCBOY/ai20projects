We have shown that a greedy pivot selection strategy is consistently 1.2 to 2.4 times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms of Tomita et al. (2006) and Naudé (2016) for many structured and unstructured benchmark instances when combined with bit-parallelism and a static maximum-degree-first ordering of the vertices. Though similar techniques have long been known to be successful in solving the MCP, this is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, they are being applied to MCE. Moreover, ordering vertices by maximum degree is not a standard ordering used by exact MCP solvers, as it has been observed to slow down search (Tomita and Kameda, 2006). In contrast, they branch on those vertices with smaller degree at the root node, which tends to produce small subproblems in the shallower levels of the tree.
The success of our approach leaves open three major questions for future research. First, are there other techniques from MCP algorithms that can further improve algorithms for MCE? Next, are there other simple pivot selection methods that can further improve MCE algorithms? Finally, is it possible to gain more speed from bit-parallelism when combined with pivoting in MCE algorithms?
