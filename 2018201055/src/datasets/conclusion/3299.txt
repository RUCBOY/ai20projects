The problem of orthogonal (g, f)-factorizations in graphs or networks has been investigated for more than 20 years. In this paper, we present a graph having (g, f)-factorizations randomly r-orthogonal to n vertex disjoint mr-subgraphs of G, which extends the problem of orthogonal (g, f)-factorizations in graphs or networks. There are several methods used to verify the existence of orthogonal (g, f)-factorizations in graphs or networks. Orthogonal factorizations in graphs or networks have attracted a great deal of attention due to their applications in network design, circuit layout, combinatorial design, coloring, and so on. Hence, there are theoretical and practical significance in studying the problem of orthogonal (g, f)-factorizations in graphs or networks.
