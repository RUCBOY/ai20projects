Corrosion inhibition of mild steel was investigated in 1 M HCl in the presence and absence different concentrations of CBAT. Our compound functioned as an effective corrosion inhibitor for the corrosion of mild steel in 1 M HCl. The inhibition potency increased with increasing inhibitor concentration. CBAT is a mixed type inhibitor and protects by forming a surface film through adsorption. The functional groups present in CBAT lead to the formation of a protective layer, thereby prevent the steel from corrosion. Present inhibitor could be a potential alternate for hazardous corrosion inhibitors. Future studies will focus on the application of this inhibitor under different conditions such as the inhibition of copper and brass corrosion.
