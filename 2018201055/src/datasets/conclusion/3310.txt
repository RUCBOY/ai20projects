We developed a novel SVM-based method to predict AFPs. In this method, each protein has been encoded by four features (evolutionary profile, amino acid composition, Hydropathy, and physicochemical properties). The results indicated that these types of features can significantly improve the prediction of AFPs. The obtained results on two benchmark datasets revealed the strength of our method in AFP detection. Also, the results on an independent test set confirmed the better performance of the proposed method regarding the current state-of-the-art AFP prediction methods. In addition, the more analysis we did, disclosed the poor performance of BLAST in AFP detection and so indicates the critical need for an accurate tool for this purpose. Finally, evolutionary profile and amino acid composition showed the most applicable power in discriminating AFPs from non-AFPs.
