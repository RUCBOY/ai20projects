This study divided students into six latent classes on the basis of their exploration behavior in computer-based CPS tasks. Three of these classes and around 62% of the students reflected mostly quantitative differences. However, the remaining 38% of the students exhibited patterns that differed qualitatively. Providing the type (as opposed to the mere level) of exploration strategy across CPS tasks could provide important information to teachers in terms of both early diagnostics and interventions. That is, providing information to teachers on where students stand in regard to their exploration behavior and how they differ qualitatively, could lead teachers to offer different types of support to different groups of students. For instance, both nonpersisting explorers and rapid learners start out at about the same level (cf. Fig. 2), but both the support and the tasks given to them would differ substantially on the background of their group membership (e.g., demanding and challenging tasks for the rapid learners, but rather motivational support for nonpersisting explorers).
Even further, this kind of class categorization can be considered a first step toward developing a typology of different explorers that can be used in the classroom but also in technology-driven endeavors to improve education such as auto-tutoring. Specifically, one could easily imagine a computer-simulated agent that gives advice on the background of class membership, which in turn could be estimated on the backdrop of exploration behavior in some initial tasks. While we agree that much work needs to be done before widespread application in the classroom is feasible, general thinking skills that are relevant across domains and that transfer across situations become increasingly important as relevant educational outcomes. Understanding quantitative and qualitative differences in the foundations of these skills is a core mission of educational psychology.
