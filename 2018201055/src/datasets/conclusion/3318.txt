In this paper, we proposed a novel method for identifying influential communities in social networks with use of users’ emotional behavior as well as users’ influence in a specific timeframe. The proposed method is based on the emotional content of each post addressed by a user as well as on her influence metric as long as she participates in a specific topic. Thereafter, since all users are assigned a specific influence metric and in following are modeled as emotional or neutral, the proposed method identifies the most influential communities based on these two features. The results obtained support our schema for identifying influential communities as it outperforms the popular modularity optimization method used in related works.
Future work will focus on scalability problems that emerge when analyzing bigger graphs. In addition, it is in our keen interest to examine the performance of the methodology using several subjects and identify the parameters that influence its performance in a finer granularity level. Another key aspect of our future work will be the integration of our approach in initiatives and existing methods for viral marketing and for branches’ advertising purposes. Finally, another aspect to examine is the evolution of influential communities in time with the utilization of temporal networks.
