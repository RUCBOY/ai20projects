These multi-institutional comparisons using a Clarkson-based algorithm should help to determine departmental action levels. The patient populations and treatment sites referred for treatment with CyberKnife, Vero4DRT, and TomoTherapy may be more limited and specific than those treated using C-arm linacs from Varian, Elekta, and Siemens, which cover all treatment sites. Similar to the action levels of AAPM TG114 for non-IMRT plans, a 5% action level for non-IMRT, IMRT, and VMAT plans for CyberKnife, Vero4DRT, and TomoTherapy seem justifiable in all sites, except for lung sites and those requiring a large treatment field to a large area of homogenous media under heterogeneous conditions. Larger systematic differences were present for lung sites when using a small treatment field because of the large impact of differences in the heterogeneity corrections of the different dose calculation algorithms between the primary TPS and the verification program. If a range between âˆ’5% and +5% is to be defined as the action level, a heterogeneity correction for the Clarkson method would be helpful.
