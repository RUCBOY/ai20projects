The PDS4 Information Model provides the necessary shared knowledge about digital objects in the PDS repository to drive the PDS4 Information System. The PDS4 Information Model is implementation independent and remains relevant within a diverse set of evolving science disciplines.
The Information Model improves interoperability by being ontology-based and having a multi-level governance scheme. The ontology enables interoperability by adding context to vocabulary terms by means of class hierarchies and relationships. Multi-level governance includes a common model for interoperability at the broadest level, discipline level models for science discipline interoperability, and mission models local level interoperability.
In 2002, the National Virtual Observatory Science Definition Team said, “It is probably safe to say that no other professional community has reached the level of data interchange standards (both syntax and semantics) that we have reached in astronomy.” (NVO Science Definition Team, 2002) The PDS4 Information Model has enabled a new level of interoperability across the diverse science disciplines of the Planetary Science community. The acceptance of PDS4 by the International Planetary Data Alliance and the planned integration of the EPN-TAP interface and VESPA framework is evidence that the PDS4 Information Architecture is enabling interoperability across the Planetary Sciences and related space science disciplines, such as Heliophysics.
