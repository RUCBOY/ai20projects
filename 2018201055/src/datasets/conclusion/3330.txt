The multimodal plant identification system is designed in this research work. The proposed approaches have been implemented on VISLeaf dataset. The dataset is divided into 70:30 ratio for training and testing purpose, respectively. We have adopted feature level fusion to achieve multimodal plant identification. Firstly we produced results using non-imaging spectral signatures reflectance as a features. We acquired 420*500 and 180*500 dimensions feature matrix from spectral reflectance as a training and testing set respectively. Similarly we extend the features using scanned leaf images, we produce vein features, geometric features and HOG descriptor features succeeded by fusion of these features using concatenation method and we fabricated 420*620, 180*620 dimension feature matrix as a training set and testing set respectively. The evaluation of the system performed on the various type of feature sets shows that the Vein features were able to produce maximum accuracy of 78.51% GAR with 20.30 of FAR and 22.66 FRR when threshold value was 0.13. Similarly the HOG features achieved 88.33% GAR accuracy with 12.13 of FAR and 11.2 of FRR with 0.35 threshold value. The Geometric features produced the 94.39% of accuracy with 5.16 of FAR and 5.6 of FRR with threshold value was set to be 5.60. It is observed that he spectral features were better than of Vein features and HOG features with accuracy of 93.51% of GAR with 6.48 ERR. And the FAR and FRR was 6.89 and 6.06 respectively. The system achieved highest accuracy using feature level fusion with 98.03% GAR with 1.96 ERR and 2.93, 1 FAR and FRR respectively. Feature fusion is outperformed over non-imaging spectral data only. The fusion of feature improves the GAR with 3.64%, 4.51% with respect to separate geometric features and spectral features respectively.
