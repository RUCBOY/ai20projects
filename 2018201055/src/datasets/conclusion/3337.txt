We have presented the fundamental theory of Uncertain Logic Processing (ULP), a DS theoretic approach for first order logic operations. ULP provides support for handling uncertain fundamental logic operations (i.e., ¬,∧,∨, ⇒), combinations of these fundamental operations, variables, and logic quantifiers. The framework presented in this paper allows systematic generation of mass assignments based on uncertain first order logic formulas.
The use of DS theory as the substrate for modeling and tracking the propagation of uncertainty in the ULP framework provides us with important advantages such as the ability of modeling uncertainty using intervals (instead of being limited by sometimes restrictive probability values), ability for quantifying ignorance on the truth value of logical formulas or propositions, providing a principled way of refining uncertainty intervals without relying on priors or membership functions, and allowing compatibility with probabilistic models, among others.
ULP can be tuned for consistency with classical logic, rendering the classical logic results when the scenario represents “perfect” (i.e., without uncertainty) data/models. The consistency with classical logic gives the confidence to apply our proposed models as an extension of classical logic in reasoning. Given the parameterized presentation of the uncertain logic operations, extensions of ULP could be designed to address, in addition to consistency with classical logic, consistency with paraconsistent logics.
