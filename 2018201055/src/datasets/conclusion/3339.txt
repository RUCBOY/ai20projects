A CAD based methodology to construct 3T-junction of two similar zig-zag nanotubes is developed in this work. The method uses optimization and remeshing of the triangular mesh and the centroid based dual mesh to create nanotube junctions at different angles of contact. The geometry of the remeshing surface at the junction determines the number and type of defects (non-hexagonal polygons) in the junction. The bond surplus of the junction created isÂ +6 which is a necessity for the topologically accurate 3T-junction. It is also shown that more hierarchical structures, such as 4T-junctions, junction clusters, 2D and 3D periodic microstructures can be formulated via replication, translation and rotation of the developed 3T-junctions along x-, y- and z-directions. Thus, with this CAD based meshing approach, large and complex carbon nanotube networks can be generated with less computational effort. These nanotube macrostuctures can then be studied using conventional atomistic based simulation techniques to understand their properties for potential applications in various fields of interest.
