While the all-pole model used in low-bit-rate linear predictive coding describes the spectra of voiced sounds well, the branching of the vocal tract during the formation of nasal sounds makes it difficult for the lower-order (<20) all-pole model to simulate the spectra of nasal voices accurately. A generalized Levinson-Durbin algorithm is proposed in this paper, which extends the iteration step size of the conventional Levinson-Durbin algorithm from 1 to any positive integer not greater than the order of the matrix. Relevant derivations are then carried out. When the iteration step is 1, the generalized algorithm is the conventional Levinson-Durbin algorithm. When the iteration step equals the matrix order, the generalized algorithm is only a matrix inversion procedure. The generalized and conventional algorithms are used together in linear predictive coding. With the size of the first six iterations set at 1, and the next two iterations set at 2, the quality of nasal syllables in synthesized speech is improved to a certain extent.
