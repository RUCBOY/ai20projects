This article is the first to present an investigation of the usage of variants by end-user programmers. Our survey allowed us to pose answers to three questions.
•RQ1: How and why do end users create variants?Our survey results revealed that end users do indeed reuse programs they create and code shared with teams. This suggests that being able to understand the differences between variants is important. Further, when working in teams, having information about the authors of code is important.•RQ2: How do end users find variants?While looking for variants, end users prefer to run code and look at outputs, to access source code and meta information such as filenames, and to refer to the creation and update dates of programs. When selecting variants users prefer to look at their major features such as correctness, similarity and authorship information.•RQ3: How do end users manage variants?End users rely primarily on memory to track changes. They seldom make use of online or configuration management tools.
The results of our survey motivated the need for a variation management system by which end users can access and assess variants. Therefore, we developed AppInventorHelper (AIH), a variation aware system for end users working in the App Inventor environment. Our formative user study showed that AIH helps organize information on variants. We also found that AIH helps users explore and reuse variants, and understand code evolution.
Our study of AIH uncovered several potential new design requirements. Participants wished to see explicit information on whether code was correct or not. They wished to have features abstracted to help them find apps and determine the differences and similarities between variants, and they wanted to have a roadmap with the ability to zoom in and out. Our research indicates that incorporating these new requirements into AIH may significantly help improve users’ interactions with the system.
