As streaming time-series is real-time data, which cannot be preloaded and preprocessed. Besides, multi-subsequence monitoring requires faster execution time compared to the single case. In this paper, we proposed a novel algorithm called forward-propagation NSPRING (FPNS) for multi-subsequence monitoring on streaming time-series. Specifically, FPNS needs to calculate a n by m matrix. Among the matrix, necessary cells in the matrix are indexed and calculated while all unnecessary ones are ignored, so that to speed up the execution time. FPNS is 3 times faster than NSPRING and a order of magnitude faster than UCR-DTW on average. The time complexity of FPNS is O(lnm). Note FPNS is extended from NSPRING and does not revise the output of it, thus FPNS preserves the same accuracy with NSPRING. In the experiments, we observe that the pruning ability of UCR-DTW does not perform well for multi-subsequence monitoring problem, which makes the running time of UCR-DTW closer to its time complexity, i.e. O(lnm2).
In addition to NSPRING, the concept of forward-propagation can be adopted in any DTW based algorithms. Along this direction, we are currently extending other DTW-based algorithms for multi-subsequence monitoring as future work.
