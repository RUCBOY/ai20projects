In this article, we have presented LEPTON, an emulation platform we designed for opportunistic networking development. This platform is meant to constitute a lightweight emulation solution that bridges the gap between pure simulation, and real-world experimentation. With LEPTON, full-featured application and/or middleware code can run in an emulated environment, in which only the mobility of network nodes is simulated. The code running on each network node is therefore the same code that could run on a mobile device. In fact, instances of the system under test can be executed concurrently on real mobile devices (such as smartphones or tablets), on a single workstation, or on a cluster of workstations, while LEPTON simulates their mobility and drives transmissions accordingly.
Initial experiments conducted with two existing opportunistic systems have confirmed that such systems can be easily adapted to run with LEPTON, and that running opportunistic networking scenarios in such conditions constitute an excellent stress test for these systems. They have also shown that weaknesses in the system under test can be revealed while running demanding application scenarios in emulation mode, while they could perfectly remain undetected when running pure simulations, or when running on a handful of experimentation platforms.
Future work shall aim at extending the set of mobility models offered in LEPTON, as well as the set of complementary tools that facilitate the analysis of log files after an experiment.
