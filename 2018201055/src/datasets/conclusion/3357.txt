The proposed fully automatic framework showed its promising for IAS interventional planning, making the planning more accurate, simpler, without observer variability and faster. The new atrial region segmentation approach obtained results comparable to the remaining state-of-the-art methods, but providing superior results for the mid atrial walls. No differences were found between the new and our previous segmentation approaches; however, it should be noted that with the new approach, the segmentation is free of user interaction. Regarding the fossa ovalis segmentation, the proposed method obtained results similar to the ones manually delineated by experts, allowing a correct and fast identification of the optimal route for transseptal puncture or optimal device selection for LA interventions.
