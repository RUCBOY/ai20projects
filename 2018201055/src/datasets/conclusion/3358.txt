In this paper, we proposed an automatic method for the accurate segmentation of the BROI and BD. BROI segmentation is achieved by combining pixelwise adaptive filtering, k-means clustering and morphological operations with the application of local adaptive thresholding. BD segmentation is obtained by a combined method using fuzzy c means thresholding and mean value histogram. These frameworks have been tested on 15 different cases that comprised of different shapes and density patterns. Furthermore, quantitative analysis was carried with different evaluation metrics (Acc, Sp, AUC, MR, P, Se, DSC and JC) to demonstrate the segmentation quality when compared with manually segmented results by an expert. Most particularly, it is observed that the proposed algorithm is highly effective on breast MRIs with dense BD that has an similar intensity level to the area near the pectoral muscle. The presented model can act as a preliminary step that further assists in the diagnosis of breast cancer.
