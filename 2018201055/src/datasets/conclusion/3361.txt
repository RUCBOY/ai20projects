Calibers has demonstrated, in an ideal situation of a controlled environment, that TCP congestion avoidance algorithms, while performing well at maximizing network utilization, it cannot provide the desired behavior for workflow orchestration. In particular, TCP relies on network characteristic, such as RTT, packet retransmission, pace flows and ignore flow needs. As result some flows may go faster than they need, while others may go slower than they should, such to meet deadlines and maximize resource utilization. However, the performance of modern TCP, in conjunction with the ability of SDN to implement centralized traffic engineering, allows Calibers to optimize network utilization to provide predictable performance. Our preliminary study on dynamic pacing algorithms suggests that simple heuristics that optimize locally on the most bottlenecked link can perform almost as well as attempts to optimize globally.
In our future work, we will address some of the assumptions that we made in this preliminary work. In particular, we will consider the interaction between deadline aware traffic and background traffic. We will investigate methods to predict the background traffic and leave appropriate network capacity to minimize the impact on the deadline aware traffic. This work will also enhance Calibers to accept deadline aware data transfer request at a future time.
