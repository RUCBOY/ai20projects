We presented a study to motivate measures to reduce the substantial gap between peak and average loads in research and education networks. Using logs from production GridFTP servers, we simulated high data transfer loads by keeping the network capacity at current levels while increasing the demands made on the network by individual transfers. We showed that doubling the load while maintaining the current network capacity can reduce the gap between peak and average throughput by an average of 18% while resulting in a minimal impact on data transfer performance, suggesting that there is room to increase load on current networks. We also showed that when the transfers are categorized into on-demand and best-effort, with preferential treatment for on-demand transfers, the impact on the transfers that really need on-demand service can be made negligible, while at the same time keeping the impact on best-effort transfers minimal, under 2.0Ã— on average when the transfer load is doubled.
