We have introduced the concept of a system algebra, which captures the composition of systems as algebraic operations, and identified composition-order invariance as an important property of a system algebra. We have then introduced functional system algebras, which consist of systems that correspond to functions mapping inputs to outputs. As instantiations of functional system algebras, we have considered monotone ands continuous systems, where Kahn networks are an important special case of them. We have shown their composition-order invariance, providing further insights into these well-studied systems. We have finally introduced the system algebra of causal systems, which allows to model systems that depend on time.
Future work includes using the system algebra of causal systems to analyze protocols that deal with time such as clock synchronization protocols. We are further developing a theory of probabilistic system algebras that can be used to describe and study cryptographic protocols.
