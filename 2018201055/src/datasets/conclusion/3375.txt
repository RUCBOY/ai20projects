In the US, existing network paradigm that support big data science consists of three major components: terabit networks that provide high network bandwidths, Data Transfer Nodes (DTNs) and Science DMZ architecture that bypasses the performance hotspots in typical campus networks, and on-demand secure circuits/paths reservation systems, such as ESnet OSCARS and Internet2 AL2S, which provides automated, guaranteed bandwidth service in WAN. This network paradigm has proven to be very successful. However, to reach its full potentials, we claim that existing network paradigm for big data science must address three major problems: the last mile problem, the scalability problem, and the programmability problem.
We proposed the AmoebaNet solution to address these problems. AmoebaNet applies Software Defined Networking (SDN) technology to provide “QoS-guaranteed” network service in campus or local area networks. An initial version of AmoebaNet has been tested in Fermilab SDN testbed. The evaluation results show that AmoebaNet complements existing network paradigm for big data science: it allows applications to program networks at run-time to suit their needs; and, in conjunction with WAN circuits/paths reservation system such as ESnet OSCARS and Internet2 AL2S, it solves the last mile problem and the scalability problem.
Ideally, AmoebaNet should be compared with alternative solutions in terms of performance and capabilities. However, it is difficult for us to find alternative solutions to compare with AmoebaNet, due to several reasons. First, there are few alternative solutions that provide similar features as AmoebaNet in support of big data science. Second, although there many SDN research projects and efforts, few projects have developed software packages or systems that can be physically deployed.
