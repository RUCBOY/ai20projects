Complex networks can be decomposed into subgraphs called communities. Several fast local community detection methods have been proposed using several conditions that should be satisfied by communities in networks by various authors. A too strong conditions for similarity of each node to community have a tendency to create a large number of small, but not necessary also relevant communities. We have proposed the MME algorithm which detects all communities using more different measures that can fast identify communities of different sizes and densities. More used measures provide better results. The MME extracts communities one at a time, allowing arbitrary structure in the remainder of network that can contain weakly or tightly connected nodes. The proposed method is able to identify communities both overlapping and non-overlapping. The algorithm can detects communities at different resolutions and reveals rich information on input networks. We will apply the proposed method for large scale online networks.
