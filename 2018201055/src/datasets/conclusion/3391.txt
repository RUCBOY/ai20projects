In this paper, we first introduce our FLowell Science DMZ infrastructure, which is designed to overcome the shortcomings in our current campus network in order to accelerate large-volume data transfers. With the dedicated Science DMZ path, we are able to achieve reducing latency from 5.4 ms to 3.5 ms while simultaneously increasing throughput from 91.8 Mbps to 9.2 Gbps. As a result, the file transfer time is reduced significantly, particularly for large file sizes. More importantly, we propose a policy engine on top of the network control plane. The policy engine enables network users to submit demands for network resources, which, for valid requests, are automatically and immediately serviced. As a result, user to administrator interactions, specifically in terms of the network resource request approval process, are simplified and can be finished in 1 s. At the same time, network administrators can leverage policy rules to manage the data paths within the network. Currently our code is not published yet but it is on our roadmap to publish it after cleaning up the source code.
