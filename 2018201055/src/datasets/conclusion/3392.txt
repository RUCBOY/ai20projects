The paper shows how traditional data analysis methods from computer science can be used as an exploratory approach for building environmental data. As an example, we applied the method to year-long monitored data from a building in India. The methods proposed here have rarely been used for such data, yet this is a promising approach for quickly analyzing complex datasets, and using simplified measures such as air temperature as proxies for estimating unmeasured variables such as shading and status of the air-conditioning system. The method can be easily applied to other datasets with different characteristics, such as including a wider set of measured variables, different building types, and climate zones. As the methods get adopted within the field of building science, it would be interesting to assess the scalability of the approach and its significance as a prediction method. From a methodological perspective, additional links between the fields of computer science and building science could lead to more innovative investigations by applying statistical algorithms (e.g. CHAID and QUEST), advanced decision tree methods (e.g., Extra Trees, Gradient Tree Boosting), and further approaches for feature attributes approximation.
