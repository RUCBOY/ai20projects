In this paper, we have carefully designed an SSVEP-based BCI system with cheap and portable devices, which can achieve high bit rate. The system can be integrated into security applications such as defending against shoulder-surfing attacks, and provide assistive care for people with motor disability as well. The cheap and portable devices in our BCI system impose several challenges and complicate the entire system design. Through extensive experiments, we have designed an optimization framework to process the weak signal and have determined an optimal stimulus configuration by considering various factors.
We have built a prototype and evaluated it with real experiments. The bit rate of our system on computer monitor is 54.8 bits/min on average, which is comparable to that of existing systems with expensive and laboratory-oriented devices and is the best so far with such portable devices. We believe that this is an appealing accomplishment in this area. Furthermore, we are the first to design and evaluate the SSVEP-based BCI system by displaying stimuli on a smartphone screen, with an average bit rate of 17.3 bits/min.
