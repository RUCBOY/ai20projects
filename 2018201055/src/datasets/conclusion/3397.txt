Power prediction for PV panels is needed for accurate power planning and monitoring. Hence, in this paper, we presented an efficient hardware implementation that models the output power of heterogeneous PV panels. The hardware implementation was made possible by developing a very small artificial neural network, which accurately modeled the output power of heterogeneous PV panels. The presented hardware model showed high accuracy and fast response time, which enables it to be included as a module in a real-time PV panels monitoring system.
The power of PV panels have been generated from an applied MatLab code, which analyses the output P-V characteristics of the validated PV model. Afterward, the estimated power and meteorological data have been used for training the proposed FFNN.
Simulation results were obtained by the implementation of the HPV-ANN topology using the ATmega2560 microcontroller. Result shows that the proposed module exhibits excellent performance under variable atmospheric conditions. The use of ANN allows the system to be easily updated to adapt for future PV systems. This is possible by updating the new weights after recalculating and offline training.
