This study mainly suggests that ICT professional development activities might increase ICT activities related to constructivist learning implementation. With the growing attention paid to lifelong learning skills, teachers should be encouraged to participate in programs such as online learning communities. Ongoing interactions might enrich their knowledge and skills obtained through periodic training programs. Through such communities and practice platforms, they can exchange information, converse through an online threaded discussion forum as well as within small and large group face-to-face meetings as part of their ICT professional development activities. Such ICT-based training programs might raise the functioning and productivity of professional learning (Prestridge, 2009). Through these routes of information and collaboration, teachers might be exposed to effective ICT practices (Richardson, 2010) such as e-portfolio, blogs, wikis, podcasts, and other powerful web tools for classrooms that might help supporting students' and teachers' 21st-century learning skills.
