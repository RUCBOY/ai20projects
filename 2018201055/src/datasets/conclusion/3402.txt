Although LIS authors have published articles in non-LIS journals (Higgins et al., 2017; Larivi√®re et al., 2012), this phenomenon has not attracted the attention of researchers. This study focused on interdisciplinary LIS authors and contributes to a better understanding of the characteristics of interdisciplinary LIS authors and their articles. Interdisciplinary LIS authors with diverse disciplinary backgrounds and research interests do cross over disciplines. Interdisciplinary LIS authors do strengthen the interdisciplinary nature of LIS. Several unique findings were identified from this study which can enrich studies on the interdisciplinary characteristics of LIS. This research demonstrates that studies on interdisciplinary characteristics of a given discipline should not be limited to the landscape of that discipline. Interdisciplinarity means just that. Exploring the interdisciplinarity of a discipline from the perspective of interdisciplinary researchers is an important approach.
