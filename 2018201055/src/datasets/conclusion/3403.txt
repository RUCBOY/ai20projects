Online platforms can now provide researchers with data that indicate what resources students are using, how they come to understand concepts, and what behaviors reflect effective study strategies. Thus, these platforms allow us to study learning at a deeper level than we have been able to. In this study, we examine how students use very simple online task-level feedback to master material that they may not have encountered before, recognizing that feedback is integral to the learning process. The data show us that students who take advantage of that feedback and use techniques associated with self-regulation and productive struggle have stronger results in the course. These findings can be used by instructors to design better features of online learning platforms, integrate online activities with the face-to-face components of their courses, and guide students on using online material advantageously.
