Serious gaming in English vocabulary learning presents a true potential because the game-based nature is reflected in some particularities that the traditional learning approach does not have, like fun or interaction.
6.1. Major findingsWe designed a mixed research method to test three hypotheses through two experiments and two interviews. We conclude that the interactivity-prone serious gaming is significantly more effective than the less interactivity-prone serious gaming in English vocabulary learning at the significance level p=.05; the less interactivity-prone serious gaming is significantly more effective than the traditional approach in English vocabulary learning at the significance level p=.05; and males significantly outperformed females in serious game-aided English vocabulary learning at the significance level p=.05. We also discussed the features that should be considered when a serious game is designed to assist English vocabulary learning.
6.2. Advantages and disadvantagesThe integration of qualitative research methods into the quantitative enhanced the reliability and validity, together with proper sampling and analytical methods. Participants, divided into three groups, were randomly selected, whose number is large enough to represent the population. The regret may be that the selected serious games chosen in the study were off-the-shelf commercial games, as opposed to bespoke educational games designed and developed specifically to test the hypotheses.
6.3. Future research directionsFuture research directions were suggested that serious gaming in English vocabulary learning be integrated into interdisciplinary research such as cooperation between computer science, education, psychology, applied linguistics and statistics.
