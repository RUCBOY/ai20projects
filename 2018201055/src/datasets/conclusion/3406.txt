In summary, we build a new family of modular network space with multiple hub-vertex. For larger t, they are sparse. We gain the degree distribution, the clustering coefficient, the upper and lower bound of diameter and average path length on our models N(t). Eq. (7) says the average degree of the Nj(t) equals 7 and is smaller. Eq. (9) shows that the degree distribution of the Nj(t) follows exponential scale. Eq. (11) indicates the average clustering coefficient of our model Nj(t) is higher. Eq. (16) and Eq. (25) represent that the diameter and the average path length of Nj(t) scale logarithmically with the number of network vertices. Hence, all members of N(t) are both exponential-scale and small-world. After that, we probe the number of spanning trees in more detail and get a precise analytical solution for the number of spanning trees of the model NB(t). We note that although we only study some topological parameters on small-world models in a network space, which is made from all kinds of elements by randomly chosen vertices and connecting edges between them. Our results, at p=1, suggest that such a growing way has no serious impact on APL and every resulting model still has lower average path length as well as is small-world. We hope that our work can provide a new method for establishing small-world network models. We also believe that there is a lot of work to do in research the relationship between random models and deterministic ones in the following future. As a future exploring direction, we can make our models become more stochastic through adjusting the value of linking probability p and both the number and connection ways among these chosen hub-vertex [[34], [35], [36]].
