The variation in CTDIvol, DLP and scanning protocol in HN cancer RT localisation CT imaging across Irish departments warrant the establishment of DRLs. It may be necessary to consider BMI specific modified RT CT protocols and this area warrants further investigation. This research proposes DRLs for RT CT imaging in the HN region and provides a platform for dose comparison and optimisation of CT localisation protocols.
