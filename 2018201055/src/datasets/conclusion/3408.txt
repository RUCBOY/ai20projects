Since, channel noise plays a very important role for data transmission in heterogeneous network, which will affect the performance parameters of the network. The proposed work has been highlighting on increase in reliability by controlling bit error rate and reducing packet loss by energy management. The scheme has been compared with single SNR parameter with our multi-parameter such as delay energy and noise, which shows substantial increase in the throughput. So our scheme aimed to achieve better results with neural network simulation.
