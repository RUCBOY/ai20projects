We have analysed in depth a capacity problem for an open-pit mining system which can be considered as a prototype for a class of general production–transportation systems. A main specification is low variability of the determining stochastic variables. In case of reliable production we proposed to apply an algorithm which was proposed already in the literature for the special situation of open-pit mining. If production suffers from unreliable machines or interrupts by environmental changes we recommend to apply a modification of this algorithm. We tested our new algorithms against standard general purpose algorithms from the performance evaluation literature and found out superior behaviour of the new algorithms.
Future research should explore whether the principles which lead to the proposed algorithms can be modified accordingly for application in more general closed production systems with non-linear topology. A natural candidate for such generalizations is a system where the back-cycle of trucks is overtake-free (or even more: Quasi-overtake-free) in the sense defined in Gordon–Newell networks of single server stations.
A further open problem is the analysis of systems with more than one shovel.
