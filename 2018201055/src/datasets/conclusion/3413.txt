Our motivation for this competition was driven in part by our own frustration that “good” models for penguin population dynamics were elusive, and that few efforts have been made to benchmark models against each other. The data science competition framework offers the opportunity to compare one domain-knowledge inspired population model to domain-agnostic methods commonly used in data science. For our dataset at least, simple models performed comparably to complex models for prediction over the short term, and covariates strongly supported by prior knowledge of the system did not improve prediction accuracy. The domain-knowledge inspired model was competitive with the very best models submitted by the competition, which suggests that at least some of the commonly used tools in statistical ecology (in this case, hierarchical Bayesian time series modelling) are reasonable. Not surprisingly, techniques developed specifically for prediction (e.g., machine learning methods) scored highest. Although limited inference on mechanisms can be made by machine learning based methods, more traditional ecological modelling techniques are more appropriate for understanding cause and effect from hypothesis testing. Data science competitions provide one avenue for jumpstarting development of better predictive models, encourage community-level aggregation of ‘clean’ datasets, and directly facilitate public engagement. For all these reasons, we look forward to seeing future data science competitions for ecological research.
