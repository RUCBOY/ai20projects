Vibration feedback effectively increases the application range of the navigation system, especially when the user can not directly view the touch screen. In this paper, we restore the hand-held vibration feedback device which connected with a plurality of vibrators embedded to explore the recognition rate of vibration feedback modes under different moving speed. Our findings showed that navigation speed affected the recognition rate of vibration pattern significantly. This paper contributes to the basic understanding of vibration feedback and offers implications for the future design of vibration feedback in navigation scenarios. Our two experiments also showed that the accuracy of the user's identification of the vibration direction can reach about 90% when the travel speed is less than or equal to 12â€¯km/h. For the 11 vibration modes, the accuracy of identification is not high and only about 70%, but the idea or direction is correct, it just needs to improve the experimental equipment and experimental steps to improve the identification accuracy of the vibration modes.
