We presented the ARGeo system, an AR system to assist the geologist during fieldwork. It provides the visualization of a fully 3D virtual terrain, that can be used to incorporate geo-tagged virtual elements. PoIs and Virtual Planes are examples of these virtual elements, which can be also interactively modified and visualized from different locations using the Virtual Field Snapshots. ARGeo was shaped using a framework design that enables further improvements incorporating new specialized features.
The conducted tests show the feasibility of ARGeo on the Geology field, and its potential to other Earth Sciences related fields. We identified future lines of work to enhance the usability of ARGeo, as well as to incorporate new dedicated features to the system.
