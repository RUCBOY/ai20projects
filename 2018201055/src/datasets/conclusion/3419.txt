This paper described the use of different techniques implemented in MATLAB for possible fruit disease infection prediction. Beside the prediction of possible diseases Matlab methods were used for data processing, visualization, outlier detection and correction. All implemented algorithms are used for infection prediction on the two specific cherry fruit diseases. Evaluation of all implemented algorithms was performed under the same conditions, and the same evaluation parameters were observed.
By careful selection of the best algorithm based on the evaluation results, very good results in prediction of the class attribute were achieved. The particular problem analyzed in this paper has several benefits. On one side, by predicting the time for infection occurrences, the chemical protection is more efficient so farmers could save money and on the other side, which is far more important, it provides healthier food due to reduced number of chemical treatments. Authorsâ€™ future plan is to extend the tool with automated weather data collection through the network of meteorological stations. Another upgrade in the future will be automatic farmer notification of possible infection through the mobile or Internet network.
