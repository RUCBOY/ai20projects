The increasing interest in applying EMPC in embedded control systems motivated the authors to investigate the problem of evaluating the piecewise functions defined over polyhedral regions. To this aim, a data structure k-d tree was introduced to solve the point location problem in EMPC, which is useful for performing range searches in high-dimensional regions. Based on the data structure k-d tree, the authors propose a method CKDT as the efficient solution for point location problem especially for high dimensional problems or those with a great number of partitions in the state space. Compared with the well known method BST, CKDT selects axis-aligned HPs as the candidate HPs, thus making offline computation much less complex. In summary, CKDT can handle the trade-off between the online efficiency and memory storage requirement well. The effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by experiment results. Compared the existing methods, the method proposed in this paper has two original ideas: i.e. divide the space by the number of the affine control laws; select the axis-aligned HP to split the polyhedral region.
