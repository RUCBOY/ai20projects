In this paper, we have outlined the importance of gathering information for designing science gateways for domain researchers, who want to apply HPC infrastructures and distributed data management on a large scale for simulations. We have presented checklists for developers in interdisciplinary projects considering domain-related, organizational and technical aspects independent of a specific selected technology but as starting point for selecting technologies and designing as well as implementing a science gateway for a community. These checklists can be used to prepare the interaction with domain researchers and to make informed decisions about technologies suitable for specific science gateways. A wide range of mature and maintained web frameworks and science gateway technologies are available to aid developers in designing and implementing such solutions. While each of them have their own communities, they also have their specific advantages and disadvantages for use cases. Aspects such as scalability and feature availability narrow the scope and help to choose the most suitable technology. We described the examples MoSGrid, Apache Airavata and the Agave API as community-driven approaches in detail. They are mature as well as widely used technologies. Our next goal is to support science gateway projects with a manuscript on best practices for science gateway development.
