In this paper, we proposed a fast and high quality algorithm for overlapping community detection based on a novel seeding strategy and a novel community refining method. Our algorithm is able to run much faster than the existing global solutions in the state of the art while getting better communities in quality, and obtains much more accurate community structure than the current local algorithms. The fact that our algorithm can be parallelized indicates that the execution time of our algorithm could be further reduced in a multi-threaded version. Hence, one of the future research lines can be simply changing the algorithm into a multi-threaded version.
