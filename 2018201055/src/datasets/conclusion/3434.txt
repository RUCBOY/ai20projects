In this present work, we built a good predictive 3D-QSAR model, based on the best six-point pharmacophore model, using a collection of dataset from three confirmatory bioassays showing anti-inflammatory activity against COX-2. The pharmacophore model consists of two hydrogen acceptor sites, one hydrophobic site and three aromatic ring sites, this model provides an idea about important functional groups essential for anti-inflammatory activity such as hydrogen bond donor, hydrophobic and electron withdrawing groups, which are clearly responsible for the high activity of the reported inhibitors in this work. Besides, the current pharmacophore model and molecular docking were applied in virtual screening for the identification of novel naturel lead-compounds from the universal natural products database (UNPD), which can be also used as a basis for synthesizing selective inhibitors for COX-2. Furthermore, the realisation of molecular dynamic simulation gave us an insight about the stability of the studied ligand-complex systems for several key parameters (RMSD, RMSF, and potential energy) during the simulation time which supports effectively the 3D-QSAR and docking results.
