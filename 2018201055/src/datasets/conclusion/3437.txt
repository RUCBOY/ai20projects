In this paper, we propose a light weighted novel scheme for secure outsourcing SVD computation on cloud. Our scheme applies the translation and scaling techniques to encrypt a source matrix and allows a secure computation to be done on cloud. Moreover, our scheme can hide all zero elements of the matrix from being exposed on cloud. For the performance, our work significantly helps reduce the computation workload from O(n3) to O(n2). For the security aspects, our analysis and experiments show that the proposed scheme gives secure computation as well as high entropy of the encrypted matrix. As a result, it indicates high resistance to attacks. For further investigation, our proposed scheme can be used for secure outsourcing SVD computation of non-square source matrices.
