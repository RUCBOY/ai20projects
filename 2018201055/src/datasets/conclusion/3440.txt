SEGs and VR promote meaningful use of technology in the science classroom that provides disciplinary convergence through underlying cognitive attributes, affective factors, and skills implementation. Further research should be conducted to understand how the additional cognitive resources required in the processing of VR information affects student learning. More in depth exploration of instructional practices associated with VR environments might allow for the building of effective pedagogies that can be put in place a-priori to support student cognition. The findings from this work support results found in other studies, such as Yamamoto and Nakakoji (2005), who suggest there are underlying cognitive attributes, such as critical thinking, that influence learning in science classrooms and that these attributes can now be measured more directly and accurately. These underlying attributes provide a means to explain similar effects of SEG use in science classrooms and ‘hands-on’ conditions. Using realistic three-dimensional immersive environments as targeted interventions at critical times may help to rebuild the current deficit in science learning.
