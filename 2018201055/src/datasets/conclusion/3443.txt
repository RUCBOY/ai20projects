In this work, this paper considered VRPTW as a multi-objective problem in which the number of vehicles and total traveling distance are minimized while capacity and time window constraints are not violated. An evolutionary algorithm, termed PDVA, is proposed to handle the multi-objective VRPTW, which incorporates a tissue P system and various heuristics. The P system which consists of three cells is applied to build the computing framework with three cells being placed in the same environment, while DGEM and VNEM are applied in two of these three cells as sub-algorithms respectively, and the last cell is used as the output cell, which uses the concept of Pareto's optimality. Between each two cells, cell communication rules are adopted to exchange information between different cells or between a cell and the environment. Despite of the use of tissue P system, the motion equations and related motion rules of glowworm in DGEM are improved to optimize the performance of DGEM, and the search boundary for VNEM is relaxed to enhance its global search ability. Finally, a number of Solomon examples of different sizes are tested. The experimental results show that our algorithm is very competitive with the classical algorithms described in the literature. And the proposed PDVA is capable of obtaining a set of non-dominated solutions, which provides the decision maker sufficient choices for final decision.
In future studies, we will continue to improve algorithm efficiency and challenge large-scale VRPTW. Meanwhile, other types of VRPTW, such as multi-depot vehicle routing problem with time window, vehicle routing problem with soft time window, can be tested by our algorithms with some changes. Besides, the other characters of P system, for example, choosing rules in a non-deterministic manner, it has influence on the performance of approximate algorithms, and that should be considered in the future.
