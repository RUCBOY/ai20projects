In silico studies can save a lot of time and money before reaching the experimental stage. In medicinal chemistry, emphasis is laid on generation of ‘wet’ data, irrespective of what the odds of success might be in terms of late-stage failures. In silico tools can help predict the probable activity spectrum of a probable drug compound and simultaneously provide an insight about various ADMET aspects and toxicological effects. An understanding of various aspects of how a compound affects biological structures, various metabolic processes and pathways and its overall impact on physiological response, is of prime importance. The present study used different prediction rules to predict oral bioavailability of compounds which can lead to a path of discovery of new safer drugs.
