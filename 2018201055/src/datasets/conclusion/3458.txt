Analyzing common image sources is of high importance to digital forensic investigations due to the prevalence of images. This article focused on an important but highly compute-intensive analysis: common source identification where we try to cluster images that have been made with the same source camera while the cameras are not available.
Our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art by using compute infrastructure with GPUs to the maximum so that we do not need to trade off accuracy for performance. Our contributions are:
1.We provide a detailed explanation of our approach to use modern hardware. We hope this inspires others to implement other algorithms for GPUs to further improve the accuracy of the results.2.We implemented two applications: a Desktop application for individual investigators that want to have timely results on a medium-size data set, and an application targeted at institutions with access to compute clusters with GPUs for very large data sets.3.We provide a detailed discussion of the accuracy of our results.4.We showed high performance and high scalability with our applications that support large databases of images and can scale up independent of the type of GPU supporting compute jungles.5.We offer highly reproducible results. We used an open data set without any form of filtering and all of our software is open source with permanent links to the specific versions used in the form of DOIs.
