We have presented a method for multi-attribute embedding. The method takes qualitative measures and solves an optimization problem that embeds them into multiple spaces such that the quantitative measures in the embedded spaces agree with the qualitative measures. The optimization solves two sets of unknown parameters simultaneously: one is the embedded coordinates of the points and the other is the classification variables of the measure to the unknown attributes. We presented a group optimization and showed its power to infer the attribute classification and produce embedding coordinates. Our experimental results on crowdsourced data demonstrate the competence of our method to produce multi-embedding from inconsistent and redundant data. Our method can also be applied to intuitive image retrieval by turning on and off different attributes.
Limitations. Different similarity attributes may have different popularity, but our method does not take this into account. In addition, the number of different embeddings in our method needs to be manually set. While larger number of embeddings can better reflect more attributes, there is a risk that they actually represent noise or outlier measures. An interesting future work is to try and differentiate inliers and outliers measures, and automatically pick a suitable number of embedding spaces.
Future work. A possible future work is to try and differentiate inliers and outliers measures, and automatically pick a suitable number of embedding spaces. Another interesting future work is to extend our method to sketch based image retrieval (Yu et al., 2016). Since people often emphasize different aspects in sketches, learning multiple similarity embeddings among sketches and real world images may improve the effectiveness of SBIR.
