In this paper, we introduce the networked evolutionary algorithm framework for solving optimization problems. The NEA framework, based on the idea of NITS, improves EA by involving heterogeneity from aspects of the communication network structure and information fusion strategies. We further implement the NEA framework on three representative EAs: GA, PSO and DE. Despite the different details of implementation, all the results show the significant power of NEA on improving the performance of traditional EA.
