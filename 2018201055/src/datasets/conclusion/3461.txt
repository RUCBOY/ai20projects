In this paper we have proposed efficient, completely recursive, and forward stable DST I–IV algorithms, which are defined solely via corresponding matrices DST I–IV sparse, scaled orthogonal, rotational, rotational-reflection, and butterfly matrices, while providing the corresponding arithmetic complexity and forward error bounds of the algorithms. Moreover, the language of signal flow graphs is used to show the connection between algebraic operations used in the DST I–IV matrix factorizations and signal flow graph building blocks, to illustrate the (n−1)-point signal flow graph for DST I and n-point signal flow graphs for DST II–IV.
