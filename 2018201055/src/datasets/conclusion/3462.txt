Non-catalytic upgrading of vacuum residue (VR) was investigated in solution of water and FA in supercritical condition. Considerable impact of coke suppression was observed in comparison with the solution free of FA. It is well known that FA decomposes in parallel by two paths of decarboxylation and dehydration, in which the second path provides a new source of hydrogen in SCW, namely AH, by water-gas shift reaction. The thermodynamic simulations as well as experiments by isotope labeling technique revealed significance of produced AH in SCW upgrading residue. The following results are concluded in this research:
(1)Experimental data verify that Lee-Kessler EoS interaction parameters modified by Plöcker mixing rule (LK-PLOCK) are excellent candidate as an Aspen Plus thermodynamic model for prediction of physico-chemical properties of formic acid in SCW. This model appears suitable for Aspen simulation of many chemical processes in SCW medium, for instance biomass gasification, where the ultimate product is syngas comprised of H2, CH4, CO and CO2.(2)By increasing temperature, coking was suppressed due to the positive influence of the temperature on better miscibility of heavy oil in water (until 450 °C); however, higher temperature would not recommend due to higher rate of polycyclic aromatics' condensation reaction because of coke formation.(3)Operating pressure in the range of 25–27 MPa, as far as we have investigated, is appropriate to render coke formation, because higher pressures would cause negative effects on the miscibility of heavy oil in water and degree of AH formation.(4)Both thermodynamic simulation and experiments illustrate the significant contribution of AH by increasing FA/W ratio. By increasing this ratio, decomposition of FA is shifted toward dehydration (FA → CO + H2O) paving the way for more contribution of water as an AH donor by WGSR (CO + H2O → CO2 + H2).
