TrkA inhibitors are currently considered as potential future treatments for many cancers. The pharmacophoric binding modes of TrkA inhibitors were explored via ten diverse sets of previously known inhibitors. Next, genetic algorithm analysis was employed to reveal the optimal QSAR model capable of explaining anti-TrkA bioactivity variation across 161 collected TrkA inhibitors. A complex QSAR equation was the most successful which indicates the complex and dynamic structure activity relationship among active TrkA inhibitors. The QSAR equation was experimentally validated by the identification of several TrkA inhibitors retrieved via in silico screening, out of which 7 inhibitors illustrated micromolar potencies which represent a step forward to understand the complex nature of the TrkA enzyme and its' interactions with the active inhibitors.
