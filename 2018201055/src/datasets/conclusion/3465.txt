This study is among the first to analyze the information practices of digital humanities scholars. Digging into Data 3 generated new and fruitful knowledge. In developing “one culture,” these scholars capitalize upon work practices previously exploited by scientists. More LIS research will focus on IDR as the latter’s importance and prevalence continues to increase (Palmer, 2017). IDR “has delivered much already and promises more” (National Academy of Sciences, 2004, p. 16). Nonetheless, we have much to learn about how lessons from other IDR projects and DH work such as DID3 can inform one another.
