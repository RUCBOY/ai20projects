Firstly, we highlight that the OS Kernel failures represented only 17.34% of all OS failures observed in our dataset, and the most prevalent OS failures were related to OS services (60.63%). It led us to conclude that software reliability studies, focused on operating systems, should not restrict their analyses to OS Kernel failures, as has been the norm in the literature.Table A.1.

Another finding observed in this work and that can influence empirical studies in this area is related to the sampling strategy. The evidences show that in the analyzed dataset, OS failures presented different occurrence patterns according to the period of the day. In general, most OS failures occurred in the afternoon; OS Kernel failures occurred more often in the evening, while OS Application failures were predominant in the morning and OS Service failures in the afternoon. Thus, collecting OS failures only in a given period of the day may not cover all failure categories equally.
We also found that failures in the Windows Update Service (WUS) were predominant among the OS services failures, which means that software update malfunctioning has a high impact on the OS reliability.
Given the diversity of the groups evaluated in this study, and the number of pattern candidates detected, such evidences strengthen our conclusion that the detected combinations of OS failure events listed in Table 10, Table 8, Table 9 are genuine failure patterns (FPs). In total, we found 45 failure patterns with 153,511 occurrences.
Based on these failure patterns, whose failures that occurred before and after a reference failure had the same type/subtype of the reference failure itself, especially for the configurations PFE→RF and RF→NFE. We conclude that certain OS components fail in a time-correlated manner, an important property to be considered in software reliability modeling.

Table 12, which shows the rankings of the PFE→RF→NFE configuration, has Windows Update (WinU) as the reference failure in the top five failure pattern candidates, in all rankings; note that WinU was present in all rankings of the two other FPC configurations. In all rankings, WinU always occurred together with other WUS subtypes. These findings suggest that failures in updating Win7 OS components have a clear correlation with failures of other software components.
Moreover, we found that all WUS failure subtypes composed FPCs with other subtypes of failures or with the same WUS failure subtypes. This indicates that failures in the Windows Update Service can cause failures in all updates being performed by this service or even cause failures on the same software update, repeatedly. In this case, there is a clear autocorrelation between the same WUS failure subtypes.
Examining the most frequent failure causes in the failure patterns discovered, we conclude that most of these failures were closely related to external factors upon which the WUS depends, such as disk space and RPC service. Thus, preventive management of these factors focused on their higher availability is a possible action to improve the Win7 reliability.
Finally, plans for future work include:

•Broadening the search intervals to longer periods such as 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h;•Increasing the size and diversity of the dataset to verify whether the consistency of the failure patterns observed in this study is maintained;•Investigating failures that presented autocorrelation, analyzing whether these failures are the consequence of malfunctioning of the same OS component, occurring multiple times sequentially, or whether they are the result of simultaneous failures of multiple instances of the same OS component running concurrently;•Study in more detail the nature of the different failure correlations observed among the OS failure patterns discovered in this study, aiming to verify possible causality relationships between their failures; particularly between failures of software updates and FPCs that follow the configuration PFE→RF→NFE, since we observed more occurrences of these cases.
