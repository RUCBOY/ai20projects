Data security is one of the most concerned about cloud users, but also a key step in restricting the development of the cloud storage technology. In our scheme, through the combination of lattice signature and Bloom Filter theory, not only to achieve the resistance of quantum computer [19] attacks, and because the Lattice and Bloom Filter are operated in the vector space, thereby enhancing the cloud storage space utilization. With the increasing number of data in cloud storage, how to make more efficient use of cloud storage space, how to protect the user's privacy under the premise of improving the efficiency of TPA verification, will be our next step. From the current view, cloud storage data security issues still have great research value and a very broad space for development. If we can explore these issues in depth, I believe it will be better to promote the development of cloud storage platform and make cryptography system more perfect.
