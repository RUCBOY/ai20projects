The bounds that we have given for chordal graphs and distance-hereditary graphs are tight. While we can hope to improve the other upper bounds of this paper, we conjecture that they exceed 3n∕3. It can be observed that for some more narrow classes of graphs of bounded chordality, the number of minimal connected vertex covers becomes polynomial.

Proposition 2The number of minimal connected vertex covers of a split graph
G is at most
n, and these can be enumerated in time
O(n+m). The number of minimal connected vertex covers of a cobipartite graph
G is at most
n2∕4+n, and these can be enumerated in time
O(n3).


ProofNotice that if X is a clique of a graph G, then for every vertex cover U of G, either X⊆U or |X∖U|=1. Let G be a split graph. Without loss of generality we can assume that G is a connected graph with at least two vertices. Let K,I be a partition of V(G)
 into a clique K and an independent set I and assume that K is an inclusion maximal clique of G. If V(G)=K, then G has n minimal connected vertex covers K∖{v} for v∈V(G) that can be listed in time O(m). Assume that I≠∅. Then K is a connected vertex cover of G. For v∈K, if U is a minimal connected vertex cover of G with v⁄∈U, U=(K∖{v})∪NG(v) and |U|=dG(v)+1. It immediately implies that G has at most n connected vertex covers and they can be listed in time O(n+m). Taking into account that a partition K,I can be found in time O(n+m), it follows that the minimal connected vertex covers can be enumerated in time O(n+m).Let now G be a cobipartite graph. Again, we can assume without loss of generality that G is a connected graph with at least two vertices. If G is a complete graph, then G has n connected vertex covers. Assume that G is not a complete graph, and let K1,K2 be a partition of V(G) into two cliques. Let U be a minimal connected vertex cover of G. If K1⊆U, then U=V(G)∖{v} for v∈K2, and there are at most |K2| sets of this type. Symmetrically, there are at most |K1| minimal connected vertex covers U with K2⊆U. If K1∖U≠∅ and K2∖U≠∅, then U=V(G)∖{u,v} for u∈K1 and v∈K2, and G has at most |K1||K2| such minimal connected vertex covers. We conclude that G has at most |K1|+|K2|+|K1||K2|≤n2∕4+n minimal connected vertex covers. Taking into account that any connected vertex covers has at most n−1 vertices, these arguments can be applied to obtain an enumeration algorithm that runs in time O(n3).  □

Finally let us consider a related combinatorial question. What is the relation of the maximum number of minimal vertex covers and the maximum number of minimal connected vertex covers? More precisely, is there a particular class of connected graphs for which the difference of both numbers is exponential in n? Trees provide an easy answer. On one hand, every tree has a unique minimal connected vertex cover consisting of all its cut vertices. On the other hand, there are trees with at least 2n−12 minimal vertex covers; e.g. a union of K2’s with an additional vertex adjacent to exactly one vertex of each K2. Hence there are trees on n vertices having one minimal connected vertex cover but their number of minimal vertex covers is exponential in n.
It is more interesting to observe that the number of minimal connected vertex covers of a connected graph may be significantly larger than its number of minimal vertex covers. Consider the graphs Gk, k≥1 integer, constructed as follows.



•
The vertex set of Gk consists of Ai={ai,bi,ci,di,ei} for all i=1,2,…,k and xi for all i=1,2,…,k+1. Thus Gk has n=6k+1 and G1 has 7 vertices.
•
For all i=2,…,k, vertex xi is adjacent in Gk to all vertices of Ai−1∪Ai, x1 is adjacent to all vertices of A1 and xk+1 is adjacent to all vertices of Ak.
