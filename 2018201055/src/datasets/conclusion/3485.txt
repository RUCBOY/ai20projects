Overall, we consider the experience of conducting the course “Supercomputing Simulation and Technologies” as an absolutely positive one. The 146 algorithm descriptions obtained as a result of implementing the assignment are of great value and describe the proposed algorithms with very high quality and accuracy. Indeed, obtaining good results required major effort from both students and teachers. But it was worth it! The students had to use the knowledge and skills obtained earlier from other courses, what perfectly brings them to the end of the education process in the magistracy. It should be noted that the assignments can easily be modified to reflect the specifics of the education process at other faculties or universities: a different set of algorithms; focus on studying other properties; the students can be tasked with building their own implementation or they can be given ready source codes with an emphasis on studying scalability properties, etc.
The difference from other courses on HPC-supercomputing is a strong emphasis on the most critical properties of parallel algorithms which are critically important for developing efficient applications for any parallel computing platforms. The main contribution of the paper is twofold: we draw attention to the importance of study of a wide set of parallel algorithms properties and provide a practical methodology to reach this goal.
The course implemented in 2016 can be considered a pilot. At the same time, the experience of teaching supercomputer modeling, presented in the paper, for students specializing in the field of Computational Sciences can be regarded as an important milestone on the road to exascale. Given the positive results achieved, we are planning to expand the topics covered during the lecture part of the course, taking such areas as climate changes modeling on supercomputers, high-performance image processing, supercomputing drug design and deep learning.
