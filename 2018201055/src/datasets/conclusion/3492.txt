A new open-source software for strong ground motion data processing called OpenSeismoMatlab is presented, which uses advanced time integration algorithms, contains open and free source code written in MATLAB, and uses an accurate formulation and implementation of the elastoplastic bilinear kinematic hardening constitutive model. Parts of the code have been presented and explained in detail in this paper, so that the reader can easily understand the structure and implementation of the software and make various case-dependent adjustments in order to obtain results of the highest quality. The various types of spectra of 11 earthquake strong ground motions have been extracted with OpenSeismoMatlab and it has been shown that they are nearly identical to corresponding results of SeismoSignal, a reliable commercial proprietary software. In some cases, the quality of the results of the new software is superior to that of SeismoSignal due to the fact that it uses advanced time integration algorithms that allow for controlled dissipation, dispersion and overshooting properties. A numerical investigation was made which showed that OpenSeismoMatlab provides more accurate results than SeismoSignal when the same integration step size is used for both. OpenSeismoMatlab is a unique software that combines innovative numerical algorithms, high quality and robustness and is provided as an open-source tool to the research and professional engineering communities for the seismic design of structures as well as the processing of strong ground motions. The new software can be used for free by students and/or programmers for the seismic design of structures as well as general processing of strong ground motions. Thanks to its open source nature, it can be of high educational value for related university courses and can be easily extended or modified in order to be incorporated in higher level software.
