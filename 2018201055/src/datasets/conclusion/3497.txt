The damage index is an indicator factor allowing the quantification of damage through different degradation signs, and by implementing visual inspection data collected previously on a pipeline element. The developed ones within the presented system aim to exclude the engineer's subjectivity to determine path of pipelines requiring prioritized intervention during the assessment operation. Therefore, this is made possible by intensifying the evaluation of every phenomenon with exhaustive classification. However, the given factors such as, extensive pit index (IP), corrosion crater index (ICr), weight loss (IUnif), or cracking index (IF), it becomes feasible to objectively confront the whole damage parameters of the pipeline. Indeed, the methodology developed herein is mainly based on a calculation approach by using rational varied parameters in order to classify them in homogenous way. However, the model's sensitivity being verified and requires the use of the damage index which is executed with necessary precautions. In the same context, the diverse parameters presented should probably adjusted in order to better enhance and refine the system, while the damage index seems to be a useful tool and mainly serves to guide not impose or fix decisions of the engineer in charge of inspections. Finally, in our knowledge, it could be tempting to adopt the verdict that proceeds from an advanced technology system but keep in mind that no tool or methodology of this nature can outdo the final judgment of human arguments.
