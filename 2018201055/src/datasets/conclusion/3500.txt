Considering the results of this study, it can be concluded that Turkish pre-service science teachers' SEBs had an effect on their COTL. Therefore, in guiding pre-service teachers to hold more constructivist COTL, educators should find ways to support their epistemological sophistication. Argumentation may be a qualified candidate for this purpose. Second, pre-service teachers' COTL contribute more positively to their digital literacy skills if they hold constructivist COTL. For this reason, we suggest that future teachers holding constructivist COTL will make use of digital tools in their classes in a more effective manner and will be able to adapt to future developments in ICT. Science teaching method courses and other courses can particularly be used to support their constructivist conceptions. Third, it can be concluded that pre-service science teachers' previous experiences impact their beliefs and digital literacy skills. For this reason, science teacher education curricula should be reviewed to provide students with more positive experiences regarding constructivist COTL and digital literacy qualifications. Furthermore, students should gain positive experiences concerning digital technologies even in primary or secondary schools. Digital literacy, which is one of the most important 21st century skills, can be more effectively supported if teacher education programs consider pre-service science teachers' belief systems. This study produced critical findings regarding this relationship.
