The paper presented the integration of Temporal Logic within a framework for safety supervisory control. The framework and analytical tools here developed are meant to guide safety intervention both online and offline, and to dynamically support in real-time operator's situational awareness and decision-making regarding emerging hazardous situations. A proof-of-concept case study was presented to showcase the insights that can be derived from the use of the proposed integrated framework.
On a general level, we highlighted several advantages from the adoption of TL in conjunction with the model-based framework we set up. Those included:

•The use of TL allowed more complex expressions of the hazard level that include temporal operators. Explicit considerations of ordering and timing of events, faults, or sequence of states can thus be accounted for in the definition of H(t) itself. This provides significant benefits and flexibility for expressing complex conditions or situations in a compact form;•The expression of TL safety properties is independent of the specific hazards functions H(t) of interest. While hazard functions are specialized and tailored to particular contexts, the TL safety properties are general and agnostic to the underlying system. They can be conceived of as elements within a universal library of safety properties to be applied for the analysis of any dynamical system;•By leveraging a language that is typical of software systems, our approach allows the integration of both software and hardware components within the same framework and towards dynamic risk assessment. As such, temporal logic can serve as a bridge between the risk/safety community and the computer science community. The adoption of TL can also help reduce miscommunications that occur at the interface between the two engineering disciplines of risk/safety and software engineering [14], and it can provide a common semantic model for terms used in safety analysis and in software requirements.
On a particular level, the application of the proposed framework to the case study enabled us to uncover important findings beyond those proposed in the official accident investigation report. Those included:

•The analysis of the fail-safe safety principle helped understand an important condition predicated on airspeed thresholds needed to “debug” spurious AIR mode signals from the squat switches. By augmenting the flawed FADEC logic with a check for such condition it is possible to prevent the FADEC from wrongly estimating that the aircraft is in AIR mode, and remove a lurking accident pathogen from the system.•We devised a danger index in support of online pilots’ decision-making for rejecting a takeoff. This index depends on the distance necessary to bring the aircraft to a full stop and accounts for a region beyond the end of the runway, and before obstacles are encountered, to be used as safety area. Mappings for best-case and worst-case scenarios (depending on how compromised the aircraft performance/ braking capabilities are) would have informed the pilots of the Learjet and advised against RTO initiation.•We identified important violations of the OID principle during the Learjet accident sequence, which contributed to a degraded situational awareness on the part of the pilots. To counteract such violations, we examined the importance of setting up consistency checks among different evaluations of the hazard level captured at different subsystem nodes/interfaces, for instance comparing the system output resulting by two sets of inputs: those provided by the pilots in the cockpit and that reflected the intent of the pilots in terms of expected behavior, and those re-handled and executed by the FADEC subsystem.
A final consideration regards the truthfully probabilistic nature of the phenomena considered in this work. While we presented a proof-of-concept application within the deterministic domain, the hazard level is in fact a random variable, and the presented framework can be augmented to account for a probabilistic side. For instance, Eq. (3) showed a simple first order deterministic expression for the estimation of the time-to-accident variable. More elaborate estimators can be devised to account for the persistency of increase in H(t) as well as its slope and other dynamic features. Furthermore, when the estimate is conducted repeatedly over time, a probability density function of ∆TAi can be obtained, as shown in Fig. 15. Several uses can be made of this random variable and its features to inform safety-related decision-making, for example the shrinking of its standard deviation would reflect an increasing certainty of an impending accident (should business-as-usual in the operation of the system be maintained, or no safety intervention triggered). The authors are currently exploring the probabilistic extension of the presented framework.Download : Download high-res image (50KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 15.
