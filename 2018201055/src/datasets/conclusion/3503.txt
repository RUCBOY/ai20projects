In summary, findings from this study suggested a unique relationship between science readiness and approaches to learning. Theory suggests science experiences provide children opportunities to practice their approaches to learning, and approaches to learning aids children in navigating science experiences. Results from this study represent a first step in providing empirical evidence for this symbiotic relationship. Science is an ideal context for teachers to capitalize on the bidirectional relationship between these two critical readiness domains. While the importance of science education is nationally recognized, there is an urgent need to improve the infrastructure of science education in the United States. Promoting preschool science is a necessary starting point. In this endeavor, science-based curricula should be developed and disseminated to capitalize on the relationship between science and approaches to learning, which could have profound implications for narrowing the school readiness achievement gap.
