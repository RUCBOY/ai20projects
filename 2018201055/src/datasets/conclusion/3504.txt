For multivariate time series (MTS) classification, a new distance measure named dynamic time warping algorithm based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS-DTW) is introduced in this paper. It is a generalized dynamic time warping algorithm, and due to the benefit of DTW and HFS, optimal alignment between time instance segments is found. The pre-processing skills of data sets were investigated, and a combined method is preferred according to the results. We tested the proposed algorithm using 1NN classification with MTS data sets; several state-of-the-art algorithms were compared. And the exhaustive method was conducted with different scale parameters, illustrating the distribution of error rates and time-consuming. Some advice about how to use the HFS-DTW efficiently is given in the end.
The experiment results show that the proposed method performs better on accuracy than other state-of-the-art algorithms, and in the worst condition, it is reduced to the original DTW. The time-consuming tests show that HFS-DTW is affected by the length of time series, but it gets a better performance when the scale parameters are set optimal. To sum up, the HFS-DTW is a preferable algorithm, which could balance the higher accuracy and lower time-consuming.
From the above results, there are several potential directions for further research. The type of data sets has an impact on the time-consuming, finding which type of data set is capable for HFS-DTW is our next target. Also, the parameters of the proposed method are set empirically; adjusting parameters should be added in our method. At last, there must be a better pre-processing method mapping data to [0, 1], it is worth to put more efforts to seek it.
