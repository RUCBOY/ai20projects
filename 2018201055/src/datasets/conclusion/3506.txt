Nevertheless, for people without access to the computer program, the conventional numerical analysis may be inconvenient.(2)A commonly used model is considered where the methane adsorption is described by the Langmuir isotherm and the free gas is treated as real gas. By introducing the similarity transformations, the model is reduced into an ordinary equation, of which the solutions are the similarity solutions of the original model.(3)For the case where the free gas is ignored, there are only two model parameters left in the similarity model. Based on the similarity solution sets tabulated or graphed in advance for such case, a method is proposed to solve the commonly used model.(4)Since only algebraic manipulations are involved, the proposed method is simple and can be done on a hand calculator.(5)Two examples are introduced to test the accuracy of the proposed method. One is a real field case example, and another is a fictitious extreme example. It is shown that the gas pressure profile obtained by the proposed method agrees well with the direct numerical solution.
