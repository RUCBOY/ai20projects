Many water-intensive industries such as semiconductors and related high-tech industries are increasingly more conscious about the risks of water shortage to the corporate sustainability and thus have been proactively pursuing options to secure water resources. Regenerating spent water from processes has become an important option to achieve this goal. Using Taiwan's SIP – an agglomerate of companies forming either vertical or horizontal integration in the supply chain of a wide array of microelectronic devices – as an example, we revisited the progress made in water consumption efficiency of the industries in the most recent years. Regulatory mandates aside, companies are also careful with the overall cost-benefit of the investment into gaining in-plant regenerated water as an alternative water resource. One of the major cost components is the energy involved in the purification system of spent water for reuses. While this water-energy linkage for the industry-specific perspective is still in its early stage of the investigation, companies are willing to explore options that venture beyond individual fabs, which in itself is an important milestone because sharing information between competing fabs had never been in the culture of the industry. Fabs mostly viewed these options, including an inter-plants scenario and an inter-park scenario, with positive responses regarding gaining overall cost and energy benefit. The risks of reclaimed water quality, especially those involving reuses as source water for UPW, and the relative costs of tap water and reclaimed water are the two primary considerations for these fabs in their decision-making.
