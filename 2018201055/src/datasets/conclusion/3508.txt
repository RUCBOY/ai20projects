In this paper we have introduced m-dimensional distorted probabilities on random vectors for continuous domains. We have given some results to characterize their construction and provided some examples. We have also related them to hierarchically decomposable fuzzy measures, and defined hierarchically decomposable fuzzy measures on continuous domains, as a subtype of m-dimensional distorted probabilities. Our definition is based on our previous definition for finite domains. Nevertheless, note that our characterization of the function f is only applicable to the continuous case. Otherwise, the domain and the range of f are finite.
The application of fuzzy measures to real problems needs families of measures that are easy to define. To this end, a large number of families exist on discrete domains but this is not the case for continuous ones. Distorted probabilities are probably the only such family.
In this work we have contributed with two families that naturally extend distorted probabilities and make the use of fuzzy measures easier. These results apply to fuzzy measures defined to pairs of (or in general, to the product of t) random variables.
As stated in the introduction the usefulness of our approach is partially based on the understanding that there are already parametric distributions on continuous domains and, therefore, they can be used to define fuzzy measures.
Future work includes further results on these types of m-dimensional distorted probability measures, the definition of other families of transformed-probability measures, and the extension to functions related to probability distributions such as the cumulative distribution function, the survival function or the characteristic function. We also aim at development of software to compute efficiently the Choquet integral of functions with respect to these families of measures, in the line ofÂ [13].
