This paper presents a novel hybrid lung segmentation method that combines the agility of the statistical-based region growing with the precision of the adaptive graph cut. In the proposed method, the seed regions are extracted automatically using the intelligent block-based binarization from the enhanced chest radiographs with steep contrast ratio. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed method achieves higher segmentation accuracy with lower computational cost when compared with the other state-of-the-art methods. Another extension of the proposed framework relies on the utilization of parallelism on the statistical-based region growing for expediting the implementation complexity and further experimental validation of the proposed method. Furthermore, another future direction of this study is to exploit and observe the computational power of embedded system in implementing the proposed method toward a fully-automatic CAD-based solution on CXR images for detecting certain abnormalities.
