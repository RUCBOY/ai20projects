The paper has proposed a pulmonary nodules computer aided diagnosis algorithm based on ELM. First, it has established the pulmonary nodules Haralick feature model based on the pulmonary nodules regions of lung CT images. Then, input the feature sets into ELM and get the results for computer aided diagnosis, which solved the problem of pulmonary nodules computer aided diagnosis algorithm based on SVM that the training time is very long while the testing accuracy is relatively low. After that, a pulmonary nodules computer aided diagnose algorithm based on SS-ELM is proposed, which input both certain class feature sets as well as the unlabeled feature sets into SS-ELM for training and get the results for computer aided diagnosis. It solved the problem of unlabeled data learning. Finally, the effective of the algorithms has been proved by experiments which used 1018 sets of thoracic CT images from LIDC-IDRI. The results have shown that, compared with SVM, the pulmonary nodules CAD based on ELM has an obvious advantage in training time and accuracy. Compared with ELM, the pulmonary nodules CAD based on SS-ELM have better accuracy performance.
