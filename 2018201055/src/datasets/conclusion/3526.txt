In this paper, we formulated saliency detection into salient object segmentation task under image-to-image translation framework. Saliency maps were generated by training an improved cGAN model. Experimental results showed that the trained cGAN model with the Wasserstein distance and L1 loss can achieve promising performance on six benchmark datasets by comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we explored the potential of our model on generating images from saliency maps, which can be applied to sensing the circumstance associated with a certain salient object. Experimental results demonstrated that the trained cGANw model can generate reasonable saliency-to-context relationships from saliency masks based on categorized image data.
