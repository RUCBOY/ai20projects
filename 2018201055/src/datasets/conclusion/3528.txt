In this paper, we proposed a ECC-based smart healthcare system. This system realized the cognition of data and resource, and solved the problems of inflexible network resource deployment. Specifically, the system first monitored and analyzed the physical health of the smart-clothing users in view of the edge cognitive computing architecture and relevant technologies. Then, based on the data-driven approach, the system implemented a reasonable allocation of edge computing resources. The experimental results showed that the proposed ECC-based healthcare system offered a better user QoE in an emergency case, while the computing resources were reasonably optimized. In the future, we will build an emotional recognition system based on ECC. With this emotional detection system, usersâ€™ emotion will be recognized, and corresponding care will be carried out.
