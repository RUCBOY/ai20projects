In this paper, we evaluated the dependability of SISO control-theoretic power managers and presented guidelines for system designer on how to properly model their system and verify the performance of the designed controller. The growing significance of power and thermal issues in these system calls for robust power capping schemes that provide guarantees on the systemâ€™s efficiency and dependability. One of the viable solutions to this issue is the use of control-theoretic methods with formal guarantees. We showed that in the design phase of the existing power managers, system identification and controller performance analysis phases are often neglected. In this work, we took a closer look at issues that might arise from these two steps and provided guidelines to designers on how to design and deploy more reliable controllers. Our evaluations include power capping methods for both single-core and multi-core processors. Moreover, an in-depth analysis has been performed on multiple controller configurations using SPLASH2 and PARSEC benchmark suites.
