Mobile video accounts for the greatest proportion of mobile network services, and this proportion is continuing to grow. Mobile networks are heterogeneous wireless network environments and frequent network status changes occur. For mobile video services in the wireless network, it is important to satisfy the bandwidth required by the video player of a mobile terminal. In general, mobile terminals manage traffic for mobile video using the video player buffer. They request data blocks for the mobile video from a content server on the Internet. However, to improve QoS for mobile video services and QoE for mobile video users, a network architecture capable of quickly responding to changes in the access network and traffic management for the network architecture are required. Therefore, a network architecture integrated with the mobile edge cloud, and traffic management using the mobile edge cloud, are proposed. In the proposed method, the MEC server in the mobile edge cloud maintains the media buffer and controls video traffic in the media buffer according to the access network status. The mobile terminal can reduce transmission delay by requesting video traffic from the mobile edge cloud instead of the Internet cloud. This can quickly fill the video player buffer of the mobile video player, thereby maintaining mobile video quality of service.
