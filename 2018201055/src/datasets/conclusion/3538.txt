This paper proposes DD-Graph, a distributed disk-based graph-processing framework, to support very large scale graph computing jobs. DD-Graph is cost-effective and of high-performance. By scheduling the tasks of a graph-computing job on several compute nodes, DD-Graph is capable of processing very large graphs on a small cluster while achieving the high performance of existing distributed in-memory graph-processing frameworks. Extensive prototype evaluation of DD-Graph, driven by very large graph datasets, indicates that the cost-effective advantage of DD-Graph makes it notably superior to the existing distributed graph-processing frameworks, particularly when processing the very large graphs. For example, DD-Graph saves 73% of GPSâ€™ hardware costs while running 1.34x faster than GPS.
