This research concludes that the smart cities traffic controlling mechanism perform better and efficient performance by using the video camera instead of the sensors. The video is initially processed on Raspberry Pi 3 and then for the further processing sent on cloud server using the IoT connectivity and green transmission protocols. The result performance depicts the proposed framework is effective for the energy consumption and processing perspective. The video size is reduced from MBs to KBs for the transmission purposes and also for the analytics. The Effective of the proposed solution and in the reduction of the transmission of data load at the network and effective object recognitions presented. The Internet of Thing devices used for the data acquisition and cloud computing used for the instantaneous decision making. Using cloud computing. Three types of videos with 12 low-quality videos having size range of 36–99 MB, 9 normal quality videos with size range is 100–180 MB, and 9 high-quality videos with size range is 180–448 MB are analyzed. The priority vehicle identification is a critical task that is done over the cloud by using the Internet of Thing Transmission protocol and standards. In future, this framework could be enhanced to communicate b/w multiple server devices for a better traffic handling. The algorithm in camera devices can also be improved for use in accident detection. Furthermore, this framework can also be used for traffic rules violation. Through using green transmission efficiency of the system is efficiently increased. This framework can in future be used for vehicular tracking. Message Queue Telemetry Transport is utilized in this system which is battered then another system also most suitable for the proposed system. It is used to transmit data between server and client, may replace in future some more appropriate protocols.
