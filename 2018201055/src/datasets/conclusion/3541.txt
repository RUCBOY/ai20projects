This paper proposes a new multi-layer graph based diffusion (MLD) model for image saliency detection problem. The aim of the proposed model is to derive a more reasonable cues for both background and foreground measurements, respectively by adopting RWR model, which can thus lead to more accurate saliency estimation. Experimental results on four benchmark databases show the better performance of the proposed method. In the future, we will apply our model to some other computer vision problems, such as video saliency, image co-segmentation, etc.
