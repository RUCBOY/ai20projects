In this paper, we proposed a method of feature recognition based on improved NBA algorithm. By using the self-learning habit and good extensibility of the neural network, the feature recognition range of the network is increased; Based on graph decomposition and feature factors clustering can recognize a series of composite features. Compared with the traditional method, this method improves the accuracy of feature recognition and the recognition ability of complex features.
