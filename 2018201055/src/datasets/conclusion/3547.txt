Network reconstruction is a problem of great interest which belongs to multiple domains, for example, biology, genetics, social networking, epidemic and wireless sensor network. In this paper, we presented a simple yet efficient approach to infer the connection matrix from the given binary time series data of a process held over the considered network and also compared with a CST based method for the same. From the considered diffusion dynamics under SIS model, a matrix, M, is generated using the status-time-series data that is converted to the connection matrix on the basis of a simple observation made on the entries of the matrix M. Reconstruction procedure has novelty in accuracy and efficiency. The proposed method can be applied in more general contact based diffusion dynamics without prior information of the nodal dynamics. Network topology inference framework can be utilized in link prediction also. Missing links can be identified using the proposed method. In future, the proposed framework can be extended to identify missing nodes as well as links with their meaningful attributes.
