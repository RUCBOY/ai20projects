In this work, we address the problem of outlier detection in high-dimensional image datasets. We combine autoencoder with Adaboost to capture the statistical correlations among normal dataâ€™s features. Moreover, we introduce the Sparse Group Lasso constraint to every autoencoder in order to obtain a compact model. We propose Adagrad Proximal Gradient Descent to optimize the new training objective, and utilize Pareto-based learning framework to obtain the best penalty factors of SGL. By evaluating on several image datasets, our proposed detection algorithm not only has a compact detection model, but can also detect the image outliers efficiently.
