We have developed two computer simulation environments for the delivery of physics education in radiological science in a practical and engaging way. This new innovative method of delivery provides an opportunity for experiential learning to a wide range of radiography, radiology and medical physics students across our institution. Our approach has enabled students to develop an understanding of the physical principles that are applied to practical situations without the need to access the clinical environment at this stage in their education.
