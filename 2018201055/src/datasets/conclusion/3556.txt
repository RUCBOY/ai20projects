In this paper, we have reviewed the automatic BUS image segmentation approaches. A general comparison between the categories of BUS image segmentation approaches is listed in Table 6. The major future directions of BUS image segmentation are summarized as follows:Table 6.

Unconstrained BUS image segmentation techniques: currently, most BUS image segmentation approaches work well on BUS images collected in controlled settings such as high image contrast, less artifacts, containing only one tumor per image, etc. However, their performance degrades greatly with BUS images having large variations in image quality, degree and location of artifacts, and number of tumors per image. Therefore, to promote the application of BUS CAD systems in clinical practice, it is crucial to develop unconstrained BUS segmentation techniques which are invariant to image settings. Potential directions are to learn invariant and discriminative representations of tumors in BUS images, and to model human vision mechanism [110], [154], [176].
Benchmark: a publicly accessible BUS image benchmark can be useful for comparing existing approaches, for discovering novel strategies that can contribute to better segmentation performance, for helping researchers to develop better approaches, and for promoting the development and advance of breast cancer research. Building of a publicly accessible BUS image dataset requires incredible effort (many years of hard work, and large amount of resources); however, its impact will be significant and profound.
Deep learning: in the last several years, deep learning has demonstrated impressive performance for many tasks such as object recognition [158], image classification [159], semantic segmentation [160], facial expression recognition [163], speech recognition [164], medical applications [161], [170], etc. Deep learning models have great potential to achieve good performance for BUS image segmentation because of their ability to learn compact image representation using sufficiently large BUS image dataset.
High performance segmentation: segmentation performance is usually evaluated by memory cost, speed, and accuracy. Currently, many BUS image segmentation approaches are computation and memory intensive, which limits their widespread applications. For example, it is difficult to integrate resource-intensive algorithms into portable BUS devices for real time applications. In some resource-limited regions or countries, many lives were lost because of unavailability of accurate and low-cost breast cancer detection techniques and devices; high performance approaches consume much less resources than traditional approaches, and is vitally important to provide an affordable means for early detection of breast cancer.
In addition, we have tried to collect codes or software for BUS image segmentation in the public domain; however, we could not find any yet. It may be a future task for the research society.
