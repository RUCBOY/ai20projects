In this paper, we have presented BPARES a novel balanced parallel algorithm for mining frequent itemsets from SNP datasets without candidate generation. BPARES exploits (i) an automatic workload balancing algorithm to improve the performance and (ii) two novel data structures named TDB and FLIST to support the FP-Tree building for fast counting the support of items as well as to prune the search space. In this way, BPARES is also able to mine frequent itemsets reducing the effort required for search space exploration, support counting, and search space pruning. Experimental studies with synthetic SNP datasets show that BPARES can reach the same performance of is predecessor PARES in terms of mined frequent itemsets by using lower computational power thanks to the automatic workload balancing strategy. Moreover, the automatic workload balancing allows BPARES to have a good scalability as well as to limit the memory consumption within a fixed memory size that is proportional to the dimension of the analyzed SNP dataset. Future works will focus on developing methodologies to make BPARES compatible with new high-resolution genomics data obtained through high-throughput technologies. This extension would provide an alternative way to face high-resolution genomics data which are characterized by a very massive amount of data. An additional extension could regard the porting of BPARES on a cloud infrastructure, or the implementation of BPARES as a distributed peer-to-peer (P2P) model, making it even more scalable.
