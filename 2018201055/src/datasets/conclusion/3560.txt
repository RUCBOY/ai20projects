In this work, a scalable real time health status prediction system was built around open source big data processing engine, the Apache Spark, tested and deployed on cloud, in which machine learning model is applied on streaming data. The system receives relevant health data of the user through tweet streams and predicts the health status by applying decision tree model on the data and sends a direct message to the user regarding his health status. Thus with a single tweet, a user receives information about his health status instantly and privately, based on which he can decide on whether to seek expert health care or not. The work offers hassle free real time remote health monitoring to users at the convenience of their personal space at no extra cost.
It saves considerable amount of time and money in using existing technologies to its full potential than developing new ones to do the same job. With slight modification, this application can be used to predict the presence of a variety of diseases. As a future work, this application can be linked with the systems of healthcare providers to form a complete real time health care system.
