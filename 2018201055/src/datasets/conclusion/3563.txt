In this paper, a new network immunization strategy is proposed by considering the effect of activities of nodes on a propagation process. Through combining the topological features of networks with activities of nodes, a new metric AR is used to estimate the importance of a node. The immunized nodes, selected based on the value of AR, can effectively restrain the virus propagation. Some experiments in benchmark and synthetic networks show that the proposed method can improve the performance of existing immunization strategy effectively. However, our proposed method should be cooperated and incorporated with existing metrics, which limits its application in large and dynamic networks. In future, we will focus on the effect of activities of nodes on distributed network immunization strategies.
