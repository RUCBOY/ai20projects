Forensic interpretation is an information science [40]. The computer can organize a sample space of possible outcomes, describe the prior probability of each outcome, and compute the outcome's posterior probability from available evidence data. Constructing probability spaces and random variables from these elements provides a detailed match strength analysis of an evidence item. All reference outcomes are accounted for, so no comparison reference is needed at this pre-match stage. The match strength distributions are useful for quantifying potential identification information, preparing database searches, assessing data or methods, performing validation studies, and calculating LR error.
All forensic information should be extracted from evidence data. In the DNA mixture example, the minor contributor contained five cells, with all non-overlapping peaks having low heights under 50 RFU. Crime labs typically discard such DNA data as uninterpretable, inconclusive, too low, or too complex. They do not use the evidence for database searches or match comparisons. Yet the match strength RV distributions were informative. Eventual comparison with the true contributor reference gave a match statistic of 536 thousand. That level of DNA association could help convict or acquit a defendant.
The mathematical probability framework led to efficient algorithms for constructing match strength distributions and calculating LR error. The independence of additive locus RVs permitted rapid and accurate joint RV construction by convolution. The sample space contained exponentially many multi-locus genotypes. The match strength RV mapped these multi-dimensional outcomes into uni-dimensional numbers, collecting and preserving match information in quadratic time.
The convolution approach numerically constructs an exact match strength distribution at a given bin resolution. Independently, a Monte Carlo construction randomly samples genotypes from the underlying probability distribution. A statistical test for distribution equality can compare a convolved cdf with a sampled empirical cdf. For M3's minor genotype, comparing convolved and sampled (N = 10,000) non-contributor distributions gave a Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic [41] of 0.0090 (p = 0.3863), supporting cdf equality. Distribution comparison jointly assesses convolution and sampling methods, mutually validating their accuracy.
The match strength RV approach is quite general. While genotypes have a discrete representation, other variables (e.g., glass index of refraction) are continuous. The RV distribution approach extends to continuous variables and any dimensionality, with integration replacing summation [12]. LR associations are used in fields beyond forensic science, for example, in artificial intelligence [42], medical diagnosis [43] and legal reasoning [44]. Rapid construction of match strength distributions may offer insights, applications and efficiencies in handling uncertainty in such areas.
Uncertainty is prevalent in the natural and social sciences. Bayesian probability modeling helps extract information from real world data to harness that uncertainty [45]. Advance knowledge of the full range of possible outcomes aids decision-making, whether in forensic biology or diagnostic medicine. This paper showed how probabilistic RV analysis can preserve and use identification information, even when the evidence data are thought to be uninterpretable and no reference is available for comparison.
