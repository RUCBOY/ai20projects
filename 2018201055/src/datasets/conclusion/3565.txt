The main contribution of the present study is its support for Tsai and Chai’s (2012) proposal of a third-order barrier to technology integration concerned with teachers' creative and contextual understanding of computing features in relation to classroom learning objectives. Known as ‘design thinking’, the present study found that tackling third-order barrier holds promise for teachers' intentions to use computers in their classrooms.
Our findings also indicate that computer comfort stands out as an especially important second-order barrier in cases where first-order barriers are high. The results suggest that future interventions should focus on improving teachers' comfort levels with a variety of computing features. Furthermore, the findings suggest that guiding teachers through the curriculum design process and giving them the opportunity to create their own lesson plans may stimulate the ‘design thinking’ and computer feature comfort necessary for successful classroom computing integration.
