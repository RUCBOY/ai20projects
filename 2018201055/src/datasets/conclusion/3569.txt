This paper offered an empirical study on Chinese sentiment analysis by convolution neural network. Considering word connection in phrase and sentence, we designed parallel convolution with different kernel sizes and developed a construct called convolution control block. Our CCB based model captures short and long context dependencies. It is evaluated by use of the Million Chinese Hotel Review dataset. The results show that our model is the best compared to LR_all and DCN models. The experimental results also show that the model depth, the sentence length, and the gate convolution are related to the accuracy of sentiment classification, of guidance to model configuration. Our model is of practical value in comment or instant message mining.
However, we simplified sentiment analysis to a binary classification problem. Positive and Negative are not enough to cover all kinds of emotions. A more complex network should be studied in the future. Up to date, the convolutional neural network has been successfully applied in the field of computer vision. The depth is now considered to have reached hundreds of layers in some typical network architectures. For the natural language processing tasks, the convolutional neural network model depth is still very shallow. Therefore, making full use of the convolutional neural network to extract higher eigenvalues automatically and establish a deeper model to solve the multinomial sentiment classification tasks, is promising.
