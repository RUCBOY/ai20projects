In this paper, we have proposed a multiscale blur detector by learning discriminative deep features. To our best knowledge, this is the first practical deep CNN model for blur detection. We show that a simple 6-layer CNN can achieve superior blur detection performance on challenging real-world dataset over state-of-the-art blur detection methods at both single and multiple scales. The effectiveness of our model is further verified through the discriminative power refinement of blur features extracted by deeper network layers. To conquer scale ambiguity, we further fuse the multiscale blur likelihood maps to generate more robust blur detection. We custom a way for blur detection network parameter reduction by analyzing the functions of the feature maps. On benchmark datasets, the proposed detector achieves significant performance improvement over state-of-the-art methods. We also apply our blur likelihood map as saliency prior in saliency detection, and find that blur-aware saliency detection can constantly beat the original form for 4 latest saliency detectors.
In the future, we are interested in developing more compact network architecture and further exploring blur-aware saliency and co-saliency detection [34], [35] in video sequences. We also plan to use adaptive sampling strategy [42] and structural matching [43] to construct effective CNN model for fine-grained mural deterioration changes detection [45]. Besides, how to integrate interactive segmentation [31], [44] and spherical panorama imaging [46] in mural deterioration degree segmentation is another important and interesting future work.
