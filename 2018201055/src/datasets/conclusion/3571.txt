A framework for human detection is proposed in this paper by generating a feature vector i.e. ImHOG which can differentiate local patterns properly. ImHOG is derived to alleviate limitations of GH and HOG. GH differentiates a dark ROI in front of a bright background and vice versa. HOG generates the same feature for some different local patterns. The proposed feature vector ImHOG solves these problems by adding a new bin, i.e., exBin to HOG. The exBin could distinguish patterns misclassified by HOG and does not separate a dark ROI in front of a bright background and vice versa. As a result, the proposed feature vector ImHOG alleviates the limitations of GH and HOG. However, the proposed framework assumed backgrounds to be entirely static (like rain, a waving tree branch confuses the proposed framework). The changing background problem can be solved through analysis of temporal variations.
