Nowadays, the need for sharing medical images is growing rapidly, and advanced medical information system is changing the way that medical images are stored, accessed and distributed. A large amount of patients’ personal information is included in medical JPEG images. Thus, the privacy protection of medical JEPG images has become an important issue. Steganography is a useful tool to conceal patients’ information in the medical images. Most of existing JPEG image steganographic schemes might destroy the inter-block dependencies of DCT coefficients, and thus the security performance is not satisfied yet. In this paper, we first investigate an adaptive strategy that synchronizes the modification directions for the same position of adjacent DCT blocks, and then the cost values are adjusted dynamically according to the modifications of inter-block neighbors in the embedding process. A novel medical JPEG image steganographic scheme is designed based on preserving the dependencies of inter-block DCT coefficients. Comparative experiments show that the proposed scheme can effectively cluster the inter-block embedding changes, and obtain better anti-steganalysis performance.
