In online multiple object tracking, the appearance, motion and shape cues are wildly used to represent the target. In this paper, we propose a novel EOC model, utilizing the context information around the target. With the EOC, the proposed method not only enhances discrimination between different targets but also refines the detection bounding box of the target. In addition, to represent the EOC background changes and target better, we employ a CHG feature which combines the color histogram and the histogram of orientation gradient. Finally, we have tested our method on a large number of datasets and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed online multiple object tracking method with EOC.
