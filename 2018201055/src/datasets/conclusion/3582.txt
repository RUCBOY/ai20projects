Trust was found to be the strongest predictor of farmers’ intention to adopt mobile SMS to provide their farm related information. This clearly highlights the importance of establishing a trusted relationship with the farming community in order to utilize the full potential of citizen science in the agricultural domain. In addition, managers of agricultural citizen science projects need to ensure that using mobile SMS for agricultural data collection offers utilitarian benefits to the farmers. Further, the technology that will be used as part of the digital citizen science need to be easy to use by the farmers. Moreover, the cost of using the technology need to be affordable by the farmers and whenever possible, the citizen science projects need to cover the data transmission cost. Multi-group analysis using farmer’s characteristics age and experience as moderator variables revealed that performance expectancy was important for younger farmers; whereas price value was important for farmers who did not participate in a mobile SMS experiment.
