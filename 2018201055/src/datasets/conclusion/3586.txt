In this work, we propose a novel framework for modeling the background subtraction. There are several innovations in this framework, like defining DN and DR, constructing MV, accelerating the Varying KDE (VKDE), adaptively selecting the thresholds and putting forward an update method, named Tetris update scheme (TUS). Experimental results show that our method achieves a promising result compared with contemporary state-of-the-art methods.
However, there are still several concerns worth studying deeply in our further work. Firstly, we need to establish a more clarified relationship between DN and thresholds mathematically. Secondly, in addition to being robust to noises and appearance changes, TUS will be further delved in for other challenges, like bad weather. Thirdly, we will optimize our algorithms to reduce the computational time, and then try to implement the framework by OpenCV with considering GPU for real-time applications.
