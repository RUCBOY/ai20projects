Novel and concrete design solutions are still required to enable users to communicate their intentions more directly in computer systems. Emoticons (or emojis) are largely used nowadays to augment digital communication. This article explored an approach to intention expression to support user communication introducing Intenticons, i.e., emoticons specifically designed to express intentions. Our study contributed to investigate the potential of participative approaches in the design of expressive emoticons suited to communicate intentions. This work compared a set of Intenticons with a control set of emoticons, which were selected by designers without the involvement of end-users. In the experimental study, the participants assigned the degree of representativeness for each emoticon for various intention classes. We carried out statistical analyses to examine whether there were significant differences in the results between the Intenticons and the control set. Except for the Valuation and Contrition illocution classes, the results revealed that the representativeness of the Intenticons is higher than that of the control emoticons for all other illocution classes and dimensions. Our results and lessons learned indicate to future designs the adequacy of the user participation as a promising design strategy in addition to the research challenges to be faced in this process. Furthermore, our research provided an initial set of Intenticons, which can be reused and improved. Future work involves further investigation on the Intenticons in different interaction contexts. This includes the implementation of mechanisms that explore the Intenticons in collaborative activities.
