We have presented our experiences in transferring one petabyte of science data within one day. We first described the exploration that we performed to identify parameter values that yield maximum performance for Globus transfers. We then discussed our experiences in transferring data while the data are produced by the simulation, both with and without end-to-end integrity verification. We achieved 99.8% of our one petabyte-per-day goal without integrity verification and 78% with integrity verification. We also used a model-based approach to identify the optimal file size for transfers; the results that suggest that we could achieve 97% of our goal with integrity verification by choosing the appropriate file size. We believe that our work serves as a useful lesson in the time-constrained transfer of large datasets.
