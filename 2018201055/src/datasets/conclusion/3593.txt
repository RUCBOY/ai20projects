Early diagnosis of cognitive impairments are essential to provide better treatment for elderlies. Praxis test is accepted as diagnostically indicative sign of cortical pathologies such as AD. Despite being uncomplicated, straightforward and reliable estimate of the AD, the test is frequently ignored by clinicians. To avoid such situations which arise during this process, we proposed a computer-assisted solution to undergo evaluation of automatic diagnosis process with help of computer vision. The evaluations of the system can be delivered to the clinicians for further assessment in decision making processes. We have collected a unique dataset from 60 subjects targeting analysis and recognition of the challenging gestures included in the Praxis test. To better evaluate the dataset we have applied different baseline methods using different modalities. Using CNN+LSTM we have shown strong evidence that complex near range gesture and upper body recognition tasks have potential to be employed in medical scenarios. In order to be practically useful, the system must be evaluated with larger population. However, satisfactory feedback of clinicians from our preliminary evaluations is a promising commencement.
