Concurrent hash table is a crucial component in modern software systems. A range of CHTs has been proposed to tackle practical problems with hardware-specific optimizations and intricate algorithm designs. However, to better understand the pros and cons of existing CHTs, an in-depth and comprehensive analysis is needed. To this end, we develop a testing framework to evaluate 5 state-of-the-art CHTs in a unified way. The measurements and comparisons are conducted over a wide spectrum of metrics, spanning from macroscopic throughput to microscopic latency, from on-chip caches and to main memory, from complex synchronization mechanisms to portable optimizations, etc. To our knowledge, this study is the most extensive evaluation on CHTs to date. We believe the implications made in this paper are valuable for both future research and algorithm development in practice.
