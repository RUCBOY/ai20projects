This paper presented a novel dimension reduction approach to 3D action recognition. By our proposed method, we investigated actions by learning (1) the discrimination of joints, and (2) the DPs for individual actions and the entire training set. The OB estimation of RF was applied to learn the DPs. Then only the features of the DPs for the entire training set were fed into the SVM classifier. Experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to other methods in recognition accuracy and computational cost. In the future, we will conduct studies for applying the learned DPs to design features and recognize more complex activities.
