The tool for computer-aided interactive mathematics learning adapted to the needs of the blind has been designed, implemented and deployed as a platform for class and distance learning. This paper summarizes the experience of deploying it. The designed solution helps to overcome many barriers that occur in teaching impaired students. In the future it is intended to automate the process of adapting new math exercises.
