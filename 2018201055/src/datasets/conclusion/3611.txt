A thoracolumbar fracture needs to be treated at the earliest by the orthopedic surgeon. The conventional method of manual screening of CT scans are time consuming and prone to manual errors. Hence, in this paper, we have developed a novel CNN classification model to automatically detect the thoracolumbar fracture. The designed model is evaluated using 1120 CT images belonging to 160 subjects (normal: 60 and fractured: 100). Our method achieved 99.10% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 97.61% specificity. The obtained sensitivity (100%) reveals that proposed model can efficiently classify all abnormal subjects as abnormal. Hence, orthopedist needs to concentrate only on the normal subjects. This will reduce the workload of the clinicians significantly. In future, we intend to detect different stages of thoracolumbar fractures using more diverse subjects.
