The analysis of large-scale, complex and dynamic networks is important and has many applications. DNAV provides an alternative visual analytic approach to pattern recognition and anomaly detection in dynamic networks. Aggregation overviews and dynamic graph views, when combined, provide better scalability and insight than any individual perspective. In particular, dynamic graphs utilize spatiotemporal segmentations of graph components, such as nodes and links, to encode both topological and property dynamics associated with evolving networks. We demonstrated the usage of DNAV through case studies and suggest potential benefits provided by DNAV in understanding other types of dynamic networks. Future work is needed to explore alternative methods to improve scalability for larger networks.
