We have proposed an AI-aided art authoring system (A4) so as to fast and easy creation of stylized stroke-based paintings. Our main contributions in this papers are (i) we developed a device to capture artists’ brush strokes, (ii) we collected training data in various styles, (iii) we applied inverse reinforcement learning to learn the reward function from the data provided by artists, (iv) we applied the method of regularized policy gradients with parameter-based exploration to accurately learning the policy function, and (v) we demonstrated through experiments the effectiveness of our proposed approach in converting photographs into stroke drawings.
In the future, the data of the artist drawing motion is essential in order to learn more information. We would like to upgrade the capture system for recording not only 2D canvas, but also the artist’s guesture information in 3D space. Meanwhile, an automatic contour extraction from pictures may be explored to simplify the process of photo stylization for non-expert users to both learn and detect local contour-based representations for mid-level feature information in the form of hand drawn contours in images. Meanwhile, the human hand movement is also important to learn the style.
