In this paper, we address real-world species recognition task which is more challenging and makes more sense. Based on deep learning and visual attention, a novel recognition schema is proposed. Images are cropped in terms of visual attention before recognized. AC helps us focus on our real interested target and remove the interferences. And we apply it as a data augmentation method. It is the first time to crop images in terms of visual attention for data augmentation although there have been many data augmentation methods in deep learning community. An extensive comparative experiments are carried out on different types of datasets including Oxford flower which is a traditional dataset and PlantCLEF which is a specific dataset for real-world identification. Experiments show that new state-of-the-art results have been provided. What is more important, contrastive results indicate that superior improvement is obtained by using AC. And the performance is quite significant especially in realistic identification. What is worth mentioning is that AC can be applied to other recognition tasks and application scenes in the vision community although we mainly focus on real-world plant species recognition in this paper.
In addition, with regard to future work, it would be interesting to investigate a problem that the recognition system has the ability to conduct unknown and never seen categories. And new technologies of machine learning keep future potential role for the interdisciplinary research field of species recognition including real-world species identification for the next few years.
