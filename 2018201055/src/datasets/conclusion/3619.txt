In this paper, the problem of breast tumor detection was addressed by employing FCMRG algorithm for segmentation of mammograms, which is one of the noteworthy stages in medical imaging. In order to capture the characteristics of segmented tumor, novel feature extraction techniques called LBP-GLCM, LPQ and hybrid features are used. The mRMR strategy is used to indicate discerning features from the proposed feature sets. The discriminating ability of these features is evaluated to categorize the tumor as benign or malignant by exercising different machine learning procedures. Experimental results exhibit that the proposed system was able to classify breast tumor with remarkable accuracy of 98.2% on MIAS database with hybrid features. The outcome delineates that hybrid features set enhances classification results in term of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy through Decision Tree classifier. Improved classification accuracy was detected when compared with other state-of-the-art mammograms tumor detection methods.
In future, we plan to employ more powerful and robust features to categorize the mammograms images into multiclass in accordance to BI-RADS level.
