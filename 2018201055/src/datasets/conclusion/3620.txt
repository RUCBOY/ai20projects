One of the aims of this paper was to provide a systematic comparison of COR and CS. Achievement of this aim revealed that there is sufficient commonality between COR and CS to provide the basis for a meaningful alignment and, at the same time, sufficient difference between them for this to be worthwhile. COR's strength in intervention-based approaches, offering access to practical methods for structuring social issues and managing knowledge and value claims, and CS's foci on engaging citizens in the analytical examination of the world, and the assessment of information quality and risk, means that they might come together for mutual learning. The achievement of the paper's second aim, to establish how an alignment of COR and CS might be realised in practice, has led us to argue that there is a need for:
•The evaluation, at the meso level, of micro level cases of combined COR and CS practice that yields theoretical learning, and•Recognition that there is an important role for COR, in support of CS, at the meso and macro levels in offering analytical support to assist understanding of how belief systems come about and how they can be influenced in networked societies.
These needs are of heightened importance at a time when society's long-granted authority to institutions (for example, the education, science and legal systems) that employ rational inquiry, capable of challenging unevidenced personal belief, is in jeopardy. Recent scandals involving high profile actors in such institutions, and concerns regarding the unequal distribution of resources, have undermined their status; but such circumstances, it may be argued, represent an opportunity for a much needed alignment of COR and CS. Of course, we are not the first to identify such a need (although previous authors have not focused specifically on COR and CS) and, by way of drawing this paper to a conclusion, it is worth reminding ourselves of Beck's wise words: ‘scientific rationality without social rationality remains empty, but social rationality without scientific rationality remains blind’ (Beck, 1992, p. 30).
