This paper reports on a currently undergoing project, D-MASON, a scalable distributed multi-agent simulation environment that has been deployed with the purpose of speeding up the performance of MASON, a very well-known and widespread framework for ABMs. We have presented, several novel features that have been developed in the framework:
•A novel geometric work partitioning approach (Non-uniform), which exploits the information available on the simulation field (e.g., agents’ positions and their computational complexity) to provide a roughly balanced partitioning even for simulations characterized by an uneven distribution of agents.•A DContinuous3D field, that is a distributed version of MASON Continuous3D field.•A distributed network field, named DNetwork, which enable to perform distributed simulations, where agents’ relations and interactions are described by a network.•A fully decentralized communication strategy, based on the MPI standard.•A Memory Consistency Mechanism, which, at system level, guarantees the perfect synchronization among simulation steps, allowing the designer to devote himself exclusively to the behavior of the agents.
Furthermore D-MASON provides integration for cloud computing environments. Two different approaches have been investigated: a static approach that enables to exploits StarCluster to initiate a D-MASON cluster on Amazon Web Services and an on-need approach, which exploits the novel web system management, enabling the user to allocate and release cloud instances according to the simulation computational needs.
Based on the same architecture, further work is already planned to improve load balancing techniques and support other cloud computing infrastructures. A Unit Test environment is also under development in order to improve the implementation and integration cycle. D-MASON is released under a Free and Open Software license and is available at [53].
