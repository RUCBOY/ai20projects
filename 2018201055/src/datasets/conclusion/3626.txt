In this paper, a novel bottom-up method is proposed for efficient and reliable saliency detection. The designed framework effectively takes both the holistic center-directional cue and the principal local color contrast (PLCC) cue into consideration simultaneously. Experiments show that the proposed framework can highlight and distinguish salient objects from complicated background while significantly diminishes the complexity of the computational consumption. Furthermore, extensive experiments on three widely used databases verify that our proposed method produces satisfactory saliency detection results compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
