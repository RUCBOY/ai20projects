Nowadays, the use of clusters has widely spread both among companies and in the academia. Most university cluster computing courses are focused on High Performance Computing, the most common type of clusters in universities. However, big servers on the Internet usually rely on High Performance Service–High Availability (HPS–HA) clusters.
In this paper, we propose a master course on cluster configuration and administration, that tries to fill this gap. It is the updated version of the previous course presented in [22] that has been taught for several years. In this edition, the topics about HPS–HA have been updated and extended. To this end, we selected some of the most interesting alternatives that are presented in the lectures. In this paper, they have been summarized in Section 3. Moreover, these contents are reinforced through the lab sessions. There, students, starting from scratch, install, configure and test an HPS–HA cluster providing a web service. In order to train the students for their working life, the whole process uses packages and tools widely used in companies. In addition, the lab project allows students to reinforce several important issues. First, how to check if the cluster will work properly after a failure. Next, how clusters allow to scale up the server load. And finally, how the performance bottleneck can be in different points of the cluster.
Students remain highly motivated during all the project but, specially, at the end, when HPS and HA tests show cluster performance improvement and resilience, respectively.
