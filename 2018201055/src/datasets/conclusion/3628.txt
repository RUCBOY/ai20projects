The agreement of real user with problems identified by HE is at a medium level. Among the problems identified by HE, users mostly experience problems such as incomprehensibility of the system design, using codes and figures instead of text and failure to provide solutions for error in system alerts, and the impossibility of emergency exit and navigation to previous and next pages in their real work environment. In a heuristic evaluation, evaluators may identify problems that do not disturb users in the real work environment, while specific problems that are avoidable from evaluators perspective may compromise real interaction of users with systems. This study provided a better insight into the coverage level and conformity of HE results with real usersâ€™ agreement for the designers and developers of information systems. The results suggest that HE is the desired method for identifying specific problems, such as problems concerning recognizing, diagnosing and recovering from errors, but it identifies minor or ineffective problems concerning other principles such as consistency and standards. It seems that if the potential users of the systems are young people with a low computer experience, the HE can be a preferred method for identifying usability problems related to this group of users.
