We have proposed a proximity graph based approach for encoding and querying the geodesic distance map. It supports fast and accurate distance query while requiring only a lightweight preprocessing. The major difference between our approach and the existing approaches lies in that our approach is capable of controlling the relative error, rather than absolute error, which is useful in many occasions. We exhibit the uses of the new approach in two applicationsâ€”real-time computation of discrete exponential map for texture mapping and interactive design of spline curves on surfaces.
