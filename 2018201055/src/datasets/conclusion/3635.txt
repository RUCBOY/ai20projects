Through ocean observation, we can better understand the ocean environment changes and the behaviors of its resident creatures. With continuous scientific and technological advances, it allows us to explore the ocean in scientific and noninvasive ways, such as underwater video technologies. A plenty of underwater videos are continually collected by autonomous underwater vehicles, underwater robots and video monitoring systems, which give us opportunities to make detailed observations and collect samples of unexplored ecosystems. In performing the ocean observing tasks, the ability of underwater image and video analysis is the key to a success, especially with the low quality videos in low-light and high-noise underwater environments. Considering low contrast caused by the low illumination environment, this work presented a CNN knowledge transfer framework to extract abstract features from relatively low contrast image, which can perform better than traditional manual features in such a bad situation. To overcome insufficient training set problem, a transfer approach is proposed to learn a deep CNN model for special underwater object recognition, together with the help of data augmentation. Even with the insufficient training set trouble, the transfer approach can well learn a deep CNN model for the special underwater object recognition. We also proposed a weighted probabilities decision mechanism based on the trajectory of a series of frames, in order to better identifying objects from underwater video. This research work can be further applied on autonomous underwater vehicles to automatically identify underwater object in real time.
