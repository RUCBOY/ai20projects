Based on the reconstruction technique, the RE method combines the methods of detection of dominant SSVEP frequency in both the time and frequency domains. This method can improve the SNR of an SSVEP within a short duration, and can then improve the detection accuracy. When the SSVEP signal is weak, the RE method has a higher accuracy than the popularly used PS method when applied over a short duration. Although the RE and the CCA have almost the same performance when detecting SSVEPs, the RE can be applied when using only one signal channel, which can decrease the complexity of the BCI system. This suggests the RE method can be adopted in a real-time SSVEP-based BCI system.
