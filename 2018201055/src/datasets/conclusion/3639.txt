Despite these limitations, this study contributes to the literature in several ways. Importantly, it is among one of the first studies to detail and compare the technology and interactive social media use of Asian American adolescents and compare it to the use of adolescents from other race/ethnicities. Study results demonstrate that in general Asian American adolescents use all types of technology and interactive social media, except for the computer for school and playing video games, at lower rates than adolescents of other racial/ethnic backgrounds. Second, this study demonstrates that despite the array of technology and interactive social media accessed by adolescents, watching television on the weekday is consistently associated with lower odds of spending 5 + hours on homework per week and earning high grades. In contrast, using the computer for school is consistently associated with higher odds of spending 5 + hours on homework and earning high grades. Both of these associations remained even after controlling for important sociodemographic and individual factors.
