In this article we have presented an algorithm for interactively designing elastic splines. The elastic spline is designed by using a cubic spline where each cubic piece has a small λ-residual. If the λ-residual is small the curve is close to satisfying the Euler–Lagrange equation for elastic curves, and our previous study (Brander et al., 2017a) shows that these curves are close to elastic curves in an L2 sense. To modify the elastic spline we use a database of cubic Bézier curves. From the database we are able to modify the spline by dragging the control points to regions where the spline continues to be close to an elastic spline. Everything was implemented in MATLAB and works at interactive speeds. We have demonstrated how to use this tool to obtain and fabricate surfaces that are foliated by elastic splines. As a final remark we mention that the algorithmic framework generalizes in principle to C2 elastic splines. The idea is the same, but the complexity of the problem increases, because the active point can affect up to four polynomial pieces.
