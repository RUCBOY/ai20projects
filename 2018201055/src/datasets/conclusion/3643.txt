In this paper, we have introduced a simple yet effective approach for domain adaptation on batch normalized neural networks. Besides its original uses, we have exploited another functionality of Batch Normalization (BN) layer: domain adaptation. The main idea is to replace the statistics of each BN layer in source domain with those in target domain. The proposed method is easy to implement and parameter-free, and it takes almost no effort to extend to multiple source domains and semi-supervised settings. Our method established new state-of-the-art results on both single and multiple source(s) domain adaptation settings on standard benchmarks. At last, the experiments on cloud detection for large-size remote sensing images further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in practical use. We believe our method opens up a new direction for domain adaptation.
In contrary to other methods that use Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) or domain confusion loss to update the weights in CNN for domain adaptation, our method only modifies the statistics of BN layer. Therefore, our method is fully complementary to other existing deep learning based methods. It is interesting to see how these different methods can be unified under one framework.
