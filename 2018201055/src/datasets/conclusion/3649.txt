A 1,964 word-family SSWL was developed for L2 learners of soft-sciences in ESAP programs. Knowledge of the SSWL words may allow these learners to achieve 94%â€“97% coverage of soft-science speech. The list is a useful resource for soft-science students irrespective of their current vocabulary levels and subject areas. This study also shed light on the nature of vocabulary in academic speech of hard- and soft-sciences. It revealed that knowledge of the most frequent 3,000 words of general English is important for comprehension of spoken texts from both hard disciplines and soft disciplines; however, the value of these words is greater in soft-sciences than in hard-sciences.
