The separation of reflection components is an interesting but ill-posed problem. We demonstrate that the difficulty of this problem can be reduced with the assistance of surface geometry by introducing a novel prior for the specularity layer. We also propose a unified optimization framework and a numeric solution to find the optimal solution. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
