In this paper, a novel finite-time varying-parameter convergent-differential neural network (FT-VP-CDNN) has been proposed and used to solve nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems. A convergence theorem on the finite-time of FT-VP-CDNN has been proved. Theoretical analysis has proved that FT-VP-CDNN possesses faster convergence speed than FT-VP-CDNN since the upper bound of the convergence time of FT-VP-CDNN is less than that of FT-FP-CDNN. Computer simulation results have verified that the FT-VP-CDNN is faster and possesses stronger robustness than that of FT-FP-CDNN when solving nonconvex optimization problems with inequality constrain. The theoretical and simulation results would promote the neural dynamic methods to solve the nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems in future.
