Although user purchase records or feedback comments are helpful to reduce the gaps between product concepts and designed alternatives, when a new product is introduced, these documents are difficult to collect because of lacking transaction samples. Thus, a systematic approach to recognize key determinants that influence user adoption or purchase intention is more feasible in practice. The Bass model has been widely applied to forecast new product adoption or new technology diffusion, however, it cannot identify significant predictors or the moderators between product features and user intentions. This study incorporates data analytics into design science to accomplish the following goals:
•User preferences for engineering features (PU) and user perceptions of gesture features (PEOU) are used to forecast behavioral intentions (BI),•The causalities of product features with regard to significant moderators are captured to help firms target the ad-hoc user groups (niche segments),•The identified significant EFs and GFs can help firms achieve a satisfactory forecasting of user intentions and design next-generation smart-TV.
Based on the identified significant moderators and key product features, smart-TV manufacturers know how to partition the entire market more effectively and allocate R&D resources more efficiently. Thee directions are suggested for future extension: (1) In addition to technical EFs and ergonomic GFs, Kansei features including stylishness and body color can be considered [43]. (2) Behavioral intention is not equivalent to actual behavior. To construct a precise model, usage hour and usage frequency can be used to measure actual behavior. (3) Other data-analytics techniques, such as text mining, sentiment analysis, and natural language processing, can be applied to handle online customer ratings and discover insightful information [44], [45].
