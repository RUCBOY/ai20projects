We present a novel classifier, namely MSMM, for the multiclass classification of EEG data with matrix form. In order to construct the MSMM, we propose a novel objective function by combining the square Frobenius norm of the tensor-form model parameter and nuclear norm of matrix-form hyperplanes extracted from the model parameter, and develop an efficient solver based on ADMM framework to solve the objective function. Compared with existing EEG signal classifiers, the proposed MSMM can leverage the structural information encoded in EEG matrices for more accurate multiclass classification, and hence improve the performance of BCI systems with multiple tasks. To our knowledge, we are not aware of any previous classifier that can support multiclass classification for EEG data in matrix form. We extensively evaluate the proposed MSMM on two benchmark multiclass EEG datasets. The MSMM has yielded an average kappa value of 0.880 and 0.648 for dataset IIIa of BCI III and dataset IIa of BCI IV, respectively, and achieved the best results when compared with state-of-the-art or widely used classifiers for EEG data. Although the proposed method is applied to MI-based EEG data, it is general enough to be used in other BCI systems involving multiclass matrix-form EEG signals. Further investigations include assessing our method on more single trial EEG datasets or advanced cross-subject EEG features, and integrating it in BCI systems involving multiple tasks.
