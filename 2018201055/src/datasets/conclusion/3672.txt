Recent contributions show that DNA molecules can be used for massive parallel computing. This technology utilizes the inherent property of DNA strands that can be lead to revolution in calculations. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to design of digital circuits based on DNA molecules that uses the wonderful parallelism of DNA molecules. We modeled and implemented the proposed method and simulated it using VisualDSD toolbox. Simulation results show the feasibility and quality of the proposed methods. The main feature of the proposed method is that delay of the circuit is constant for any size of circuit (O(1)). Our ongoing research is focused on extending the proposed method for large circuits and realizing this method on microfluidic platforms.
