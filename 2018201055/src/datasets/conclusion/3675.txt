Classification performance is a good measure of the reliability of the feature set. Since samples are classified based on pulp firmness, results indicate that this internal property is linked to the color of the fruit peel. Through color image processing, satisfactory results are reported for papaya grading based on pulp firmness. By combining hand-crafted image features with machine learning techniques, it is possible to reach higher accuracy and improve classification models for the papaya fruit. This particular application of computer vision could enable the development of a relatively simple and automated system to sort papaya according to different levels of maturity. Digital imaging technologies continue to change at a rapid pace and the techniques that have been developed can evolve into industrial applications with the right integration framework. Further investigation is required for achieving robust levels of ripening prediction. This can be done through more elaborate hand-crafted features and fast learning using some extreme learning machine variant, or through the use of deep learning in which directly distilling information from images allows the reduction of human bias.
