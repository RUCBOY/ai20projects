During the execution, a program typically exhibits a set of distinct behaviors or phases that are often repeated throughout the execution. These phases occur at large time scales (tens of milliseconds or even seconds), during which the program's performance and power consumption stay relatively stable. Based on this observation, we propose a new power prediction method that extends a cluster-based program phase detection scheme. The method can be applied to both sequential and parallel programs. We apply program analysis to identify the types and the number of instructions being executed during fixed intervals, and we show that by coupling that with the program phase behaviors we can quickly establish a baseline for predicting the program's power consumption. In particular, we show that, using the power measurement of a few representative intervals, we can apply a multi-variable linear regression method to estimate the power consumption of entire program with good accuracy.
Our method is fast and effective for profiling the power consumption by analyzing program execution. In future work, we would like to extend our method to incorporate online power prediction. In particular, we would like to integrate an online classification technique for program phase detection and couple that with advanced power models, in order to achieve accurate online power prediction.
