This study focused on the interactivity in e-textbooks and the effect they have on students' perceived learning, final grades, and cognitive load. The interactive e-textbook group had higher perceived cognitive and affective learning and also indicated a higher preference towards using an e-textbook compared to a print-based textbook. The static PDF e-textbook group had significantly better results on the final test result. No significant difference was found between the groups in comparing the cognitive load. The majority of research in higher education and the implementation of e-textbooks compared to printed textbooks, has found little or no difference in grades or student learning. By focusing on the interactivity of the e-textbook, the results of this study demonstrate the effects of interactivity on student learning. The results indicate that through including multimedia and interactivity in e-textbooks, studentsâ€™ perceived cognitive and affective learning can be increased. Focusing on only grades may not give the real effects of e-textbooks on students and the benefits of interactivity may not be captured.
