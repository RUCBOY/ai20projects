In conclusion, a method to calculate the stereoscopic computer-generated hologram is presented. Each hogel is calculated by using the efficient nonuniform sampled WRP (NS-WRP) based algorithm, giving rise to the reduction of stereoscopic CGH calculation load. Meanwhile, the reconstruction from the CGH can provide occlusion effects and accurate depth information of the 3D scene. Both of the numerical simulations and optical experiments are conducted to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.
