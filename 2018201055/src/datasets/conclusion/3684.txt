In this paper, we have investigated different emotional states of human based on higher-order statistical parameters. We have introduced a new dimension reduction technique (correlation based subset selection) of input channels and select the most relevant emotion-specific channels for classification. Then we extract useful HOS features from those relevant channels and perform LDA classification. The execution time of our proposed algorithm of dimension reduction is O(n2 + 2n). We have performed the performance analysis of classification process using the proposed algorithm (dimension reduction process). The classification accuracy has been computed using the confusion matrix and different statistical parameters (sensitivity, specificity, prevalence, precision). After comparing with other well-known models, we can conclude that our proposed model outperforms others. In the future, we try to develop the classification process for a large number of non-linear data using different SVM kernels and figure out the efficient kernel for emotion classification.
