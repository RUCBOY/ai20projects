In this paper, we proposed a DCR module with cross residual shortcuts to enhance the information exchange among deep CNN layers, and applied it for HEp-2 cell staining pattern classification. A class-balanced data augmentation method has been successfully used to train deep networks with limited data. We observe from the visualization of feature maps that DCR module with more CC can capture finer image information and produce more discriminative features. Our approach achieved state-of-art results on two benchmark datasets, i.e., 80.8% ACA in the ICPR 2012 dataset and 85.1% MCA in the I3A task 1 dataset, without using any external training data.
