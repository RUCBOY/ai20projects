This study systematically reviews eye tracking research on multimedia learning to synthesize current literature and reveals how eye tracking technology can be used. The study indicates a burgeoning interest in the use of eye tracking technology in multimedia learning research. Research designs that include using college students as participants, science materials as learning materials, and temporal and count scale of eye movement measurements as data sources were the common methodological characteristics of these studies. Eye tracking measurements were used to make inferences about the cognitive processes of selecting, organizing, and integrating in the reviewed studies. Multimedia learning principles, multimedia content, individual differences, metacognition, and emotions were the potential factors that can influence eye movement measurements. Among these factors, metacognition and emotion received less attention from the researchers. Lastly, there were findings supporting the relation between cognitive processes inferred with eye-tracking measures and learning performance.
The rising need for quality multimedia materials in different learning environments highlights importance of eye tracking research that can assist in learning with multimedia materials. This review shows how researchers have benefited from eye tracking technology to study processing of multimedia information with relevant variables. Particular research gaps were also identified. Therefore, this study can guide future researchers and practitioners aiming to enhance multimedia learning. The study supports use of eye tracking technology in educational research areas to investigate learning processes in detail rather than merely looking at learning outcomes.
