The historical evolution of signal processing (from data to information) and knowledge management (from information to knowledge) shows that different techniques have been developed/implemented at different levels of management (from simple control loops to environmental decision support systems). The increased number of potentially conflicting objectives that have been established for wastewater treatment systems (from simple dissolved oxygen control at the WWTP to system-wide control) demands the adoption of more advanced data management techniques, in turn requiring a higher level of specialist education (basic and advanced statistics, artificial intelligence, machine learning). The review of techniques shows that even though a plethora of methods have been developed/tested there are still challenges to be addressed related to the objective comparison of the techniques, the lack of guidelines, the limited validation at full-scale, the lack of collaborative methods and the limited options for active optimization of data information content and quality. In addition, more efforts are needed to develop/implement knowledge generation, management and application techniques.
