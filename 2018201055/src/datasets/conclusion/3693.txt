In this paper we have presented a game based cognitive stimulation system for analysing unobtrusively the performance of Alzheimer’s sufferers during their interactions. Besides delivering cognitive therapy as other CACT systems, the novelty of the proposed system is that it is able to provide an auto adaptive computer-assisted therapy approach which can reduce input of the therapist in terms of assessment and plan formulation. This can help to decrease cognitive effort and assessment of inconsistencies arising from changes in medical staff. Such “automation” non-existent in current CACT systems, also enables learning different types of patients performance in order to assess different interactions and more effectively use the therapists’ knowledge to provide consequent plan formulations according to the individuals cognitive abilities and disease pathway.
We have shown in Fig. 4 that IoT connected dialogue devices for performing cloud-enabled sentiment analysis and affect recognition can be integrated with the stimulation therapy monitoring to provide richer behaviour and cognitive condition information which can be used as part of a pervasive m-health framework tailored to the patient’s individual personality characteristics and care needs.
Preliminary experiments were conducted based on patients’ interactions with the Mente Activa software that found: (1) observed performance improvements on patients’ interactions after a period of using the system; (2) acceptable levels of agreement from therapists towards the automatically generated stimulation plans; (3) levels of difficulty suggested by the system are responsive to patients performance; (4) the integration of an IoT connected device for emotion detection could be used to enhance the therapy scenario and provide a contextual marker against which patients performance and mental state could be better understood. These combination of findings suggests that the presented CACT system can support therapists by providing a more accurate performance and mental health analysis of patients through an automated and consistent selection of cognitive assessments which can help to significantly reduce their workload.
In the future, we aim to perform more extensive experiments integrating the IoT enabled device for sentiment analysis as well as evaluating on larger patient groups in order to analyse the effects of the system’s recommendation on performance changes (due to cognitive decline).
