In conclusion, this paper has presented a CAD system based on the DCNNs and MIL for the detection of masses in multi-layer breast tomosynthesis images. The advantages of the proposed CAD framework are that the model learns complex patterns automatically from 2D slices of DBT data and uses all the information obtained from the slices to analyze DBT images. We showed that the proposed CAD framework outperformed hand-crafted, feature-based, and DCaRBM-based models using the metrics of accuracy, AUC, specificity, and sensitivity.
