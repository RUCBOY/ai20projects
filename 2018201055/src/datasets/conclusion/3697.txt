In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective algorithm for contour detection based on a stacking random forest learning framework on features mapped from multi-scale local and global image features. The model parameters of the feature space are learned from the posterior divergence of the log likelihood of a Gaussian mixtures and sufficient statistics based on deep Boltzmann machine incrementally. We use posterior divergence based Gaussian mixtures model and sufficient statistics based on deep Boltzmann machine to exploit more information rather than use raw features with random forest classifier directly. The proposed approach is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on three benchmark data sets against several state-of-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed algorithm performs favorably against leading methods for contour detection. Our future work includes more effective contour completion algorithms. In addition, we will develop efficient algorithms for object recognition based on contours.
