In this paper, an attempt has been made to develop an improved pathological brain detection system. The proposed scheme initially uses DR2T features to extract the relevant features from the enhanced brain MR images. A PCA+LDA approach has been employed to reduce the feature dimension. Finally, a new learning algorithm called MPSO-ELM is proposed to train the SLFN. The proposed scheme inherits the advantages of DR2T and ELM for detection of the pathological brain from MR images. The experimental results on three standard datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme yields higher accuracy than other competent schemes with a minimum number of features. Moreover, it has been shown that the proposed MPSO-ELM method offers several advantages over other methods such as BPNN, SVM, and conventional ELM.
This work opens up many research directions. The proposed PBDS has been validated on various accessible datasets that are smaller of size, but a bigger dataset collected online will further prove its potency. To improve the generalization behavior of the proposed scheme, images from various imaging modalities such as CT, MRSI, and PET can be considered. Hybridizing a less parameter-based optimization algorithm with ELM is another possible future work. Deep learning algorithms could be investigated as potential alternatives to the proposed MPSO-ELM. In addition, other popular transforms such as nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and contourlet can be tested as the feature extractor.
