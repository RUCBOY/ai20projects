In this study, we proposed a novel correlation-based time window selection (CTWS) algorithm for motor imagery (MI)-based BCIs. In our approach, the optimized reference signals for each class were selected based on correlation analysis and performance evaluation. After that, the starting points of the time windows for both training and testing samples were adjusted using correlation analysis again. Finally, the feature extraction and classification algorithms were employed to calculate the classification accuracy. Experimental results suggest that the CTWS algorithm can provide improved performance compared to directly using feature extraction approaches. More specifically, the average classification accuracy improved 16.72% (p < 0.005) on the dataset of healthy participants (BCI Computation IV Datasets 1), and 5.24% on the dataset of stroke patients, when using the proposed approach compared to using CSP directly. Moreover, we evaluate the performance of CTWS used with Sub-ABLD (a recent proposed algorithm for MI feature extraction), and the average accuracy increased significantly by 7.36% (p < 0.01) and 9.29% (p < 0.05). The proposed CTWS algorithm paves the way for further MI feature extraction research.
