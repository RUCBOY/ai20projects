This paper proposes a complementary facial representation extracting method based on a pair of Conv-Deconv networks. The extracted representations are used to reconstruct the original faces, generate new faces, and interpolate new faces. The method is evaluated on the synthesized clean LSFED dataset, the synthesized distorted LSFED-D dataset, and the real-world RaFD dataset. Good experiment results are obtained.
This work still needs to extend in the future. From the view of facial properties learning, the network can be extended to a multi-task form to extract more kinds of inner-subject variations like ages, wears, etc. Besides, the real-world faces domain and the synthesized faces domain should be adapted before applying our theory into practice.
