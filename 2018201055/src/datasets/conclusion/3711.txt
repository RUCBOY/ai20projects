We have proposed a novel method to create small-scale surface details for fluid simulation. It refined the cohesion term and area minimization term and enlarged the support length for cohesion, which makes the microscopic characteristics of surface details more visible. Besides, our method combined the small-scale surface details model with the DFSPH to improve the computational stability and efficiency. The experimental results show that our method can capture the microscopic features of fluid surface more vividly compare to previous methods, for instance the area minimization effect and adsorption effect of solid boundary. Moreover, our method can keep a good performance in large and complex scene because adding the divergence-free solver. However, there still has problem in simulating multiphase fluids and viscous fluids when surface tension and adhesion is the dominant force acting on particles. So future work would be extending it to multiphase fluids and viscous fluids.
