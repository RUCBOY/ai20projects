We have presented our work on the automated classification of bird species in flight. Little comparable existing work addresses this problem domain. Those that do are mainly semi-automated, and use high-quality individual images, and so not suitable for field deployment. Ours is the first to adequately address this challenge as a robust fine-grained classification problem, and to consider combining motion and appearance features for classification in flight.
We defined a total set of 320 appearance and motion features, in conjunction with standard classifiers, on a thirteen classes dataset. The Random Forest classifier showed the best all-around performance (90% classification rate). We used feature selection to improve performance, which retained about 80 features and improving correct classification rates by around 7%. Comparison with state-of-the-art deep learning image classifiers (VGG, MobileNet), trained and tested on the same image frames of our video dataset, showed that our classification method compares favourably on our dataset.
Our future work focusses on further improving classifier performance, and expanding our dataset of species, through deployment in different contexts (such as migration). In particular, we consider that motion features will be most effective at a range were appearance features are not discernable. We wish to investigate the use of motion features with different temporal resolutions to improve species classification at this distances.
