The TCD codes realization of reversible decimal addition/subtraction significantly reduces the circuit design complexity for decimal computing. In this paper, in comparison to a previous study [17], a more efficient design for reversible ternary TCD Adder with reduction of 31 in quantum cost and 7 in the number of constant inputs and 5 in the number of garbage outputs was proposed. Additionally, for the first time, we have proposed a novel technique for designing reversible ternary coded decimal adder/subtractor on the basis of 1-input shift gates and 2-input M-S gates, which can be physically implemented. Moreover, the novel reversible 3-qutrit ternary adder blocks have been presented. In the proposed adders, unusable inputs and outputs in TCD Adder/Subtractor were deleted. Also, part of the TCD Adder/Subtractor circuit design refers to invalid TCD codes detection and correction circuit design. The circuit proposed for the TCD detector has a quantum cost of 16 and is much more efficient than the same circuit suggested in Ref. [17] with the quantum cost of 21. So using a correction circuit and the proposed reversible 3-qutrit ternary adders, the decimal addition and subtraction can be done on the basis of three while the inputs and outputs are coded according to TCD codes. Our TCD Adder/Subtractor circuit is optimized in terms of Quantum cost, a number of primitive gates, constant inputs and garbage outputs as much as possible.
