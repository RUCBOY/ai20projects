In this study, we improved the enhanced Craig-Bampton (ECB) method. The improved ECB method was created by employing algebraic substructuring and interface boundary reduction. An important feature of the proposed method is that the residual substructural modes were compensated only for the reduced mass matrix, and this led to significantly reduce computation time. We also presented a computer-aided formulation to provide computationally efficient implementation and to decrease the amount of computer memory required. We demonstrated the excellent computational efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method by solving several practical structural problems. The proposed method could handle relatively large FE models that the original ECB method fails to solve.
In future work, it would be very valuable to develop a more efficient formulation of the enhanced automated multi-level substructuring (EAMLS) method. This could then be used as an alternative to the popularly used LANCZOS eigensolver, when large FE models (containing several millions of DOFs) are solved.
