This paper uses the EMDBUTMF method to remove the noise in the face image. The proposed face expression recognition technique is tolerant to the different type of face images. Local Directional Number uses directional information that is more stable against noise than intensity, to code the different patterns from the faceâ€™s texture. The Dominant Gradient Local Ternary Pattern (DGLTP) method encodes the local texture of the facial expression by calculating the gradient magnitudes of local neighborhoods within the image. DGLTP uses more robust gradient magnitude values as opposed to grey levels with a three-level encoding scheme to discriminate between smooth and highly textured facial regions. The proposed method is robust against noisy faces. According to the matching recognition analysis, Face expression recognition analysis, FER time analysis, and average time analysis, the proposed method is better than the existing methods. In future, the face expression recognition ratio can be improved by another face descriptor Fast Representation using a Double Orientation Histogram (FRDOH). Another similarity method using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) can be combined with the existing Support Vector Machine classifier.
