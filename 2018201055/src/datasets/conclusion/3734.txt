Automatically classifying the unconstrained age and gender tasks is a challenging research topic while few researchers have paid attention on this issue. CNN has shown a perfect feature extraction ability while ELM has been proved to be a powerful classifier. In order to make full use of the advantages of this two structures, we propose a hybrid CNN–ELM structure to process the human facial image tasks. Firstly, we present the hybrid structure in detail including design of parameters and layers, analysis of the hybrid architecture, and the derivation of back-propagation in this system during the iterations. Then we adopt several measures to lower the risk of overfitting, for instance, ELM without tuning the weights and biases owns the ability to overcome overfitting while obtaining a stochastic crop 227 × 227 pixels from the input images which contain 256 × 256 pixels also limits the risk of overfitting. Meanwhile, different dropout measures are adopted to do the same works. Finally, we use enough experiments to test the performance of our hybrid CNN–ELM using Adience Benchmark and MORPH-II. Experimental results show that our hybrid algorithm not only accelerates the whole training process, but also improves the accuracy of classification.
