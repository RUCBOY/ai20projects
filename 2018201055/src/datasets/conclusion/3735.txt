Neural networks provide very powerful tools to deal with many problems in computer vision and pattern recognition in general. Recent advances in deep learning neural networks indicate that this trend will be even more prominent in the future. However, neural networks must be configured with a large number of parameters, such as number of neurons, layers, functions and input features. Setting the optimal configuration is a challenge for the system designers. In this paper, we have shown how metaheuristic algorithms can be applied to automate the optimal choice of the input features and the network configuration.
In particular, a new computer vision based expert system has been proposed with the main objective of performing site-specific herbicide spraying of weeds for Precision Agriculture. This system is based on color and texture features classified with artificial neural networks. The metaheuristic cultural algorithm is used for selecting the most relevant features; while harmony search is applied for finding the optimal configuration of the network. The experimental results have clearly proved that this system is able to correctly identify potato plants and three kinds of common weeds, with an accuracy of 98.36% under outdoor light conditions and taking less than 0.8â€¯s on an average PC.
As a future research line, it would be interesting to study the extension of the proposed methodology to other kinds of crops and weeds, and other kinds of capture systems, such as drones. Since the method selects the most relevant features and parameters of the neural network in an automatic way, this extension should be straightforward. A weak point of the approach is that if the density of plants is very high, they cannot be segmented independently. In that case, the classifier can be applied to parts of the image instead of the whole object. Finally, another future work is the integration of the process with the hardware of the automatic spray system.
