Accurate identification of tumors area, volume, heterogeneity of tumor lesion, and locality of the lesion from MRI scan is effectively executed by the proposed automated method. This is important for early, reliable and correct recognition of tumor for providing timely diagnosis and analysis to treatment. Our proposed computerized method can be used to observe and categorize brain abnormalities with high accuracy and can positively contribute to the betterment of such medical system. The outputs of proposed method are encouraging with greater prediction for the different types of abnormalities detection problems. The proposed power law based composite CAD model is very helpful to assist the radiologist in better detection and identification of brain tumor and heterogeneous lesions. This CAD system has an advantage to any medical organization for huge amount of data processing and analytics. Our method makes detection performance better in presence of artifacts and skull that help to improve the detection in boundaries region. The proposed framework is highly automatic; no user intervention is required to produce normal tissues and tumor heterogeneity segmentation.
