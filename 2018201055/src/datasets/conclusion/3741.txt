In this paper we have presented a new hierarchical method for community detection in complex networks. The method is based on Genetic algorithm to split a network (graph) into two networks and this process of splitting is repeated until all the edges are removed. The method is constructed for undirected and unweighted networks. Results obtained on computer-generated networks and real benchmark social network argue for the capacity of the approach to detect real communities. Future developments are required like testing the method on large scale networks, detect overlapping communities.
