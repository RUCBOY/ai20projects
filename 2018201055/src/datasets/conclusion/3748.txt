Despite these limitations, we were able to show using a large sample of students from Grades 5–8 the value that technology can add to a short mathematics intervention that involved high quality mathematics instruction. Our results point to the value of exploring these patterns not by creating a priori manifest categories such as the type of technology activity that students participated in, but rather by exploring latent categories describing the ways in which students experienced the technology activity to be immersive, interesting, useful, and the degree to which the characters were relatable. Our findings highlight the need for instructional designers, researchers, and educators to go beyond asking the question, “which technology activity would be most motivating and engaging?” to instead, start asking questions such as, “how do I provide the most optimally motivating and engaging technology experience for my students regardless of the type of technology activity I use?” Further research is needed to understand the elements of technological learning environments that can effectively trigger utility beliefs, enjoyment, and relatedness in both the technology and in the subject matter.
