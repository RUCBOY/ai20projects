In recent work, we investigated the capability of state-of-the-art neural network approaches for diagnosis of CD and proposed pipelines for fully-automated patient-wise diagnosis as well as for integrating expert knowledge into the automated decision process. To go one step further towards clinically deployable systems, focus need to be on developing transparent pipelines supporting the endoscopist during the whole clinical procedure and not only providing one single final (binary) decision. Computer and physician need to work hand in hand to obtain maximum diagnosis accuracy and acceptance. We are confident that state-of-the-art machine learning technology can be applied and adapted to obtain a software tool leading to a significant progress in the diagnostic workup.
