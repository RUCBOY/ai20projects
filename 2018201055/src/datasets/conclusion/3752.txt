A new feature descriptor ES-DHP is proposed for background subtraction and object tracking. The proposed work utilizes the symmetrical patterns for background subtraction. So, invariant background modeling is achieved using this symmetry operator. Auto-correlation and cross-correlation between spatio-temporal blocks in successive key frames give an exact similarity between blocks. Computational complexity is greatly reduced with the use of key frames. Also, this key frame concept is used to create an adaptive background model. For this above process, ES-DHP is more robust against dynamic background and illumination changes.
The results of the proposed method are compared with other existing background subtraction methods. Performance evaluation shows that ES-DHP performs better than other existing methods.
The proposed system utilizes the symmetric patterns for feature extraction. ES-DHP pattern uses a novel symmetrical pattern. This pattern greatly reduces the length of feature vectors, and it creates a unique feature vector. So, ES-DHP recognizes the identities of objects that enter an occlusion and splits them successfully. The error rate of ES-DHP is less when compared with DHP.
The results of the proposed method are compared with Local Binary Pattern, Local Ternary Pattern, and Local Tetra Pattern using the parameters F-score, FNR, FPR, MMR and elapsed time. Results of performance evaluation demonstrate that ES-DHP performs better than the existing methods for both background subtraction and tracking. In future, it is planned to include automatic accident detection process in the proposed system.
