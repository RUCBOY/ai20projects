In this paper, we have addressed the problem of hyperspectral data classification from the perspective of data representation and learning schemes. A new feature extraction method based on statistical channels was proposed. It allowed for a low-dimensional embedding of the original feature space, thus reducing he complexity of analyzed data. We showed how to compute 14 diverse metrics from any hyperspectral image and process them to improve their discriminatory power.
On the basis of these features we proposed to form a novel ensemble of randomized neural networks. It used Extreme Learning Machines as base classifier and used Random Subspaces method to improve the diversity among ensemble members. This architecture was augmented with a trained classifier combination step that used a perceptron-based training method to compute weights. These were assigned to each classifier and class individually, thus resulting in a flexible exploitation of local competencies of base classifiers and efficient multi-class pattern recognition. Additionally, we showed that such an ensemble method combined with proposed feature representation not only boosts the accuracy, but also leads to forming more sparse committees.
Obtained results encourage us to work with statistical-based data representation and Extreme Learning Ensembles. In future we plan to apply our framework to semi-supervised scenario with limited access to class labels and self-labeling mechanisms.
