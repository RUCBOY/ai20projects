We introduced the problem of designing data-driven ordinal structures for ordinal measures learning, and developed a structured ordinal measure method for video-based face recognition. By reformulating the problem in terms of an implied equivalence relation, we posed the learning problem as a non-convex integer program problem that mainly includes two parts. The first part learns stable ordinal filters to project video data into a large-margin ordinal space. The second seeks self-correcting and discrete codes by balancing the projected data and a rank-one ordinal matrix in a structured low-rank way. Weakly-supervised and supervised structures are considered for the ordinal matrix. We developed an alternating minimization method to efficiently minimize the proposed non-convex formulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our SOM methods provide state-of-the-art results with fewer features and samples on three commonly used video face databases.
The future work lies in two directions. First, our results show that the proposed output structures (the optimal ordinal matrices) are useful for video-based face recognition. Hence one direction is to design or learn optimal ordinal matrix based on various facial attributes, which have been shown to further improve recognition rates. Second, our results also show that SOM can efficiently compress redundant samples, resulting in a small set of unique samples. During classification, these unique samples can be treated as representative samples or anchor points to represent all video samples. Hence another potential direction is to apply the proposed method to the area of representative sample learning.
