In this paper, we introduce a new process called context-dependent image quality assessment in which the context and intent behind the image observation define the acceptable image quality threshold. We proposed a two-part machine learning solution to estimate the image quality of compressed Mastcam images given the context of the observation as perceived by a scientist. This differs from previous work on image quality analysis because quality is not an objective measure of feature distortion in an image, but rather a context-specific measure of scientific utility that represents the likelihood that artifacts introduced during compression will complicate the scientific analysis of the image.
First, a logistic regression model based on joint entropy between a compressed and uncompressed version of an image was trained using a small set of data to predict the label (accept or retransmit) a scientist might apply to an image if both the compressed and uncompressed image were available. This method enabled us to label a large enough dataset to train a CNN without requiring domain experts to label tens of thousands of images.
Second, we use this labeled data to train a CNN to estimate the scientific utility of a compressed image, or the probability that a scientist using Mastcam data would accept the quality of a compressed image given the observation's context. We demonstrated with a user study that the proposed CNN's predictions correlate with perceptions of context-dependent image quality by scientists. When assisted by our proposed method, we conclude that a Mastcam scientist could spend significantly less time reviewing a subset of images prioritized by our machine learning method than with the existing manual method that requires the investigator to review all of the images.
