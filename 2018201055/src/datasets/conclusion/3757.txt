In the case of the diffusion gradient distortions typical for clinical MRI scanners, the differences between the real and measured direction of fibers is significant, especially on the regions outlying the magnet isocenter. This kind of errors should be taken into consideration during quantitative DTI measurements or high-precision DTI-based tractography. The need arises in particular for the cases when the high precision is particularly required e.g. the crossing fibers areas. The deviation error depends not only on the degree of distortion, but also on the orientation of the fibers inside the scanner, what can be unintuitive.
The BSD-DTI method has a potential to effectively correct the erroneous indication of the fibers direction. Since the b-matrix describes the properties of the diffusion gradients in every diffusion weighted sequences regardless of the applied model. Therefore, the BSD approach could be employed in every modalities that employ the b-matrix, like multitensor fit or diffusion kurtosis imaging.
Although this paper was intended to be theoretical, the experimental data has been presented to validate the results obtained in simulations. Obviously, the experimental space has not been completely exhausted and is proposed for future researches.
