We propose a method for computing the intersections of DBSCs, which are 2D regions enclosed by their boundaries. The key problem is to obtain the intersection points of the boundary curves. In our approach, the disk Bézier clipping method is first proposed to get approximate intersections. Then the approximate intersections are taken as initial values to get precise intersections. An accurate intersection computing algorithm is proposed by the extension of the Newton’s iteration algorithms. By tracking the intersection points, we can finally achieve the 2D intersection regions. Our method is efficient to compute all intersections of DBSCs with high precision as shown in Section 6. The speed relies more on the actual intersections rather than the complexity of the curves, and with the complexity of DBSCs rises, the advantages of our algorithm becomes more outstanding compared with other methods. Our algorithm can be extended to DBSCs intersection of higher degree (greater than 3).
This paper, being the first to provide a parametric form of DBSC’s boundary, greatly facilitates the computation of its boundary’s properties such as tangent and normal vectors. This makes DBSC a flexible and low-storage (varying radius) stroke representation. The intersection computation of DBSCs offers theoretical basis to create new algorithms for fields such as animation, computer aided design, and computer graphics.
