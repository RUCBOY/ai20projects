This is the third study on the use of this seizure diagnosis app. It is clear that its use by NPHWs has the potential to be effective and indeed to replace some doctorâ€™s time, making available a scarce resource in poorer parts of the world. It provides evidence that supports the plan of the WHO to devolve much of epilepsy care to NPHWs. Episode diagnosis, is however only one part of epilepsy management and a more comprehensive tool is required. But this study indicates how the combination of task shifting and technology has the potential to change things for the better for this neglected group of people.
