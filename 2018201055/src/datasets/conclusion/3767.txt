In summary, this work describes the results of an analysis of the knowledge and perceptions of degree teachers about active learning methods and intelligent systems in general, as well as, the utility of three IIA systems, as effective tools in preparing and executing learning activities. Our results showed that few or none of the interviewees were familiar with technical terms related to the systems such as “intelligent systems” or “concept/mental maps”. However, they understood the potential utility of the BioAnnote, CLEiM and MedCMap systems, both in the preparation of activities and in their implementation in the classroom. In other words, this work showed that integration of reliable sources of information, bilingualism and selective annotation of concepts were the features most valued by the teachers, who also considered the incorporation of these IIA systems into learning activities to be potentially very useful. Additionally, and taking into account our experimental conditions, this work highlights the utility to integrate IIA systems into active learning, and the results of this work also suggest some key themes to consider when developing these types of systems.
