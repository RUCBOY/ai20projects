There is a growing interest in participating in social-media communities, such as Twitter, to support educators' professional development and learning. While most of the studies have focused on why educators want to use Twitter for professional learning and what they actually do in these communities, this study attempted to understand a more fundamental question: why do certain users remain committed and others gradually dropout in a Twitter professional learning community? This study approached the community commitment problem from the online discourse perspective. Given the large number of tweets and users, we developed an accurate computational model to automatically recognize the cognitive, interactive, and social dimensions of the Twitter online discourse and further employed the survival analysis to quantify the effect of different online discourse on users' commitment time. Such quantified understanding and results can help us develop concrete support mechanisms to help maintain community members' continued participation. Such understanding and further support will influence the sustainability of the community and in turn the entire success of a Twitter professional learning community. After all, without a certain amount of committed users, it won't be called a community, not to mention satisfying its purpose for professional development. Methodologically, it can inspire future researchers of online communities and general social science topics to go beyond traditional qualitative and quantitative methods by conducting large-scale data analytics. Finally, in this study, a coding scheme was developed to capture the three dimensions of discourse that are essential for learning. The coding scheme may serve as a framework for analyzing discourse-based learning that occurs in other informal learning settings, particularly, Twitter-based learning communities.
