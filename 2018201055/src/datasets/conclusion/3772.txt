In this work, an automated identification of IHD based on nonlinear analysis of ultrasound images is proposed. The study is motivated by DD-DTDWT, as it offers large number of the directional sub-bands to analyse the image. The use of DD-DTDWT, entropy and subspace learning inherently helps to get rich features from US images. The experimental results demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed system in successfully identification of IHD using ultrasound images. In addition, the proposed integrated index able to identify the IHD patients more quickly with high accuracy. Our system is an auxiliary tool for the clinicians to confirm their finding on the IHD patients (needs hospitalization or not) and thus improve the quality of life by timely identification of MI. Such a system can be employed in hospitals and community screening. It will be useful in third world countries to overcome the scarcity of hospitals.
Following are the future tasks which are in line with the proposed model:
•Identifying more discriminant features to enhance the performance using various graph embedding framework.•Performance of the proposed model need to be tested with diverse data samples of large patients.•Model can be extended to diagnose different stages of IHD based on LV dysfunction.
