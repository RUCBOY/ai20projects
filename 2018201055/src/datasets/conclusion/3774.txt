Aiming to build an intense es+ beam at CMRR, we firstly established a group of simulation methods and models. MCNP code is employed to calculate the neutron induced γ -ray flux and positron generation rates. A simplified mathematical relationship is derived to describe the positron moderation and es+ escaping process. Computer program SIMION is applied to calculate the es+ extraction efficiency, and to simulate the beam focusing and transport process. Using these models, we proposed a primary design at CMRR. Its basic structure is the well annealed 20 μm thick tungsten tubes with the size of Φ10 × 30 mm each, hexagonal array arranged in a cadmium covered cup. A group of electrical lenses and a solenoid are utilized to perform the focusing and transport tasks. Considering the assembly size and project feasibility, we prefer using the vertical beam scheme settled in the Si-doping channel, which allows 180 mm outer diameter of source. And the beam intensity is expected to be 5×109es+/s.
