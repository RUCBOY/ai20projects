In this paper, we have introduced a new way of constructing more practical continuous leakage-resilient CBS scheme without bilinear pairings, and whose security is proved based on the hardness of DDH and DL assumptions. The security analysisâ€™s results show that our proposal not only can resist against continuous leakage attacks, but also enjoys better performances. Also, we gave a certifcate-based access control scheme with continuous leakage resilience for the WSNs using our CBS scheme. Compared with the previous access control schemes proposed in [6], [7], [10], our proposal has several advantages, such as computational efficiency, communication efficiency, continuous leakage resilience, etc. Because these good performance features, our proposal may have some significant values in the WSNs.
