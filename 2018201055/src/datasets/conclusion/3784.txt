Considering that more than one weather conditions may occur simultaneously in one image, we firstly analyze the drawbacks of taking weather recognition as a single label classification task, and propose a multi-label classification framework for the weather recognition task. It allows one image to belong to multiple weather categories, which can provide more comprehensive description of the weather conditions. Specifically, it is a CNNâ€“RNN architecture, where CNN is extended with a channel-wise attention model to extract the most correlated visual features, and a convolutional LSTM is utilized to predict the weather labels step by step, meanwhile, maintaining the spatial information of the visual feature. Besides, we build two datasets for the weather recognition task to make up the problem of lacking training data. Practically, the experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
In the future work, we plan to introduce the distribution prediction task for weather recognition [47], [48], [49], [50], which cannot only classify the image with multi-labels, but also predict the strengths of different weather class, so as to describe the weather conditions more comprehensively. Besides, other modality information, such as humidity and temperature, can also be utilized in the future work.
