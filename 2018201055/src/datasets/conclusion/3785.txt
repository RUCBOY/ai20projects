We present an automated coarse-to-fine segmentation approach for prostate MR studies obtained with and without ERC. The coarse segmentation was achieved by using a probabilistic atlas constructed for each scan to determine the potential boundary region; the fine segmentation was done using a cohort of trained DCNNs. Our results suggest that ensemble DCNNs initialized with pre-trained weights substantially improve segmentation accuracy and our approach produces more accurate segmentation than current state-of-the-art probabilistic ASM, 3D AAM-based algorithms on the PROMIS12 dataset and shows good qualitative segmentation results on the PROSTATEx17 dataset. Our approach, however, is time consuming and in future work we will explore approaches to minimize the time required.
