We enrich the literature on externalities in SSAs by introducing more general ways to model slot- and ad-dependent externalities, while giving a (nearly) complete picture of the computational complexity of the problem. In detail, we enrich the naive model of SSAs by adding: (i) the concepts of limited user memory; (ii) contextual externalities and (iii) refreshable user memory (i.e., reset model).
This gives rise to the FNEsamodel, where ad- and slot-dependent externalities are factorized as in the cascade model and the FNEaamodel, where the externalities and not factorized.
We satisfactorily solve the problem for FNEsa, whereas our results leave unanswered a number of interesting questions, with regard to both approximation and truthfulness for FNEaa. The parameter c is central to this list. If c is constant, then we do not know whether a constant approximation algorithm for FNEaa(c) exists; this holds also for the special case of FNEaa+(c)-nr when γmin is not a constant. In the latter case, when γmin is instead constant we are not aware of any truthful constant approximation mechanism. Motivated by the fact that FNEaa-r is, apparently, an easier problem than FNEaa-nr, we believe that an interesting direction for future research is to study reset in more detail in order to understand its role w.r.t. the relatively harder FNEaa-nr.
