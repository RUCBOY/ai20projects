Given the unpredictability of driver behaviours and the random and rare nature of crashes, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the necessary data collection should be obtained from naturalistic approaches like the Traffic Conflict Technique. The framework described in this paper is based on the Traffic Conflict Analysis theory in conjunction with Computer Vision algorithms. It can be used as a decision support system for analysts and governments to improve road safety and intervene to prevent accidents instead of waiting for them to happen and collect statistical data to make a decision. A possible future work can involve a behavioural analysis of the driver based on wearable technologies [32]. Also vision systems acquiring information on drivers through video analysis can give further information to the system to better understand what are the causes of a conflict and then to learn how to better prevent an accident. Finally all of the data collected with these kind of systems can be used to make a driving assistive technology that infer how dangerous is a certain road and alert the driver itself or change vehicle parameters in order to prevent certain predefined condition that can create a conflict or an accident.
