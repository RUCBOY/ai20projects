In this work, a unique methodology “Appearance based pedestrians’ gender recognition by employing stacked auto encoders in deep learning” is presented to recognize pedestrian gender as female or male. Classification is done using a computer vision based deep learning approach whereas deep decompositional neural network is utilized for background removal from pedestrian images. The extracted foreground pedestrian images are then passed to the two-layer stacked auto encoder which is followed by a soft max classifier. PETA dataset is used to train the proposed network. For this purpose, view-wise pedestrian images are annotated as front, back and mixed views. Performance of proposed work is assessed on MIT and PETA datasets. The overall accuracy rates of presented approach on MIT dataset are reported to be 82.9%, 81.8% and 82.4% corresponding to frontal, back and mixed views respectively along with the AUC value calculated as 0.90. The comparison of proposed method with existing works reveals its robustness.
Although the results through proposed approach are improved, still this area requires a huge research for further improvements. In future, the suggested work on gender recognition can be extended to part-based body appearances.
