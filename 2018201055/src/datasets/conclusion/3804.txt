In this study, we investigated whether Greene et al.'s (2014) findings regarding digital literacy would hold when the learning task was changed from a focus on knowledge to understanding. Our analyses showed that, in this instance, there were differences in the frequency and kinds of SRL and EC predictive of learning, supporting the importance of studying and fostering adaptive epistemic aims and task-specific digital literacy processing. Such results are informative, particularly in terms of how to conceptualize and measure new literacies of online reading and comprehension, SRL, EC, and digital literacy. Further, this study adds to the evidence that online learning requires coordinated, often resource-intensive, efforts to understand, synthesize, and communicate the complexities of its problem space. In essence, the problems confronting users of online environments and tools are akin to the challenges confronting researchers who wish to understand these phenomena. Science progresses when the unexpected is found and then eventually understood through further research; such is the case with digital literacy.
