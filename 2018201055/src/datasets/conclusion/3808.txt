In this paper, we proposed one joint entropy based learning model for high-quality retrieval. In the process, improved watershed segmentation model is used for pro-processing the learning instances. More importantly, the distribution of learning instances is optimized by our joint entropy model. At last, the adequate experimental results show our methodâ€™s superiority that the number of learning instances is declined compared to some traditional models, especially to deserve to be mentioned, the accuracy using our model is still preserved.
However, there are still few drawbacks for our model. For instance, if one invalid learning instance is incorporated, the error would be accumulated continually in the process of calculation. Moreover, the joint entropy only simulates the distribution of learning instance and some details have been ignored. So we need to do some further research on the model in order to make the results more realistic and convincing. Particularly, some further work has been done in paper [60] that is under review.
