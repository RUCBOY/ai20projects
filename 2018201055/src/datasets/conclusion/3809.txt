This study revealed that smartphone texting was correlated with a more static and more flexed spinal posture compared with desktop computer typing. Comparing two methods of text entry on a smartphone, bilateral texting was associated with an increased cervical flexion while unilateral texting was associated with an asymmetric cervical posture. This indicates both text-entry methods on a smartphone are not favorable from the point of view that both of them were associated with a non-neutral posture of the cervical spine. These findings are likely to impact how ergonomics professional should provide advices to smartphone users. Moreover, even though in controlled ergonomic situations, compared with healthy smartphone users, users with chronic neck-shoulder pain displayed significantly larger angles in right side-flexion during smartphone texting and greater extents of postural changes in cervical rotation during the three investigated text-entry tasks. This emphasizes that users with chronic neck-shoulder pain need to be aware of the adopted posture during texting. However, the group differences were not big and it is possible that the small extents of postural variations were influenced by the controlled conditions for the experimental tasks. Future research should aim at examining the postural changes of smartphone use in a more unrestricted condition in order to gain better insight on this issue.
