This work presented an innovative shape analysis method based on the idea of modeling a shape contour as a randomized neural network. The results obtained through a series of experiments show that the weights of the output neurons of this neural network constitute a very discriminative feature vector, capable of discriminating different types of shape, including synthetic and natural contour, and under affine transformations like rotation and scale. Also, besides the high classification accuracy of each proposed approach (Neighborhood and Contour portion), their combination into a single feature vector improves even more the discrimination ability of the method. As a future work, we aim to tackle the problem of shapes containing holes, so that both inner and outer contour information can be used to model the shape. Also, we intend to evaluate our method using other probability distributions for the weights of the hidden layer of the neural network.
