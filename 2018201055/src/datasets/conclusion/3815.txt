In this paper, a novel locally adaptive classification algorithm, termed as neighborhood preserved sparse representation, is proposed for SPD matrices by fully exploiting the Riemannian geometry structure within data. Specifically, the local consistency constraint, formulated by the geodesic distance under Log-Euclidean metric, is imposed onto the sparse coding paradigm over a Riemannian manifold. Experimental results show that the proposed method can provide better classification solutions than the state-of-the-art approaches thanks to incorporating the local structure of SPD data.
Although our proposed method achieves promising performance in terms of recognition rate, it is still an open problem of sufficiently exploiting locality structure embedded in SPD data for discriminative sparse codes. Next, our future work includes the investigation of how to devise a better weighted constraint, such that the beneficial discriminant representations can be achieved.
