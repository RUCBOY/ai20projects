The emerging cloud storage gains significant popularity in recent years. Certain enterprises have considered replacing conventional network storage systems with cloud storage solutions. Nevertheless, the lack of a thorough study on these systems makes it difficult to make an informed decision. In this paper, we presented a systematic study on the three different storage systems. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we made several interesting observations regarding the suitable environments for each system. We also found out the underlying reasons for the performance behaviours. Overall, we concluded that cloud storage is a viable replacement for NAS under all network conditions, while it is not ready to replace SAN in performance-critical environments. Based on the observations, we made recommendations for each system to improve further.
In the future, we will evaluate the storage systems in Gigabit networks. Other metrics, such as performance per dollar, reliability, and elasticity, will be used to evaluate the viability of replacing NAS or SAN with cloud storage.
