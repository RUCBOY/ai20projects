The simulation and rendering of textile appearance are important in the computer graphics applications. The realistic effect of textile material and numerical computation cost will affect the practical results of applications. In the computer game, textile material rendering processing needs better real-time property so that the textile appearance may be not so realistic. But in the textile and clothing industry, especially in the e-commercial application, the realistic textile appearance is very important.
In this paper, a novel geometric method of modeling structural detail of woven fabric is presented based on the image. The main advantage of the proposed method is a simple and easy-to-use method for visualizing the appearance of woven fabrics. That is significant for the computer graphics application. Given a woven fabric image, our method can visualize the appearance of woven fabric by building their fine-scale geometric model realistically and efficiently. The limitation of this method is that it just considers fabric materials containing only a single type of yarn, and it can only reproduce the exact material that is scanned. In real life, fabrics are complex, including intricate weave patterns, large scale designs, and multiple yarn types for warp and weft, each with its own reflectance; ideally, flexibility to render such fabrics is desired. Further, in the modeling of fabric, more parameters of textile need to be considered to meet the needs of complex fabric structure. With respect to design applications, our research will focus on the real usefulness of modeling, which comes from predicting the appearance of new fabrics.
