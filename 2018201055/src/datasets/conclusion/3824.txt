Determining when to interrupt a user at appropriate times as s/he performs computer-based tasks is an ongoing problem to which we have provided a solution. We created a classifier that contributes to the field in the following ways:
1.The classifier incorporates a user model in its’ reasoning process. Most interruption systems focus on task-based contextual information only. Our classifier includes user and task contextual information.2.The classifier performs better than random, and, in the best models constructed, performs at an accuracy of 98% with historic event knowledge and 95.4% without historic knowledge (Tables 11–13).3.User modelling integration with machine learning algorithms was explored and appears to be very promising.4.The classifier was implemented using an advanced machine learning technology (ANFIS)—which is a novel contribution. No other interruption system uses an ANFIS.5.This research sheds light on reasoning about ideal interruption points for free-form tasks. Currently, this is largely an unsolved problem.
This research also assessed the participant's performance at the tasks and evaluated the classifier's performance. It was demonstrated that many models performed extremely well. The classifier was designed with a framework so that it could be generalized to other tasks and problem domains.
In the spirit of furthering science and this work, the MATLAB source code for the classifier, models, and data sets will be openly available on the author's and/or journal's website. We hope this will encourage other researchers to extend and explore our work and to test and compare our classifier with other interruption systems.
