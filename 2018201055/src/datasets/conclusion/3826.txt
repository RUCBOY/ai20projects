In this paper we have presented a new method for detecting community structure in networks ComDBNS (Community Detection Based on Node Similarity). At the beginning of the method the similarities between nodes are defined in order to cluster the most similar nodes in small communities. Then we merged these communities to find a stable community structure. The second method we have proposed ComDBNSQ (Community Detection Based on Node Similarity and Modularity Q) also has two steps. The first step of ComDBNSQ is same as the first step of ComDBNS but in the second step of ComDBNSQ we used the modularity to guide the process of merging communities.
Our method ComDBNS/ComDBNSQ was validated by tests and comparisons with previous community detection methods. Experimental results achieved on real and computer-generated network demonstrated that our method was rather efficient to discover the community structure in networks.
This approach, developed at the base for undirected and unweighted networks, can be extended for directed and weighted networks with the inclusion of certain parameters such as weight, the sense of direction in calculating the modularity, etc. Finally, our approach successfully tested on monopartite networks, can be also adapted to bipartite or tripartite networks.
