In the present study, a computer-aided methodology based on conventional reflected PLM has been developed and applied to the representation of c-axis orientation maps as well as (0 0 0 1) PFs of two alpha cp-Ti bulk samples with different microstructural and texture characteristics. The authors propose this method to be applied to other alpha or near alpha titanium alloys, as well as for other metals that exhibit a material-intrinsic optical anisotropy such as cobalt, tin, zinc, or magnesium.
