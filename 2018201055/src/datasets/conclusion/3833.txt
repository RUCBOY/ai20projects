In summary, we can conclude that integrating the recent well-engineered deep learning CNNs through transfer learning into the screening mechanism brings an apparent improvement compared to other approaches. The fine-tuning strategy proposed improves the state-of-the-art accuracy classification on many public datasets. The Inception v3 model trained on the merged dataset, which achieved the best accuracy rate overall, was used to develop a mass lesion classification tool. The Breast Cancer Screening Framework devised, could successfully classify many "never-seen" images of mammography mass lesions. It provided highly accurate diagnoses when distinguishing benign from malignant lesions. Therefore, its output could be used as a "second opinion" to assist the radiologist in giving more accurate diagnoses.
Our future work includes using deeper architectures as well as more challenging images to deal with the hindrance caused by mammograms of highly dense breasts. Besides, we suppose that it can also be beneficial to incorporate other imaging techniques in combination with mammography, in the learning process, to help build a robust and powerful breast mass lesion classification tool.
