In this work, we proposed an effective design method for the generation of phase only holograms for holographic display. Small sampling interval Δξ=λf2L instead of Δξ=λfL with high resolution 2M × 2N is set up on the reconstructed plane by using M × N sampling points padding with extra 3M × N zero amplitude on the holographic plane to reduce speckles and granularsensation. Special constraints are also introduced to control the SNR of the holographic image with high speed and accuracy. Compared to the conventional IFTA method, simulated results show the reconstructed image using the proposed method has very low background noise and high SNR, ensuring the reconstructed image is of high quality. Meanwhile, denoise hologram, multiplane hologram and colorful hologram are also simulated to verify good performance of the proposed algorithm, which has potential in holographic display and holographic 3D display.
