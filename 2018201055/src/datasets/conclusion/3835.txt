In this work, a novel way of scene text extraction is suggested under machine learning. By leveraging the primacy of MSER, stable regions are detected on enhanced image using gray scale L-channel. To make robust feature descriptor, LBP and T-HOG feature sets are combined into a single feature vector by weighted sum to identify text and non-text regions perfectly with linear SVM. This helps to detect characters using character grouping of the scene text. Further the output of text detection module is sent to text recognition module as an input. CNN is utilized as a powerful text recognition tool in today’s computer vision problem for recognizing and labeling the text characters. It leverages supervised text information on high scales i.e., text region detection, character labeling and binary text and non-text regions. The presented CNN is trained with positive and negative samples collected from Char74K [27], IIIT 5K [26], ICDAR 2003 [24] and SVT [25] datasets. These multi-selected samples help out to make CNN learning powerful which is then able to robustly extract actual text from unconstrained scene images. Further it is tried to generate text meaning and error correction in text by introducing hamming distance technique. As evidence of the power of proposed methodology, state-of-the-art results are demonstrated on three bench mark datasets.
