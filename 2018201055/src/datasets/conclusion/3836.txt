This study shows that volunteer-based research on microplastic concentrations is a valuable approach for quantifying microplastic abundance in a large, mixed land-use watershed. Microfibers were the dominant type of microplastic discovered, reflecting similar findings from studies worldwide. The presence of microplastics in isolated tributaries raises further questions about atmospheric transport and other pollution sources that are not yet documented. Material type of microplastics may indicate recreational use of the Gallatin Watershed as a contributor to aquatic pollution, suggesting that remote watersheds are impacted by a previously unstudied source. Periods of high discharge were associated with diluted microplastic concentrations in the watershed, but patterns may vary in watersheds with different stormwater management infrastructure, and during the course of an individual flood event. Finally, initial comparisons of microplastic contamination from this watershed and other more developed locations generated a wider gradient of human impacts which was helpful to suggest watershed development as source of microplastic among rivers at a continental scale. Additional analyses are needed to more fully understand source of microplastic in rivers, to inform the position of rivers in global budgets of microplastic, and to measure the effects of microplastic on biological processes in freshwater environments.
