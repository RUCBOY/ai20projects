We propose HMFS, a hybrid memory file system with version consistency. We realize the flat hybrid memory architecture including DRAM and NVM with a unified address space approach. We propose a bipartite graph based solution to guarantee version consistency and achieve significantly boosted time and space efficiency. To our best knowledge, HMFS is the first NVM-aware file system to adopt bipartite graph modeled approach to implementing version consistency. We are convinced that it will give an interesting and a novel view of file system modeling and will inspire a lot of further research on it.
