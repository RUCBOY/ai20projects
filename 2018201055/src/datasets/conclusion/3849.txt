In this paper, we propose a compromise method of handling the special Arabic-Kazakh vowels  and  based on the OpenType font format. This method can avoid the problems encountered when the letter substitution method is used, which include problems with text sorting, script conversion and speech synthesis. In this study, 10,000 common Arabic-Kazakh words were corrected, sorted, classified and counted. Text sorting errors for 2843 words and character ambiguity errors for 3960 words were identified that could be avoided by using the compromise method instead of the letter substitution method. Such character ambiguities might result in incorrect handling during text conversion and speech synthesis.
The advantages of the new method are obvious. However, to date, end users have unfortunately been unable to experience these advantages because the current information systems for Arabic-Kazakh processing have not provided text sorting, script conversion and speech synthesis functions that are compatible with the compromise method. To promote the application of the new method, we have recommended it to the Xinjiang Software Testing Center. The Center has accepted the compromise method and has agreed to recommend it to software companies for the development of software applications related to Arabic-Kazakh processing.
