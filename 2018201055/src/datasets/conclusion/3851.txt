This paper proposes an efficient technique for feature selection and classification of masses in digital mammograms. Biogeography-based optimization technique with ANFIS and ANN is used for feature selection. The features selected by BBO-ANFIS and BBO-ANN are used to train and test ANFIS and ANN classifiers. Performance analysis shows that BBO-ANFIS is superior to BBO-ANN. Although BBO-ANFIS is superior to BBO-ANN, its computation time is higher as compared to BBO-ANN. Results achieved with the proposed method are far better as compared to existing methods. The suggested method can help to improve breast cancer diagnosis and would minimize mortality rate. In future work, we would concentrate on improving computation time of the feature selection and classification system.
