In this paper, we raised the problems presented by malware and attempted to solve them. As zero-day malware is created with modifications, we use GAN to generate virtual data and train to make the detector robust to data deformation. To solve the training instability problem of GANs and detect the modified malware (zero-day attacks), we stabilized the training process by applying the DAE to the GAN, and used the discriminator's ability to extract meaningful features for malware detection. The proposed tDCGAN exhibited better stability than other GANs, and performed the best on malware detection. We did not simply demonstrate the performance of the GAN and MDS, but also performed a thorough analysis. We showed that the proposed model can recognize modified features based on a SSIM value comparison experiment. The malware detector transferred from the tDCGAN achieved an average classification accuracy of 95.74%, outperforming other machine learning algorithms.
In the future, we will expand the types of malware with a range of malware datasets, and address the issue of different lengths of various malware, because the malware code was converted into malware images through crop and pad operations in this study. Moreover, we need to implement full control of the type of generated malware because the proposed model simply generates malware from a random distribution. We plan to develop a model to generate data from specific distributions, so that we can create relatively more data for different types of malware. The proposed model can also be applied to one-shot learning which involves only a little data. The proposed method can be generically applied to any problems that must be solved with sparse data.
