We presented a novel L0 minimization framework tailored for speckle reduction in ultrasound images. First, we formulated a sparse prior of a new measure GAP, which takes both the gradient and phase information into consideration. With the prior, we proposed a global minimization to seek for the L0 sparsity of the GAP. In addition, we proposed an efficient and robust solver, which transfers the intractable L0 minimization into several optimization steps with closed-form solutions. Experiments in synthetic and clinical ultrasound images demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for speckle reduction. The proposed method has great potential to be applied to many intelligent ultrasound systems. In the future, we will accelerate our L0 minimization using GPU, and also test our despeckling method on more clinical ultrasound images and applications.
