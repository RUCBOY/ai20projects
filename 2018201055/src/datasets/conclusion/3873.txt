In this paper, we introduce VD-CRF, a 3D dense CRF model for the semantic scene completion task using a single indoor depth image. Based on the output of the SSCNet, we achieve better results in the voxel-level IoU via building potentials with the voxelized depth data and the probabilistic map. We take some changeable factors into consideration, for instance, down-sampling methods, data encodings, and inference algorithms of dense CRF model. Through comparative experiments, we find that a solution works well with fixed interval sampling, TSDF encoding, and the MF or DCneg inference algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our VD-CRF model outperforms the SSCNet with the advantages of noise reduction and improvements of the geometric structure of the scene. According to the Bilateral Neural Network [50], the potential function in Dense CRF can be a generalized formulation, which can be learned from data. In future work, we plan to replace the Gaussian potential function with the general bilateral convolution and learn the parameters of the kernel automatically.
