This paper focuses on humanâ€“machine interaction application research, combines with the machine intelligence, cognitive science and CEM (Customer Experience Management), and strives to optimize the user experience. Based on AIWAC emotion recognition system, combining with CEM, this paper puts forward a new AIEM method, starts with three aspects of intelligent management of emotion acquisition, accuracy management of emotion recognition, and real-time management of emotion interaction. Then, we introduce the composition and architecture of AIEM. Besides, we investigate the present popular emotion recognition algorithm (such as facial expression recognition algorithm involving Google-Net, Residual-Net and VGG-Net, and speech emotion recognition algorithm involving AlexNet, AlexNet+SVM and CNN+LSTM) for emotion recognition algorithm selection. In modeling and algorithm design section, this paper proposes the emotion computing offloading model and chooses two deep learning algorithms (VGG-Net and Alex-Net) which with higher accuracy for the facial expression and speech emotion recognition mentioned above. Finally, we evolute the computation and communication delay in combination with smart clouds computing architecture and AIEM method using AIWAC system, to provide the comprehensive knowledge and experimental foundation for emotion interaction experience management and conduct the summary for the future research proposal.
