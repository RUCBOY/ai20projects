A systematic review of the 50 DGBLL studies published in the selected journals during the last decade was carried out, and the major findings can be summarized as follows: (1) Most of the selected DGBLL studies adopted mixed methods to examine the educational use of digital games; (2) Immersive games, notably MMORPGs, were the most common genre in the current DGBLL literature; (3) Most of the games for language learning were custom-built by DGBLL researchers; (4) PCs were the most common platforms for playing games to support language learning; (5) Most of the DGBLL studies adopted games to facilitate the learning of English as a second or foreign language; (6) Most of the research on DGBLL investigated learners with mixed levels of language proficiency; (7) University students were the most frequently selected samples in the existing DGBLL literature; and (8) The majority of DGBLL studies featured positive outcomes in regard to student learning, with the most frequently reported ones being related to affective or psychological states, closely followed by language acquisition.
When interpreting the aforementioned findings, several limitations should be considered. The DGBLL studies synthesized here were limited to the search term used, the key journals selected, and the time period of the papers published. Other potential papers may thus have been neglected from this pool of samples. It is therefore suggested that more comprehensive reviews that examine a greater number of papers be conducted to search for more general topics of research interest within a longer time period of publication and from among more varied academic sources, such as Scopus, EBSCO, and ScienceDirect.
This work should be viewed as a pioneering attempt to systematically synthesize the selected DGBLL studies, rather than an inclusive review. It is significant in providing a scoping analysis of the research methods employed, digital games adopted, target languages studied, language learners involved, and student learning outcomes achieved in the existing DGBLL literature. While not meant to be exhaustive, the coding scheme developed in this review study does offer working classifications for analyzing the use of digital games for language learning from multiple perspectives, which may be adapted and refined to guide future review efforts. The major findings detailed in this work also serve to identify critical research gaps and opportunities, providing useful directions for future DGBLL studies.
