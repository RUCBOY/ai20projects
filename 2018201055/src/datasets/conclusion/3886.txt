In this paper, we presented the GA-ETI, a scheduler for scientific applications for cloud systems to concurrently optimize their execution makespan and monetary cost. GA-ETI enhanced the original GA through purposeful/tailor-made modification to its crossover and mutation operators. GA-ETI uses enhanced crossover to combine clusters of genes rather than randomly divided chromosomes; it also employs increment/decrement mutations to add/remove virtual machines from a given chromosome. Both modifications yield reduced inherent randomness compared to the original GA. Using five workflows to represent a variety of current scientific problems, GA-ETI was tested and proved its superiority against three (HEFT, Provenance and FSV) well-known/up-to-date schedulers in this field. GA-ETI solutions had lower makespan and monetary cost when compared with solutions provided by HEFT. Unlike FSV, GA-ETI produces a complete scheduling configuration prior to execution with better qualities. In contrast to Provenance, GA-ETI produces its own scheduling configuration and uses a workflow manager system only as a middleware to execute scheduling decisions. GA-ETI also revealed that, despite the general impression, optimal execution of workflows does not require a high number of resources (compared to the number of parallel nodes) in most cases. To continue this work, we aim to develop/incorporate cloud pricing models to consider fluctuation of the hiring cost of VMs during scheduling. We also aim to focus on performance oscillation in cloud environments and its impact on execution of applications.
