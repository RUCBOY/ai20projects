In this paper, we introduced the concept of a novel authentication method that is a cross between a text-based authentication system and a cued-recall based graphical authentication system, Visual Question Authentication Protocol (VQAP). Our approach increases the security of pure graphical or text password schemes alone by requiring image selection among distractors and the answering of a question related to the image correctly in order to properly authenticate. In addition, VQAP introduces the concept of authentication challenges, including two scenarios in which a question that is asked or images that are shown are not any that the authenticating user had previously registered, requiring that the user identify this incorrect information in order to validate their identity. We believe that this approach can be used as part of a scalable, cloud-based authentication system that preserves user privacy while also reducing effort on the user's part to recall overly complex text-based passwords or vulnerable graphical-only authentication systems.
