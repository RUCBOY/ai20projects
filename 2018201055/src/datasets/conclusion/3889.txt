In this paper, we have presented a facial image analysis-based computer-aided system for automatic face classification. The system is composed of facial image pre-processing, image feature extraction, automatic classification, and results presentation. We combined these methods into a real-world system that is used for screening suspected TS patients in under-developed areas to provide TS patients with early detection and early treatment. The facial image samples in this study were collected and arranged by the automatic TS classification system. Based on the clinical features of TS patients, we have trained a 68 feature-points model to extract the global facial features and the local facial features. Based on our features and some pattern recognition methods, we have achieved desirable accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in TS diagnosis. In addition, we also integrated this system into the server, whereby users can make a preliminary prediction at different terminals (PC browser, mobile APP).
Although we have been collecting positive samples, there are only 69 TS patient facial images. At the same time, both the positive and the negative set were Chinese and the facial images were collected in one hospital and were inevitably affected by regional characteristics. Our study can be further refined into different age groups, different regions, and different ethnic groups. At the same time, in a future study, the facial features of patients should be analysed more meticulously and with greater accuracy. In addition to clinical features, more reliable facial biochemical markers were found to identify the facial features of Turner syndrome.
The study for the actual diagnosis is of great value, especially in improving the objectivity of diagnosis and reducing the workload of doctors. In addition, it is worth noting that the overall diagnostic methods of this study can also be used for solving other medical diagnosis problems with similar facial situations.
