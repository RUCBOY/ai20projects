The research presented in this paper utilized an IFaster R-CNN to detect workers and excavators in real-time on construction sites, which can therefore provide managers with information to improve their decision-making around safety and planning. This was enabled by creating a database of objects from construction sites that was used to train a CNN model to accurately detect their occurrence. The proposed method provides an easy-to-use and low-cost solution to detect objects on-site in real time at a speed of 0.101â€¯s per image. The average detection accuracy of a worker and excavator were 91% and 95% respectively, which exceeds performance levels of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., HOG, SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK) by an average of 50%. This is due to the automatic learning of the spatial features contained within the images of the deep CNN model. The proposed method can potentially be used to automatically detect unsafe actions (e.g., hardhat-wearing detection) and unsafe conditions (dangerous areas) during construction. The corollary being intervention by management and resulting in immediate behavior modification.
Occlusions and the scale of objects were also found to have an impact on the detection accuracy of the CNN. Thus, in future research, optimum placement of cameras to achieve full coverage of resource (e.g., workers, materials and machines) will need to be examined (e.g., position and distance of a camera, effect of occlusion, and lighting conditions). In addition, the reconstruction of three-dimensional models can be used to detect objects and used to calculate the spatial-temporal information to determine unsafe behaviours and conditions that can exist on construction sites.
