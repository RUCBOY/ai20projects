The present study was designed to model and work on human factors elements affecting safety performance of control room operators using a hybrid intelligent approach. The safety performance among control room operators regarding human factors issues in the oil industry was considered in the field and a hybrid intelligent approach was applied to model the data. In the first stage, PCA was used to extract principal components from the questionnaire. In the second stage, the CFS algorithm was used to select most relevant dimensions (features) among 28 extracted components to model safety performance. The findings of feature selection method (CFS) for evaluating the merit of feature subsets showed that the features with the highest merit values included human-computer interface, manual materials handling, safety culture, safe work practices and permit–to–work systems, quantitative risk analysis, competence management, and incident investigation. In the third stage, a genetic fuzzy system was used to model safety performance using selected features. The results of modeling using genetic algorithms revealed that safe work practices and permit–to–work systems, human-computer interface, and staff competence had major effects on safety performance of control room operators.
