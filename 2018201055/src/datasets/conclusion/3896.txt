This paper presents a new approach for unsupervised image segmentation algorithm based on Auto-encoders and multi-layer clustering. We use Stacked Denoising Auto-encoders (SDA) to reduce the dimension of the image patches and extract features from the patches. In addition, we build a hierarchical indexing tree structure using k-means algorithm to automatically label the image patches. Then given a new image, we can extract features from the image patches using the SDA and feed the features into the tree structure to achieve image segmentation. Experimental results show that the algorithm is competitive in precision and computational efficiency.
