
(1)For the images collected in the scene, the lateral view extracted by the proposed algorithm can obtain a segmentation image with better edge information, and can be used to effectively extract the sheep's contour information.(2)A symmetric center extraction algorithm for flexible symmetric body image proposed in the paper was applied in the top view of a multi-body postures of the sheep. The results show that the symmetric center line extracted by the algorithm in the measurement area can well express the symmetric center of the flexible symmetric body.(3)The experiments on extraction of the measuring points of sheep's body image in different body postures show that the algorithm has a good adaptability.(4)The tested results indicated that the mutual complement between the parameters of left and right views can improve the accuracy of the measurement system.(5)The average of several measurements can reduce the deviation from the actual value obtained by a single measurement of the multi-postures body size.(6)The results of live-sheep weight prediction show that the parameters got by image processing can be used for monitoring the growth of sheep.
The experimental results show that the method can effectively measure the parameters of live sheep without a contact with the sheep's body, and hence provide instructions on sheep's evaluation, breeding, feeding based on body dimension in the welfare farming management mode.
