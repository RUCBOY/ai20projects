Urban flooding is difficult to monitor due to various complexities in data collection and processing. The present study shows that social media and crowdsourcing can be used to complement the datasets developed based on traditional remote sensing and witness reports. Applying these methods in two case studies, we found these methods are generally informative in flood monitoring. Twitter data is found weakly correlated to precipitation departure. We determined a length scale of tweet volume pattern, at which the data points are most clustered. The computer vision processed crowdsourcing data is compared against the road closure data. The results show that computer vision still has a room to improve, especially in coastal areas. These two methods are compared and a series of recommendation is given to improve the big data based flood monitoring in the future.
