In this work, in order to show the significant influence of poor bonding between constituents, the samples made of coelectrodeposited Ni-SiC composites with 10% of SiC with poor interface bonding have been prepared. Furthermore, the tensile tests of samples have been performed. The determined Young’s modulus was equal to 67 ± 8 GPa and the ultimate tensile strength to 230 ± 15 MPa. The composite is much weaker than pure nanocrystalline nickel. The very weak interface was assumed to be the reason for this weakening effect. In order to confirm the assumption and get the necessary parameters for the numerical model, the measurement of the normal and shear interfacial bonding strength of SiC particles and Ni matrix in electrodeposited composites have been performed. The experimental results show that the created interface is weak. According to them the normal interfacial bonding strength is equal to 0.1 ± 0.03 MPa and the interfacial shear strength is equal to 4.9 ± 0.2 MPa. According to the homogenized finite element model in the case of perfect interface the Young’s modulus should be equal to 317 GPa for spherical particles and 321 GPa for cubic particles. On the other hand, if cohesive zone elements are applied with experimentally measured properties of the Ni-SiC interface, then computer simulations result in the Young’s modulus values equal to 119 GPa for spherical particle and to 126 GPa for cubic particle. Therefore, for many types of metal matrix particle reinforced composites, their numerical or analytical models should take into consideration the influence of weak interface and delamination. Even a simple cohesive zone models can be applied in order to significantly increase the models accuracy.
