In this paper, we evaluated and examined our proposed partitioning scheme coupled with a GMM-based subject identification followed by GMM-based SSVEP identification utilizing the discriminative MSCE algorithm. In retrospect, BCI systems face numerous challenges that impede their utilization outside the laboratories, such as, sensitivity to noise, EEG׳s non-stationary nature and subject variation. Given the portable setup of our BCI system, it also struggles with an imprecise SSVEP paradigm generation issue. As such, we proposed the partitioning scheme to mitigate the effect of insufficient screen refresh rate to a certain extent. Subsequently, we captured a higher resolution of the subject-specific information, which is intrinsic to an enhanced SSVEP identification performance, utilizing the GMM-based subject identification followed by the discriminative re-estimation of the GMM parameters employing the MSCE algorithm for a more robust SSVEP identification performance. Our experimental results report that while the MAP adaptation proves to be efficient achieving 92.9%, the re-estimation of the subject-dependent GMMs’ weights yielded more robust identification performance as GMM-MAP-MSCE-SVM achieved an accuracy of 97.4% using 8 mixture models. Furthermore, we investigated the performance of our proposed method and compared it to the Multivariate Linear Regression method, which is considered a state-of-the-art SSVEP identification method, concluding that while MLR demonstrated a relatively high SSVEP identification accuracy of 86% compared to CCA and PSDA, our GMM-MAP-MSCE-SVM outperformed MLR achieving 97.4% SSVEP identification accuracy in the best-case scenario.
