We have described a system that provides end-to-end advance reservation access control. By using multidomain SDN orchestration, our system automates the advance reservation provisioning process. Furthermore, by using token-based authorization, our system strongly binds an end-to-end flow to the user or application that requested the reservation. We have deployed this system in the ESNet 100G SDN testbed, and demonstrated that our solution effectively protects authorized flows from competing traffic in the network. Furthermore, the provisioning time of an end-to-end reservation can be reduced from several days (manually) to minutes (automated) on a small scale network. Moreover, the provisioning latency of our system introduces a negligible overhead (approx. 0.40%) on a large data transfer transmission time. These results opens new possibilities for future advance reservation systems in which advance reservations can be more flexible and short-lived (i.e., lasting hours instead of years), allowing finer scheduling of network resources. In future work, we want to explore how the addition of QoS in an end-to-end advance reservation can improve utilization of network resources.
