The presented computer assisted characterization (CAC) method was successfully used to characterize a macroporous nitrocellulose diagnostic membrane. Typical membrane structure characteristics like the porosity, the specific surface area, and the pore size distribution were determined in reasonable agreement with the experimental results obtained by standard membrane characterization techniques. In addition the permeability was simulated with a Stokes approach to further evaluate the structure characteristics by CAC. These results are in good accordance with experimental measurements. The presented methods are capable to reproduce results with common techniques and moreover enable to quantify gradual changes of the porosity and the membrane structure with a local parameter analysis along the z-axis (Fig. 9). The new combined experimental and computational techniques facilitate a quantitative evaluation of the heterogeneities of a macroporous membrane structure. Additionally the characteristic microstructure parameters were determined by CLSM experiments in comparison to three different experimental measurements. In further investigations CAC can be employed to specify a particular membrane type for the use in capillary flow porometry to incorporate a 3D geometrical pore structure information instead of the nowadays commonplace 2D shape information [4], [19].
