The prime aim of this research is to enhance the current state of the art of bare hand gesture recognition in natural conditions. The focus is on the development of intelligent techniques applicable to the spatial domain for processing where the user has no limitation on hand direction and will not use any extra material. This paper presents a light invariant hand gesture recognition system which would be a great impact on robust image segmentation. The presented method used a database of hand gesture images to match with test gesture. The ANN implementation gave better results and false positives were less. The results are encouraging as in two very different lighting conditions, gestures were identified correctly. The light and direction invariant methods for hand gesture recognition provide natural comfort to the user.
