In this paper, we propose a Learning with Rethinking algorithm for image recognition. The proposed algorithm feeds back posterior probability information from top layers to guide bottom layers in their feature learning. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show that the Learning with Rethinking algorithm is able to further boost the well-established models with only a few parameters introduced. Particularly, experiments on benchmark datasets MNIST-background-image and ImageNet clearly demonstrate its advantage in recognizing objects or categories with large inter-class similarity. Besides, our work also demonstrates that recurrently improving performance with feedback information is a promising direction.
