This paper proposes a novel technique to accurately detect AMD using a custom designed CNN. High classifier accuracies of 91.17% and 95.45% are obtained with the blindfold and ten-fold cross-validation strategies respectively. Furthermore, no engineered features are required for the diagnosis using fundus images. Also, the proposed model is fully autonomous therefore, it can be effortlessly applied to clinics. This proposed CAD system for AMD can serve as a second opinion tool to assist ophthalmologists in their diagnosis. It can also be installed in third world countries or in rural areas where ophthalmology care is limited.
