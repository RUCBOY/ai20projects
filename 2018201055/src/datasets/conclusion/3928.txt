The application of structured features, such as SPD matrices requires effective and efficient data clustering tools in the Riemannian framework. This paper successfully extends the framework of conscious competitive learning to the Riemannian manifold of the SPD matrices. This framework is based on the Fisher-Rao metric which is theoretically very good. In the new framework, the weights space of the neural network is Riemannian manifold, and the weights of the neural network are updated on the Riemannian manifold. We have shown that our new technique has several advantages over existing SPD matrices clustering methods. We have presented experimental results on both simulated data and real world applications and have demonstrated the good performance of the proposed algorithm.
