We found a greater prevalence of overweight/obesity in peri-urban schoolchildren than their urban counterparts, corresponding to lower parental education attainment. Peri-urban schoolchildren spent significantly less time on homework/reading and more time on television screening and computer use than their urban peers. This finding highlights a concern of family inequality over schoolchildren between peri-urban and urban regions in Taipei metropolitan area. Time spent on homework/reading is not an apparent contributor to overweight/obesity prevalence among schoolchildren.
