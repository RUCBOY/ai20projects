The TFM analysis method helps identify function distribution and identify trends in technological evolution. The ontology-based eTFM methodology presented is generic, although this paper focuses on demonstrating and validating the methodology being applied in the CPS TFM construction domain. Our recent research emphasizes the importance of analyzing techno-functional trends using ontology-based eTFM for intelligent and dynamic analyses of techno-functional trends in dental 3D printing and immersive technology. The eTFM methodology was not fully described in these preliminary research articles [7] [20]. The key contribution of this research is to develop the ontology-based eTFM as a generic TFM construction method. A comparative validation is also presented in Section 4 using the CPS case experiments that demonstrates the eTFM's consistent and reliable application. The only prerequisite for eTFM generation is a domain ontology which requires some manual effort to group. Since the domain ontology is a critical part of the eTFM construction, researchers must review the accuracy of the ontology. Future research will focus on automatic construction and validation of the ontology.
