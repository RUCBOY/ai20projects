In this study, we have created a model describing the spread of oil pollution on the sea surface. It enables the main processes occurring during such a disaster - advection, emulsification, evaporation and natural dispersion to be created, as well as interaction with different types of shoreline. This model is based on the discretization of the simulated matter (Lagrangian discrete particle algorithm). It also uses methodologies familiar with the Cellular Automata approach. The combination of these two methods is innovative and allows to obtain more accurate results. An important advantage of the model is the possibility of taking into account inhomogeneities in space and the instability at the time of the atmospheric conditions. Another benefit is the determination of the state of oil both globally (slick taken as a whole) and locally (in a specific place). Using this model we have developed a computer program allowing users to perform simulations of the studied phenomena. This program provides an easy way to set the initial conditions, influence the course of the simulation (e.g. by changing weather conditions) and visualization of the obtained results. The outcomes of the conducted simulations were compared with other theoretical and experimental data. The good agreement received proved the usefulness of our approach.
