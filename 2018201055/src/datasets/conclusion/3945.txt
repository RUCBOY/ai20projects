Nowadays, energy efficiency and performance are the main points of focus of System-on-Chip design. Despite numerous efforts, power consumption remains the major limitation in recent mobile processors. In this paper, we leverage GPGPU techniques on mobile devices and combine them with the flexibility and accuracy of the CPU. This collaborative approach achieves a level of performance per watt on mobile devices that is not achievable by existing mobile CPUs. It is a challenging problem to achieve high performance and responsiveness on mobile devices. Nevertheless, our CPU–GPU collaborative method provides excellent speedup within the same power envelope when compared with traditional CPU or GPU implementation.
Our work exploits this new computing architecture to push the frontier of data analysis away from centralized servers to performing this computation at the source of the data, i.e. the mobile device. Our analysis shows that such an approach is promising. In this paper, the focus has been on a PCA-based collaborative CPU–GPU method. The proposed principles are general and can therefore be applied to any machine learning method under the assumptions described in this paper. The advent of a new generation of mobile SoCs unleashes mobile device computing capability to tackle challenges on a larger scale, and our proposed collaborative approach can exploit this new computational power much more efficiently in a CPU/GPU environment.
