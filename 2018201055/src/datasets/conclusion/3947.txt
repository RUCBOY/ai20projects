The research allowed the formulation of the following final conclusions:
•Comparison of the two methods, optical and microscopy, shows that the degree of enlargement of the particle powders affects the recognition of the image. As a result, it can impact the classification of qualitative groups. The use of Laws textures in processing operations and digital image analysis techniques, as well as the method of artificial neural networks allowed the effective recognition of the class research material, ie. spray dried strawberry juice with varying quality (color, particle size, texture). The use of texture GLCM in neural image analysis and scanning electron microscopy allowed the adequate classify of the research material.•The qualitative analysis demonstrated that the adequate neural model which obtained the highest classification capability reached a network of MLP.•Analysis of PCA to input variables for MLP 9:9-9-4:1 demonstrated that the most important variable in images using scanning electron microscopy technique was the component for Feret factor which impact to recognition size of the particles. In fact it can identify these classes spray dried strawberry juice. In PCA to input variables for MLP 12:12-1-4:1 demonstrated that the most important variable was the component for energy in GLCM matrix which impact to operation of electron beam of the particles too. In fact, it can define a qualitative level spray dried strawberry juice. In PCA to input variables for MLP 30:30-19-4:1 demonstrated that the most important variables in computer image analysis by using an optical technique were the components for generate by Laws texture, which impact to quality of neural model. In fact, this ANN reached an RMS error value of 0.03.
