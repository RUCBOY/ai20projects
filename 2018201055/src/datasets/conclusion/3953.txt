In this work, a contour-aware network for semantic segmentation via adaptive depth is proposed. Firstly, a basic semantic segmentation model is introduced. Specifically, pyramid CNN is built for feature representation and fully connected CRF is constructed to model the relationships between nearby samples. The final decisions for pyramid results are made from sparse learning. Secondly, the semantic segmentation neural network via adaptive depth is described in detail and two advantages are claimed. One is alleviating the unbalanced problem in training and the other one is the model can adaptively determine the forward procedure in testing. Thirdly, a contour-aware neural network is proposed and it can efficiently alleviate the ambiguousness of semantic regions. Moreover, global inference of the final semantic label is proposed through global energy minimization.
Three contributions are claimed in this work. Firstly, a semantic segmentation neural network via adaptive depth is proposed. Secondly, contour-aware network is built for semantic segmentation. Thirdly, global inference for the final semantic segmentation is introduced. Experiments are conducted on three popular datasets and several state-of-the-art methods are served as competitors. The quantitative and qualitative results verified the superiority of the proposed method.
