A fully automated liver lesions detection system is proposed in this work to assist radiologists in a reliable diagnosis of liver lesions. Given the good diagnostic accuracy obtained without any segmentation of ROI, this system has the potential to be utilized in clinics and hospitals to serve as a supporting tool in the evaluation of liver lesions in almost real-time. Hence, it will reduce the workload of the radiologists as they do not need to manually segment the ROI. Further, the proposed algorithm can also be extended to identify the different stages of liver fibrosis.
