This paper proposed a hybrid method based on couple lattice map and modified genetic algorithm for medical image encryption. Initial population in modified genetic algorithm was generated with couple lattice map. This improved the quality of cipher images and also increased the resistance of the proposed method against attacks. The other important achievement of the proposed method was its considerable fast execution time in comparison with other evolutionary algorithm-based image encryption methods. This happened because of the approach which was used for designing the GA. Finally, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm has quite good performance in medical image encryption. The results also show that the proposed method is outstanding in decreasing execution time of image encryption.
