When considering the many steps in the digital dental workflow, it can be concluded that digital imaging is one of the crucial steps in this process. Not only is it necessary for clinicians to understand the technological parameters of digital images, but it is as important to be able to manipulate these digital datasets and have knowledge on the possible pitfalls in the digital chain. While 3D low dose volumetric CBCT imaging and 3D intraoral optical impressions are rapidly becoming implemented in general dental practice, new applications for follow-up offer new potential in the maintenance of our patients.
