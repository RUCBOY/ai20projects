We propose a novel deep learning method called BN3 for P300 signal detection. Our method is fully data-driven while achieving the state-of-art character recognition performance by capturing subject-specific spatio-temporal features. In particular, under the settings where the number of the flashing epochs is small, our method achieves the best performance among the compared approaches. Compared with the standard CNN, our model is less susceptible to overfitting and training is faster. As a result, our method can be used to enhance P300 spellers. Since our method does not make specific assumptions regarding P300, it can also be employed as a general framework to all types of event-related potentials.
Despite the encouraging performance of BN3, visualization of the features in the intermediate layers in the network is presented. This is essential for gaining more insight into the internal operation and behavior of the network. Future work will be conducted to study the outputs of the intermediate layers by using recently proposed visualization techniques.
