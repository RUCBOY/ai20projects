In this paper, we investigate a promising approach based on convolutional neural networks with local binary patterns for source camera model identification, which achieves better performance compared to the-state-of-art methods tested on the same dataset. In particular, the LBP coding operation exerts a significant effect on promoting the performance and it indicates that a well-designed CNNs structure with smart preprocessing hint can be an excellent tool for image forensics problems especially for camera identification. In the future, it is prospective for deep learning approaches to perform much better than the classical methods through more careful CNNs structure designing especially the preprocessing hint and better parameter tuning. And we will attempt to investigate smarter hints for CNNs continuously.
