The synthetic results show that TG-RTM gets better image quality in locating the reflectors than RTM based on cross-correlation imaging condition. RTM using PSTD needs only two PPWs in spatial sampling density, thus it can save much memory and computation time than RTM using the traditional high order FDTD method. Therefore, RTM using PSTD is appropriate to run on GPU in that it can image much larger problems by using the same memory. RTM using PSTD can be highly parallelized by GPU. We implement and accelerate the new RTM method on a Tesla K20Xm GPU card and get a speedup of about 80 times. The proposed RTM obtains a higher speed-up ratio and faster computation speed than on 64 CPU cores in an IBM server, whose price is 10 times more than that of the GPU card. Thus, the proposed RTM is fast and inexpensive. After applying the new RTM to 3D velocity models, we verify that the new RTM can get a high quality image with a low sampling density, compared with RTM using FDTD.
