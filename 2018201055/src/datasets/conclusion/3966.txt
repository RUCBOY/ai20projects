For texture enhancement in gray scale and colour images, the G-L fractional differential operator is modified using the fact that large amount of autocorrelation exists between pixels in local neighborhoods. The filter coefficients that are zero in the basic G-L FD filter are made non-zero by distributing the autocorrelation feature across pixels in a neighborhood. The modified FD operator is applied to textured images; texture enhancement is obtained and compared with histogram equalization, basic G-L FD operator and adaptive FD operator. The experiments by visual analysis proved that the proposed operator is able to provide better enhancement than the basic G-L FD filter.
As can be seen from the analysis shown in Table 22, it is concluded that the modified G-L FD operator outperforms the basic G-L FD operator. It is also noted that the rate at which these measures attain their improvement (either increasingly or decreasingly) by the increase in FD order is appreciably higher with the modified G-L FD operator than with the basic G-L FD operator. The optimum value fractional order v is found to lie in the range 0.5â€“0.7.
Our proposed solution is demonstrated in enhancing the textural details carrying vital information in different types of images such as remote sensing images and medical images. In future, it is planned to use this operator for pre-processing step for image segmentation. In our proposed approach, the optimum value for the FD order is obtained by experiments. In future, the proposed method will be extended to make the fractional order adaptive one.
