In this paper, a dual-frequency fringe projection measurement method based on correction of gamma nonlinearity of projector is proposed. In contrast to the dual-frequency fringe projection measurement method without correction of gamma nonlinearity of projector, the measurement accuracy is increased. It is shown that for the object with abrupt change of height such as steep object, the proposed method has advantages over the conventional methods. The computer simulation and experimental work have validated the robustness and effective of the proposed method.
