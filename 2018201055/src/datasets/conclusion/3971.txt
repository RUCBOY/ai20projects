For the task of facial attribute classification, we have presented a novel method, termed FMTNet, which consists of three different sub-networks – FNet, MNet and TNet – for face detection, multi-label learning and transfer learning, respectively. MNet in FMTNet predicts multiple facial attributes simultaneously for the labelled facial attributes. Moreover, MNet reduces feature redundancy with the proposed loss weight scheme, resulting in significant performance improvements. Based on MNet, TNet in FMTNet predicts facial attributes with unlabelled information by using MK-MMD. The proposed method, which combines multi-label learning with transfer learning, is general and can be applied to other computer vision tasks.
