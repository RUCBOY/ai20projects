This study has followed a group of preschool children as they, in a range of learning activities, explore a concept over 7 weeks. Following Conezio & French (2002) who point to the role of science activities in preschool children's language learning, this study can at least illustrate how language learning and perception of concepts are intertwined in preschool activities, together with the scaffolding potential of artifacts. With Roth & Lawless (2002) the study points to a movement towards increasingly verbally explicit explanations unfolding as the project develops, while at the same time, these explanations are seen to be coupled with other means in children's exploration.
It could be argued that this is the place where the dynamic between “spontaneous” and ‘scientific’ concepts (Vygotsky, 1986) is in action. This is shown to be harnessed by the teachers in this project, who rearrange the settings artifacts and employ activities to work with the ever-changing needs of the children. What this study may suggest, is that a closer look at what accounts for knowledge display for preschool children that includes all sorts of means of expression, may in turn be of use for teachers in promoting new learning opportunities. This also calls for more research exploring different mediational means in preschool children's conceptual development, and the ways in which activities and artifacts are worked as fundamental resources for children's present and potential ways of understanding the world around them.
