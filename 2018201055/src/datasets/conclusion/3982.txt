This article provides a clear and constructive exposition for the confidence interval estimation of the range of agreement with the following four emphases. First, the fundamental features and technical differences are thoroughly presented for the recommended equal-tailed tolerance intervals and the outer confidence limits of the exact individual confidence intervals of the two limits of agreement. Second, the absolute accuracy of the suggested exact interval approach, the delicate nature of the outer individual confidence limits, and the undesirable properties of the currently suggested methods in Refs. [6] and [19] are demonstrated with definite numerical evidence. Third, to facilitate design planning of method comparison studies, sample size procedures for precise interval estimation of the range of agreement are presented under the expected half-width and assurance probability principles that have not been considered in the context of tolerance interval estimation. Fourth, the lack of proper computer software certainly impedes the use of the proposed confidence interval and sample size procedures. Accordingly, both SAS/IML and R algorithms are available to resolve the computational issues in practical applications.
