Copy-move forgery is the most popular image manipulation technique in which image regions are duplicated within themselves. The proposed work focused on detection of copy-move forgery by integrating the conventional block-based and keypoint based techniques. Image keypoints can be used to detect the matching regions of an image. The proposed method used the Binary Discriminant Features to extract the keypoints and identify the matching points. The descriptor being binary and of low dimension, reduces the complexity of feature matching. SLIC superpixels replace the matching points so as to give an indication of the suspected forged regions and then a Forgery Region Localization algorithm extracts the forged regions, using color histogram matching. A final morphological close operation obtains the detected forged region.
Experimental analysis proved the effectiveness of the proposed method in copy-move forgery detection. The method offers higher detection and accuracy rates. It has shown remarkable improvement in precision and F1 Score values when compared to the other state-of-the-art algorithms. It has also shown fairly good results for recall rate. It detects both single copy-move forgery and multiple copy-move forgery. Several post-processing operations are being done on the cloned images in order to deceive the forgery detection algorithms. The proposed method has been proved to be robust against several post-processing operations like brightness changes, contrast adjustments, color reduction and image blurring. It outperforms the existing methods in the presence of such post-processing operations. The method eliminates the use of experimental thresholds for feature matching and also has a very low false matching rate which is evident from the higher precision rates. Future works would focus on improving the accuracy of region localization and also on extending the method to detect other kinds of image forgery.
