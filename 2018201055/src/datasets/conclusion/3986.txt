The head pose estimation has become a broader area of research as the application of the head pose estimation demands for analyzing the behavior and conveying the information accurately. In the basic initialization phase an image is referenced as the signature image for performing the classification task. The proposed method performs estimation of the orientation of the head for identifying the pose reflecting the expression and behavior. The human behavior capture from the images is communicating messages for a particular subject. The method is demonstrated on several datasets with the ground truth. The obtained experimental result shows that the proposed method performs better with recognition accuracy.
