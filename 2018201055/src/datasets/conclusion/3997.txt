Although UOV with the suitable parameters is secure against traditional computer attacks and quantum computer attacks, the implementations of UOV, especially implementations on IoTs, are susceptible to side channel attacks. Analysis of hardware security for UOV implementations for IoTs is very crucial. We present an efficient algorithm based on side channel analysis of UOV which has a security level of not smaller than 80 bits. We implement UOV signature schemes on Sakura-G FPGA board via using Verilog-HDL code and Xilinx ISE software. The power collection uses a 350 MHz Keysights oscilloscope (DSOX3034T). Based on the experimental results, we successfully recover all the secret keys of UOV signature. We should protect UOV and related signatures against side channel attacks with suitable countermeasures when they are adopted in cloud-based IoTs.
