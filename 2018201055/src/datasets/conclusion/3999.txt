As both neuro-technology and our understanding of learning in neurons advance, the possible applications for a neurocomputer will grow. Trained neuronal cultures could potentially solve certain traditionally non-computable problems and aid in the areas such as pattern recognition and filtering. Combining cultures with traditional computers allows a dimension of computing utilizing biological neural circuits and learning that neither system can achieve on its own. If the technology of neuronal cultures and MEAs can be improved, more advantages of the hybrid system can be discovered.
Although the field is young, there is significant room for growth. With better techniques to design neuronâ€“silicon interfaces and biological circuits, improved ease and reliability in maintenance of these networks, and more innovative stimulation protocol, researchers can better understand the properties of neurocomputers and design them to solve new problems. The research demonstrated in recent literature proves that the topic needs much more work, but even such preliminary testing shows that the future of neurocomputing holds promise.
