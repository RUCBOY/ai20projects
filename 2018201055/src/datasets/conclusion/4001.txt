The use of the paper AR of a conference is not a trustworthy metric in order to evaluate the potential of a researcher's contribution in his/her field through the quality of the venue. The PR metric, proposed by Nelakuditi et al., is a rough coarse-grain metric proposed for making quick assessments of a researcher's contribution. Although PR is an idea towards the right direction in our view, it has some important limitations which we pointed out in recent work. In this work we try to overcome these limitations by proposing a new, finer-grain conference classification approach. By using four different metrics, associated with the authors of each paper in a conference as well as the influence of the paper on the scientific community, we are able to cluster well-known Computer Science conferences in different quality categories.
Our future work will include the use of CCA for evaluating a larger number of conferences. We also intend to implement CCA on conferences outside the Computer Science field and to further explore the issue that we touched upon in our earlier work (Loizides & Koutsakis, 2013), of how the location of a conference may influence its selectivity.
We believe that CCA can offer a better and more complete (thus fairer) method for judging the quality of the venue where an author publishes his/her work. Furthermore, with this new approach each conference can make its annual self-evaluation and draw useful conclusions from the gathered data over time. We hope that our approach can bring a fresh look into the current conference evaluation system.
