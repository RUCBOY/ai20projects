To conclude, different teacher enactments in fact presented different combinations of pedagogical features. Therefore, viewing teaching practices from multiple perspectives and on a continuum rather than as partitioned ideas (Holliday, 2004) helps us to better understand the learning space that is open to students, and how these teaching practices might impact student science learning. The two-dimensional framework proposed in this study offers a structural frame for analyzing and understanding teachers' enactments of computer-based inquiry curricula from multiple perspectives. Although the two teachers in the study did not show a dramatic shift from traditional to inquiry-based teaching in the computer-based environment, the results of the data analysis demonstrated that examining teachersâ€™ enactments based on the proposed framework helps to distinguish different teaching patterns and to understand teaching practices in a more holistic way. We acknowledge that the study only involved two cases, so the teaching strategies in terms of the categories identified are limited and are closely bound to the contexts. For future research, it is suggested that researchers identify more teaching approaches used by teachers, further analyze how teachers decide when to use which approach during a lesson or a series of lessons, and study how to better shape effective classroom inquiry norms in computer-based learning environments.
