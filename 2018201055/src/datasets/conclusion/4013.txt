This study of undergraduate students in Saudi Arabia found that although they used technology for an average of 45 h per week and had positive attitudes to it, they did not frequently use technology in support of their learning. Qualitative evidence suggests that the students were not routinely required to use computers at university, and indeed that in some cases the universities did not provide computing facilities or actively prevented technology usage. Saudi Arabian universities have an opportunity to harness technology to aid teaching and learning within the university curriculum by capitalising on their students’ positive attitudes to technology, and their experience of using computers out-with university. However, because some students lack technological confidence and skills, it would be beneficial to ensure that all students are supported in learning how to use technology effectively for studying, especially if they lack experience, or have not had parental encouragement. This is particularly important in the universities in small cities, where further efforts to address the rural-urban divide may be necessary. As lack of English language proficiency is a factor related to more negative attitudes (such as low confidence or anxiety), it would be helpful either to provide online learning materials in Arabic, or to provide additional English language support. We also recommend that advantage be taken of the very wide use of smart phones across KSA society, to bring the educational benefits of learning technology to those who lack access to more substantial fixed computer facilities. This would require investment in support to ensure that on-line educational resources are provided on small mobile devices in a manner appropriate to their technologies (i.e. restricted displays, keyboards and battery life), while still consistent with the full scale versions.
