After the investigation of the existed methods, the textural difference between the residual images of NIs and CGs and the fitting degree of the multiple linear regression models are analyzed. It is found that the residual texture of NIs is more complex than that of CGs. Based on this principle, histogram features and multi-fractal features of the residual image are extracted to represent the differences. Moreover, the difference between the fitting degree to the regression model of NIs and CGs is investigated and it is found that the fitting degree of NIs is better than that of CGs. Hence, the regression model fitness features are extracted. Experimental results and analysis show that it can achieve an average identification accuracy of 98.69% with only 24 dimensions of features, and it is robust against JPEG compression, rotation, additive noise and reduction of image size. It has great potential to be implemented for the identification of NIs and CGs.
