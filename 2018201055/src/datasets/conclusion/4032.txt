The proposed framework identifies the individual, model or brand of the transmitting computer devices from recorded VoIP calls for forensic investigation. We have captured device specific influences and eliminated contaminating influences such as speech and environment through developing a control system model and mathematical modelling of the device response function. This shows entropy-MFCCs capture the computer device response function from near-silent segments. Our study provides the framework for future investigations to assess the performance for practical audio forensic cases. Nevertheless, data collection and test setup remain in lab conditions as described in Section 3.2.2, which are away from real case scenarios. Future work should focus on collecting large call recording dataset from different models and brands of computer devices for automatic source computer device identification using open set classifier. The framework can be applied to a wide range of audio forensic scenarios such as audio forgery detection and crime investigation.
