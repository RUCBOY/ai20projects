The authors establish an optimization process of quantity of components for digital human-computer interface based on human reliability, utilize fuzzy method to form fuzzy segments for quantity of components of the same factor, propose a quick convergence search method to search for fuzzy segments and an affinity error probability mapping function to calculate human error probability in monitoring process. Experiments are conducted by authors according to the proposed methods. The experimental results show that the affinity error probability function has high sensitivity and stabilization, quick convergence search method is more superiority than common method. Finally, the optimal quantity of components for each part of main human-computer interface of spurious safety injection event of a NPP is obtained.
On the other hand, this research has some limitations, for example, (1) only a few important factors in this paper are analyzed, we will add some influencing factors as next study plan; (2) the value acquisition of λ and δ in affinity error probability function is partly based on our previous experiments, in future the values will be improved by real simulated experiment of a Npp; (3) the proposed methods will further be applied to other fields by adjusting parameters.
