In this paper, we presented our detailed experiences of integrating PDC topics with the various courses taught to undergraduate students of Computer Science and Engineering. The detailed integration plan, motivation, related works, course structure, evaluation plan, students’ feedback, statistical analysis, and observations were discussed. From the observations and students’ feedback, the success of the presented integration method is reported. From the reported works, it was seen that the NSF/TCPP early adopter initiative has encouraged the faculty to take up the activity of integration of PDC topics in various courses. It is felt that the TCPP core curriculum document is a fruitful guide in this direction that proves to be very helpful in integration of PDC topics with other courses. We observed that the students like to learn this area and are especially interested in its programming aspects.
