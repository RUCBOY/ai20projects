This discussion is meant to be a critical piece. The quality of the contributions to this special issue speak for itself, and there is no need to praise them any further here. Nevertheless, there is a need to point out that the field suffers from some blind spots, and that much work remains to be done. There is arguably a rather broad agreement that the field of CBA is both an important and an interesting one, but its current state could be compared to complicated neuro-degenerative diseases such as dementia: While medical scientists slowly begin to understand the underlying mechanisms, there is hardly anything that can be done at bedside. Similarly, scientists – and this special issue is a great example of this current state – begin to understand the mechanisms and the potential underlying CBA, but broader applications and larger exploitation are still some distance away. This, however, is by no means meant as a discouragement but rather an encouragement to the field, and some big leaps as well as steady development are likely to continue throughout the near future. We conclude with the hope that this special issue serves as food for thought and inspiration to you and your research, both in terms of which important knowledge has already been established and which areas deserve further attention.
