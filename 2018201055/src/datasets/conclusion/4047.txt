People spend considerable amount of time playing games. The OSS computer games are freely available; therefore, people try many games. Quality has been a key concern in OSS development environment. Previous studies claim varying conclusions about the quality of OSS applications, whereas, findings about the quality of OSS computer game applications are sporadic, especially using the quantitative data analysis of the internal attributes of the applications. This study investigates the quality concerns of the design complexity of methods in OSS computer game application by collecting and analyzing data about three quality criteria of correctness, reliability and maintainability. We conclude that the methods of the OSS computer game applications demonstrate an acceptable level of quality in the three criteria of correctness, reliability and maintainability. Extending this work to evaluate various quality factors at the class level using well-known software quality metrics is a part of our future work.
