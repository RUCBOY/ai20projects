This study examined the relationship between computer self-efficacy and learning performance and investigated learning engagement as a mediator of this relationship. Studying 121 individuals in their late-middle and old years learning in computer cram schools for the purpose of seeking a job to support their long-term living, we found that these students' computer self-efficacy contributes to their learning engagement and, in turn, their learning performance. This study used a sample that has not yet been investigated in the literature but has become increasingly important given today's social issues and theoretically and empirically supported the recently developed and critical concept of work engagement by finding that personal resources (e.g., self-efficacy) contribute to individuals' work engagement level and, in turn, their job performance. Practitioners (e.g., directors and lecturers of the computer cram schools) can consider the findings as an important reference for improving elder students' (e.g., late-middle-aged and old students') learning performance by building their computer self-efficacy and learning engagement.
