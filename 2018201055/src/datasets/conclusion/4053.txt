In this paper we described a master-level course on computer clusters. The course has been developed around four keystones. Firstly, a hands-on but in deep design, trying to bring the course contents closer to the professional practice as it is widely recommended (for instance by the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery in their last Computing Engineering Curricula). Secondly, it deals with the main concepts of all types of computer cluster usage, including the ones that are not usually covered in most cluster-related courses in other universities but widely used in companies, i.e., High-Availability/High-Performance Service clusters. Thirdly, the course relies on virtualization (and Linux operating system) to allow every student to develop his/her own cluster without interfering with the work of other students. Fourthly, despite the small size of the implemented cluster, every step of the process is designed to be scalable, by thinking about a large cluster.
Both authors have taught the course for several years. The student assessment results are overall very good. Indeed, the student satisfaction at the end of the course is very high, as shown by the results of surveys conducted by the university.
Finally, all the contents of the course have been exposed in detail so that it can provide guidance to other teachers interested in using this approach.
