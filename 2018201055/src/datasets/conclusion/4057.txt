The aim of this paper is to assess the number of jobs which are threatened to be performed by computer technology in Japan in the near future. Relying on machine learning method, our findings suggest that 55% of actual jobs in Japan could be considered to be at risk. We also found that non-regular workers are more threatened than regular workers.
These results are based on technical background, and other economic and social determinants are necessary to draw a clear picture of the future automation as the relative cost of labor and computer capital or the social acceptation of producers and consumers. Overall, the current development in computer technology, the decline in the working population, or the support in ICT development by public authorities, firms and universities suggest that computer technology could strongly reshape the Japanese labor market and production activities.
