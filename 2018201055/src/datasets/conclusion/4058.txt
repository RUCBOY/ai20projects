The capacity for SDL is known to influence learning. Our findings have extended previous research by examining the relations of each of the three SDL factors to benefit us by identifying which SDL factor best predicts certain outcomes. Desire for learning was found to be the strongest influential factor affecting university students' use of computers for SDL. Pedagogical ideas to promote SDL, particularly desire for learning, through computer technology need to be further explored and tested. Whatever pedagogy is chosen, course developers and instructors are responsible for searching the most appropriate way to implement it in their own teaching contexts. Further investigations into the interactions and relationships between the three constructs, the selected pedagogy, the context, and individual learnersâ€™ learning and personal factors are deemed necessary.
