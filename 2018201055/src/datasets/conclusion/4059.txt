From a TML perspective, how does technology enhance learning? More importantly, technological features directly relevant to instructional and learning processes must be conceptualized (Alavi & Leidner, 2001). Computer-based graduated prompting assessment was originally designed to alleviate bottlenecks associated with the learning process. Thus, based on TML, the current study developed and used growth model analysis to understand the influence of computer-based graduated prompting assessment on students’ academic performance in a longitudinal timeframe. To understand the longitudinal effect of the assessment system, the growth model analysis of HLM (Hox, 2010, Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002) was adopted.
This study contributes to theory and practice in three ways. First, the TML-based assessment was developed and tracked because the assessment system has become the dominant mode for communicating with learners, which assumes that learners learn best in isolated TML environments. Second, the study was longitudinal. Longitudinal data were examined across eight time periods to understand the influence of graduated prompting assessment on students’ academic performance. Third, quasi-experiments were used to test the derived hypotheses.
