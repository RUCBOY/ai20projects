We conducted a trial to establish if a full-scale evaluation of Drive Smart is feasible and potentially worthwhile. The findings suggest that the hazard perception skills of participants improved following Drive Smart driver training, and were in part maintained. We found a large effect size for the immediate training effect, consistent with one prior study. These data suggest a full-scale trial is worthwhile and feasible with further modification of the method.
