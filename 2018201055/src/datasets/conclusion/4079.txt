The field of BCI is one of the important fields that deals with brain activities. It is expected that BCI applications will have great effect on our daily life. To extend the work in this field, this paper is one of the three survey papers towards simplifying the field and providing state-of-the-art to the reader. This paper focuses on defining the BCI. It also classifies and compares the brain signals. In addition, it surveys the current BCI hardware and software. Moreover, it explains the current challenges of the field. Nevertheless, it draws some road maps for the future of BCI. The second paper will be an extensive survey on the current techniques and algorithms used for BCI while the third paper will discuss the current applications of BCI and their impacts on the society.
