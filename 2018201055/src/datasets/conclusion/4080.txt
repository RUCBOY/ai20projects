5.1. Implications of the findingsBased on results of this study and previous studies, strain factors (perceived stress and bullying victimization), and internal control (self-control) appear more important than external control factors (e.g. parental attachment and supervision) in explaining cyber delinquency (Bae, 2016). In addition, researchers need to consider community involvement and control as well as parental affection and supervision as social control factors to better understand cyber delinquency.
5.2. Limitations and suggestions of future researchThe limitations of this study are as follows. First, the inventories used in assessing the external control factors have few items, which might decrease their validity. Fortunately, based on factor analysis, the construct validity of the inventories used in measuring parental attachment and supervision, and community attachment and supervision seem to be quite satisfactory. In future studies, researchers need to use other valid inventories to compare the effects of external factors and other variables on cyber delinquency. Second, I only included conflicts with parents and peers, appearance stress, academic stress, and offline bullying victimization as strain factors in this study. Thus, in future studies, researchers need to consider more strain factors such as school, resources, and so on. Third, Adolescents can overestimate their self-control ability in self-report questionnaires, and can underreport offline bullying victimization and cyber delinquency. Therefore, in future studies, it is necessary to include evaluation of parent or teacher and objective record in order to supplement these measurement methods. Finally, this study did not consider other important factors (e.g., computer literacy, peer-pressure) for cyber delinquency, and a finer classification of cyber delinquency would be important to understand the phenomenon better. Future studies will need to supplement these limitations.
