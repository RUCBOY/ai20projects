The results of the present study have indicated that mediating effects of the three CMC components occur in the relationships between four of the five personality traits and attitude toward Facebook. Without CMC skill, CMC knowledge and CMC motivation, there is no significant relationship between the neuroticism personality trait and attitude toward Facebook. In other words, the three CMC components are significant mediators which establish the relationship between neuroticism and attitude toward Facebook; increase the positive causal relationship between extraversion and openness to experience with attitude toward Facebook; and reduce the negative causal relationship between conscientiousness and attitude toward Facebook. The final model (see Fig. 1) derived from the present study can be used as an alternative in explaining the previous findings on the relationships between personality traits and attitude toward Facebook.
The present study indicates that a total of 76% of variance of attitude toward Facebook is predicted by the four personality traits and the three CMC components (Fig. 1). Another 24% of variance is unpredicted. Therefore, future studies can include other personal characteristics, such as self-efficacy, shyness, individualism, loneliness, anxiety and narcissism. As suggested by some scholars (Clayton et al., 2013, Morahan-Martin and Schumacher, 2003, Ong et al., 2011, Whitty and McLaughlin, 2007), these personality characteristics influence Facebook use. Studying the influence of these personality characteristics could further contribute to the body of knowledge in this field and provide a bigger picture of the relationship between personality factors and attitude toward Facebook.
Finally, future studies can include multiple types of SNSs which cuts across multiple platforms and ultimately makes a stronger contribution to our understandings of the relationship between personality and attitude toward SNSs.
