This study helps to better understand the hedonic benefits of computer-mediated social exchange and highlights the fact that the enjoyment derived from social interaction as mediated by CMSN provides an incentive for individuals to ignore privacy concerns and to act contrary to their best interests. Using social exchange theory as the theoretical background for our investigation, we identify the antecedents and consequences of computer-mediated social exchange. We identify three dimensions of social capital, namely bridging social capital, bonding social capital and maintained social capital as antecedents to computer-mediated social exchange characterized by the social exchange behaviors of altruism, group gain, reciprocity, and status consistency. Results of our study show that social exchange behavior on computer-mediated social networks (CMSN) lead to hedonic benefits in using those CMSN. We also found that the enjoyment received from this social exchange is sufficient to override many privacy concerns. This reduction in privacy concerns explains continued use of CMSN in the presence of legitimate user concerns over information privacy.
