In conclusion, an accommodation-convergence-conflict-free 3D display on the computer screen is realized and demonstrated experimentally. Through projecting two perspective views to each eye of the viewer by sequentially gated light valves, two light beams passing through a target spatial spot converge into a real light spot that the corresponding eye can focus on naturally. Since computers have deeply entered into our daily life, the proposed 3D display technique will have excellent market prospects.
