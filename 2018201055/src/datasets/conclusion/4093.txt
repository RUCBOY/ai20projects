Implementing an optimising solver is generally a long and expensive process. Therefore, it is imperative to have a reliable estimate of the achievable peak performance, FLOPS, of an algorithm at both the design and optimised implementation stages of development.
The roofline model provides a readily understandable graphical tool, even for a non-specialist, to quickly assess and evaluate the computational effectiveness of a particular implementation of an algorithm. We have shown how the roofline model can be applied to finite-difference discretizations of the wave-equation commonly used in the geophysics community. Although the model is quite simple, it provides a reliable estimate of the peak performance achievable by a given finite-difference discretization regardless of the implementation. Not only does this aid the algorithm designer to decide between different discretization options but also gives solver developers an absolute measure of the optimality of a given implementation. The roofline model has also proved extremely useful in guiding further optimization strategies, since it highlights the limitations of a particular version of the code, and gives an indication of whether memory bandwidth optimisations, such as loop blocking techniques, or FLOPs optimisations, such as SIMD vectorization, are likely to improve results.
However, one should always be mindful of the fact that it does not provide a complete measure of performance and should be complemented with other metrics, such as time to solution or strong scaling metrics, to establish a full understanding of the achieved performance of a particular algorithmic choice and implementation.
