The proposed CVS showed to be a viable alternative compared to traditional assessment of meat marbling, since it is capable to reduce the dependence on human experts and mitigates problems of panellists evaluation by few labelled samples.
Our CVS obtains marbling meat score by an objective and fast assessment, since machines can evaluate multiple images with no pause. This implies also lower costs in comparison to panellists, who need training and require much longer times to perform the same task. This alternative is suitable to production lines in slaughterhouses, and does not require that the images are acquired within a controlled environment.
Panellists are more susceptible to misclassification due to low marbling levels or variability of fat distribution. The proposed approach performs marbling identification and score prediction in different scenarios (low or high marbling level; dark or pale muscles) based on a ML algorithm.
A variety of research works dealing with similar tasks applied the SVM or the ANN algorithms, but for these algorithms the proper selection of the model parameters is not a trivial task, and commonly is strictly related to the specific problem at hand. Alternatively, looking for a simpler solution, we investigated the use of K-NN and achieved good results for two different muscle foods (pork and beef), also using a limited number of samples during the modelling step with respect to similar approaches already reported in the literature. In fact, the results reported in the present work demonstrated that the k-NN approach can correctly identify marbling score using few samples of each grade.
Further research work is currently aimed at verifying the device independence of the proposed approach, by using different digital cameras and smartphones in the image acquisition step.
