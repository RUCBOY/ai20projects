This study has shown that different profiles of students' ICT use exist, therefore pointing to the fact that students do not equally exploit the opportunities offered by the almost complete availability of digital resources. Besides, as students' use of ICT varies across contexts (i.e., school-related vs. outside-of-school activities) and purposes (i.e., social communication, information exchange, study purposes, recreation), an overall high use of ICT across almost all areas of life cannot be assumed for all students. We also point out that it cannot be taken for granted that all students use ICT inside and outside of schools to the same extent, thereby acquiring digital competences similarly. In light of these results, we further conclude that it is important for researchers to consider distinguishing between subgroups of students in describing the use of ICT rather than reporting on the average ICT use for an entire sample. The findings in the current study point to the need for further research on the consequences different user profiles might have for student learning, behavior, and well-being inside and outside of school. From a teacher's perspectives, it also needs to be disentangled how knowledge about these profiles influences teaching practices in specific subjects.
We believe that by acknowledging the different patterns in students' ICT use, the teachers can rightly incorporate ICT in their pedagogical practice. Teachers will be able to identify the opportunities students could avail in order to enhance their digital competences. At the same time teachers will also be able to map the potential risks (e.g., extremely frequent ICT use outside of school without any guidance or purpose, potential risk of social isolation) thereby creating an awareness around the specific needs of students in these subgroups.
