Diabetes mellitus is a long term metabolic disorder affecting various parts of the human body. The high blood glucose level causes reduction in the blood perfusion, which may often result in diabetic foot complications. The diabetic foot is the most critical and expensive complication causing disability and impairing the quality of life. The burden of diabetic foot diseases is expected to rise in future due to the growing number of diabetic patients. Thus, an early detection of diabetic foot complication is important for effective medical treatments. In this paper, conventional foot assessment methods, infrared thermography and, CAD system analysis for the diabetic foot using infrared thermography are discussed. Indeed, the IR thermography application has been growing over the years particularly in the field of medicine due to its advantages over other methods. Various techniques for thermal image analysis are presented in this paper. Among them, asymmetric temperature analysis is commonly used technique as it is simple to implement and yielded satisfactory results in previous studies. Also, new algorithms need to be developed to overcome the drawbacks of this analysis. The continuous advances in the image processing and data mining algorithms may help to overcome the existing limitations. This may help in the early detection of diabetic foot complications, and hence, assist the clinicians to intervene early. The accuracy of the CAD system can be improved further using better nonlinear features and deep learning techniques. The developed CAD system can be introduced in clinics and healthcare institutions to assess the severity of diabetic foot complications.
