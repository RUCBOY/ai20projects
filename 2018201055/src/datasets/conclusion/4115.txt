This investigation identified gender differences in upper trapezius activation following a low-level computer task, with males demonstrating greater activation post-task. Middle and lower trapezius demonstrated increased activation post-task for both genders. There was no difference in clavicular trapezius activation following the task or between genders, though there was a decreased CT/UT ratio post-task. This significant decrease suggests an imbalance in these two trapezius subdivisions as a result of the difference mechanical demands associated with the task. Imbalances in muscle activation and activation ratios following computer work may affect total shoulder kinematics and should be further explored.
While both genders demonstrated an increase in trapezius activation post-task, males had a significantly larger increase in upper trapezius activation. This finding does not help explain why females are more susceptible to trapezius myalgia and overall neck/shoulder discomfort following computer work. Further exploration on gender differences in both muscle activation and shoulder kinematics post-computer work is necessary.
This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.
