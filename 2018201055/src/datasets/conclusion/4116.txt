This work contributed to the evaluation of Fitts’s law on individuals with and without CP who used a head mouse named ENLAZA. The participants with CP were MACS IV-V and could not access the computer with traditional pointing devices such as mice.
As expected, the movements of users without motor impairments followed Fitts’s law and we found a good correlation for at least three users with CP (dystonic, spastic and mixed). We also found a weaker correlation for a participant with dystonic CP and involuntary movements. Two users with dyskinetic CP and decremented muscular tone showed no correlation with Fitts’s law. These results encourage us to continue researching and developing new interaction techniques and facilitation algorithms towards the design of a universal interface for individuals with CP and other motion-impaired users.
