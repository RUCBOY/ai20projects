The study investigated the effect of temperature change rate on contact thermal sensation and thermal comfort. Participants found overall the lower rate of change at 0.02 °C/s was more comfortable than a surface of constant 42 °C, or a surface with alternating heat. In addition, participants’ thermal sensation of a surface with constant 42 °C declines over a period of 600 s. The study implies a potential to improve thermal comfort for tablet computers by varying the surface temperature at a low temperature change rate of 0.02 °C/s.
