In this study, the selective transformation of old computer PCBs was investigated – with a particular focus on copper (Cu), lead (Pb), tin (Sn) and antimony (Sb) – at different temperatures and using different heat treatment times.
The results indicate that by increasing the heat treatment time beyond 10 min there is only a small change in the concentration of different elements, thereby proving this is fast a thermal transformation. Two stage heat treatments can be used to generate different metal alloys from old computer PCBs. Heat treatment at 400 °C will produce a Sn-Pb based alloy which can be separated out, then by using a subsequent heat treatment at 1200 °C a Cu-Sn based alloy will form. The results also indicate that a single stage heat treatment at 900 °C can be used to produce a high value Cu-Sn based alloy, without the emission of Pb via the gas phase during thermal processing. At this temperature and due to fast thermal transformation Pb and Sb are retained as alloying elements. As consequences of this fast and selective thermal transformation e-waste can be used for producing high value Cu-based alloys. This innovative and cost-effective solution has opened up an alternative path for the recovery of valuable metal alloys from e-waste in local micro-factories, thereby potentially protecting the environment from the negative impacts of landfilling this toxic waste stream, reducing pressures on natural resources and offering manufacturers access to low cost secondary resources that would otherwise be sourced from increasingly expensive raw materials.
