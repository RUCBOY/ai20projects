This study provides the levels of APEs isomers in dust samples from three different microenvironments in South Africa. Nonylphenol ethoxylates (mono â€“ di) were the most abundant isomers and detected in all the samples indicating the prevalence of these nonionic surfactants in the indoor environment. The concentrations of these pollutants in this study were lower than the reported concentrations from the limited studies found in the literature. Human exposure assessment via dust ingestion shows the importance of these indoor microenvironments as a significant route of exposure to these contaminants. The exposure of toddlers to APEs may be of concern and more studies are needed to further understand the fate and the mechanism of release of APEs from consumer applications and products in the indoor environment.
