Results from a large scale event sampling (diary) study suggest that experience of emotion in naturally occurring, online, computer-mediated social interactions and those that take place co-presently, FtF, share a similar structure. This finding supports an emerging literature suggesting a continuum between emotional phenomena in online and the real world. However, emotion experience in online social interactions was experienced overall less positively and was deemed less satisfactory than FtF social interactions. This latter finding raises questions regarding the role of positive emotion for attunement, affiliation, entrainment and co-operation in computer mediated social interactions.
