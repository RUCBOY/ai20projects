This is the first detailed examination of the physical implications of contemporary mobile touch screen device use by young children. Current findings suggest a potential for this activity to contribute to increased musculoskeletal risk and sedentary behaviour and reduced physical activity. Therefore non-screen toy play should be encouraged and education and guidelines for parents and caretakers provided to support wise use of tablets. Given evidence of increasing use, it is important to understand the physical impacts of these new screen technologies on young children and provide young children with appropriate early life experiences in using mobile technology so they can gain the benefits without the harms.
