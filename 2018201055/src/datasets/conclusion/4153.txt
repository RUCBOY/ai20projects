To sum up, the presented study highlights the need for cooperation between health care providers and informatics and presents an example of software fulfilling the requirements of plastic surgeons in one clinical and academic center. It would be worthwhile to share the PRESsPhoto system with other plastic surgery clinics and evaluate their opinion on the system. Moreover, further research should focus on the extending functionality of the system. Support for cataloguing photographic documentation should be complemented with support for the process of treating the patient. In this context, special attention should be paid to the opportunity to cooperate with HIS systems, which may in the future be the source of patient data for the PRESsPhoto system. This could make it possible to access patients' photographs on each hospital computer, including those installed in operating rooms, which may be important for surgeons in some cases.
