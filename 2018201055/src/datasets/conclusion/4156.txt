The paper presents the computer modeling results for thermal processes with the involvement of Ca, Sr and Cs during the radioactive graphite heating in the carbon dioxide atmosphere. Temperature dependence diagrams have been obtained as the result of the modeling for the radionuclide distribution by phases in the considered system. Typical reactions and temperature intervals, in which they are observed, have been identified. Temperature intervals of the radionuclide transition from the solid oxide-salt solution to a gas phase have been found. Equilibrium constants have been calculated.
The data obtained has shown that carbon dioxide interacts both with graphite and radioactive impurities it contains. It has been shown that the cesium contained in the considered system is capable to pass to a gas phase at an equilibrium temperature of 973 K, and practically all of the strontium passes to a gas phase at an equilibrium temperature of 1373 K. Some 40% of the total calcium quantity in the system passes to a gas phase at the same temperature. The temperature for the complete transition of these three radionuclides to a gas phase is considered to be 2573 K.
