In this paper, we have presented the first virtual reality model and we have described a detailed designing pipeline of Wardenclyffe – Nikola Tesla's abandoned laboratory which had a great significance during his researches. We have developed models of over 50 single devices, as well as the whole exterior and interior based on old photographs, current sight condition and legacy of the ''Nikola Tesla Museum'' of Belgrade. Besides modelling a large number of wireframe devices, the special challenge was to make visual scripts for their materialization and functionalities. The proposed modelling and simulation is done after more than seven years of collaboration with the ''Museum of Nikola Tesla'' of Belgrade and by researching each device, from their materials to the purpose and working methods. Beside static modelling, here presented design includes dynamic animations of various devices, such as generator and compressor, or physical processes such as demonstration of three-phase rotating magnetic field. As an additional contribution to this paper, the pipeline proposes free movements through 3D virtual space without external controller, which is very important for adapting the model to 3D virtual gears, due to its significance in exhibitions of modern museums. The project had a number of promotions and over of 500,000 people have had an opportunity to get acquainted with the project within exhibitions of the “Nikola Tesla Museum” of Belgrade on 4 continents.
