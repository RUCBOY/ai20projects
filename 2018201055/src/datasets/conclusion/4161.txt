In the presented work, the texture features exhibited a good discrimination performance on the CH images. These features were HTs, LBPs, and proposed GHTs. The experimental results showed the significance of the GHT features with and without feature selection. Furthermore, the SVM classifier was found as the classifier with the best performance among other state-of-the-art classifiers using all the texture features. We elicited texture information from the images for the classification of cancerous images in abnormal and normal classes. Nevertheless, the texture descriptors have their own significance. However, the colors may also have some contribution in the detection of the cancerous regions specifically when using the CH images. In the future, it would be interesting to have design descriptors that include color information as well as the texture and shape. Moreover, because this method supports image level (binary) classification, it would be fascinating to include lesion level (multilevel) classes of abnormal regions (e.g. metaplasia and dysplasia). Though the proposed method is limited to CH images, it could be generalized by using images obtained from diverse imaging modalities under several unhealthy conditions.
