This paper applies computer vision to railway engineering systems for failure checking during rolling stock examination. A shape, position and brightness invariant level set model is proposed in this work to segment rolling parts of a bogie from high-speed video of a moving train. A single shape prior model powered level sets helps in segmenting bogie parts on multiple trains under various lighting conditions. Shape prior term distributed in lower dimension subspace provides more accurate estimate of the targeted shapes with similar pixel arrangement and high packing density. This data driven level sets in computer vision provide better rolling part segmentation for defect segmentation with non-defective shape priors. We further try to save trains by developing algorithms to classify rolling defective parts at a faster rate for quick maintenance by lessening the computation time.
