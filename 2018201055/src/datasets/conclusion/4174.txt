In this paper, a novel and practical method using a sliding comparison local segmentation algorithm was developed for detection of defects on the surface of oranges. And the stem end identification was also introduced in this study. The new algorithm has advantages of avoiding additional image lightness correction process, effectively detecting the various types of surface defects on orange, and allowing the segmentation of the smallest defects of orange surface.
Experimental work was performed using 1191 samples (images) of randomly selected oranges. The method achieved the performance rate of 93.8% successful classification stem end from defective and sound orange peels, the performance rate of 91.9% successful segmentation results on individual defects and the performance rate of 97% successful detection of defective samples. These results show that the approach studied here can be suitable for the task of orange surface defect inspection.
