The positive outcomes of symptom checkers depend on the seamless communication of medical concepts between the users and the system. The detection of HCI barriers in the user interfaces of symptom checkers is paramount to avoid providing misleading advice that may result in negative consequences for users. Testing with end-users is needed to assess how good a symptom checker is in communicating with users. However, the potential users of symptom checkers are very diverse and their interfaces typically contain a large number of different symptoms and possible execution paths. This may result in high cost when involving end-users to test the system. We have presented a method that aims to deal with those challenges in a cost-effective manner. The method allows, first, for detecting areas of the user interface that make significant contributions to technology acceptance; and, second, to analyze the causes of such contributions, limiting the use of the think-aloud procedure to significant sections of the user interface. Multivariate statistics allow for analyzing the results of remote tests performed by large samples of users, thus maximizing the coverage of the GUI. The results of the statistical analysis can be used during the second stage to determine which areas of the GUI the think-aloud procedure should be focused on to diagnose the causes of the problems found.
