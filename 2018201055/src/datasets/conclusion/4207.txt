The VTIs fabricated from ME Metglas/PZT composites are investigated by theoretical analysis, computer simulation, and complementary experiments. In the theoretical model of Metglas, the roles of material anisotropy, inductor shape anisotropy, and stress-induced anisotropy in the permeability and its tunability are analyzed. The model reveals key role of stress and predicts two stress-dependent regimes of permeability tunability. Based on the piezoelectric behavior of PZT, these two regimes are analyzed in terms of electric field and are compared with complementary experiments, where good agreement is obtained. Such comparison not only validates the theoretical model but also allows determination of relevant material and physical parameters from the experimental measurements, such as anisotropy constant and demagnetization factors. Phase field modeling is employed to perform computer simulations to further investigate the underlying domain-level mechanisms responsible for the VTI behaviors. The simulations confirm the two regimes of permeability tunability and the key role of stress-induced anisotropy. The magnetic domain structures in the two regimes are studied, which are responsible for the different permeability behaviors in the two regimes. Furthermore, the effect of internal bias stress is investigated, which can shift the critical electric field and bring the VTIs into Regime II of high tenability. The established structure-property relationship together with the elucidated domain-level mechanisms show that engineering of internal bias stress is an effective means to optimize the performance of ME Metglas/PZT composite-based VTIs.
