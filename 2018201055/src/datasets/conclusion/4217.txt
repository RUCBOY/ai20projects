In this work, the interaction energies of each interaction site in the formed complexes between ATZ and five commonly used monomers in the preparation of MIPs were evaluated. The ΔE value of the interaction between H9 from amino group of atrazine and monomers is larger compared with other interaction sites, which is the main interaction site for ATZ molecule.
The most suitable solvent for the synthesis of MIPs was selected. It is shown that among the five studied solvents, toluene is the most favorable for ATZ imprinting process, with the minimum value of ΔEsolv, besides toluene had the weakest interference in the self-assembly process between ATZ and TFMAA, and under these conditions the synthesized MIPs are more likely to have higher binding affinity and selectivity.
The computer simulation results of the selection of monomers, reaction medium and condition can be helpful to prepare ATZ-MIPs with higher binding affinity and selectivity, and also can be served as a guideline for experimental design of some new MIPs.
The computational approach used in this paper is a useful tool to select function monomers or co-monomers and solvent, and to optimize the template/monomers ratio for the preparation of MIPs, and can also be used as a routine procedure before experimental tests.
