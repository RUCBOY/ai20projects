The present study confirms what we have found in previous simulations of aqueous methanol simulations, namely that lowering the temperature in aqueous alcohol mixtures renders them near ideal as far as Kirkwood-Buff integral based concentration fluctuations are concerned. In addition, the origin of this near ideality can be traced back to the fact that water forms linear clusters, which meander through the system. It would seem that water transforms into a supra-molecular entity of chain-like aggregate in appearance. This formation suppresses the fluctuations corresponding to the distribution of water in large pockets, which are predominant at high temperatures, as is the case for aqueous tbutanol mixtures, for example. These findings demonstrate a remarkable plasticity of the water molecules under cold conditions. This type of auto-organisation of water could have appreciable consequences for the preservation of organisms and water filled materials at low temperatures.
