We proposed a tactile-based BCI using ERP. Several patterns of mechanical tactile stimulation were applied to the index fingers using two Piezo actuators. Human experiments based on the oddball paradigm were carried out. As a result, an average accuracy of 80% and 65% were obtained for experiments with 2 classes and 4 classes, respectively. A high accuracy was obtained by increasing the number of electrodes, although the stimulus interval was short. The proposed method is applicable to the third BCI instead of the traditional visual and auditory BCIs. Possible future studies can involve the investigation of the optimum position, pattern, and number of tactile stimuli to improve the discrimination accuracy.
