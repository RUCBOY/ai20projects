In this research paper, computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) techniques have been used to model and identify alternative solvents to replace hexane for residual oil extraction from PPF. In order to optimise different important physical properties and health and safety aspects, an optimisation model have been developed. Since the solvent design problem requires all relevant target properties to be optimised, a multi-objective optimisation problem is formulated. Sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the most sensitive parameters that affect the result the most. From the current study, it is found that 3,4-dimethyl-1,5-hexadiene is the best candidates for replacing hexane as an alternative solvent for the PPF residual oil extraction. Further investigation such as phase behavior study is recommended to study the solubility parameter of the alternative solvent. In addition, economic aspects of the application of alternate solvents must be conducted by taking the process conditions and alternate processes into consideration. It is also necessary to compare the various grades of recovered palm oil with the prices of the products and cost of extraction. The developed methodology can be applied for the design of solvents for food industry. This work highlighted the importance of considering safety and health aspects simultaneously with the physical properties. The developed approach can also track the abrupt changes in safety and health aspects as the physical properties change. Fuzzy optimization techniques and disjunctive programming techniques have extended in CAMD to design a solvent for food industries as well by successfully tracking the interdependencies of properties.
