In this paper, we introduced the COMP 322 introductory parallel programming course at Rice University, and discussed its structure, challenges, and guiding principles. We covered in detail two particularly useful tools that help to augment the COMP 322 curriculum: HJlib and the Habanero Autograder. We presented HJlibâ€™s lightweight, library-based tasking APIs as well as quantitative data on how Autograder usage has increased through its first semester of usage and how students are gaining value from it. The experiences gained and tools developed as part of COMP 322 are generally useful, and could make an impact in parallel computing curricula at other universities globally.
