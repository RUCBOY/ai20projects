Cyberâ€“Physical Systems are a particular application of pervasive sensing technologies, where feedback control loops are deployed as end-user application. However, as a popular word, CPS are understood in different ways in different technological domains. Thus, understanding the characteristics and impact of CPS is a very complicated task.
In this work we have reviewed the elements which may be part of CPS, and, after describing the origin of CPS and its relation with Internet-of-Things, we have introduced the four main approaches for CPS existing today: control theory, computer sciences, communication engineering and vertical systems. For each domain we have explained the reference architectures with more impact, described the characteristics of CPS and review the state-of-the-art in the main research lines. Besides, we have reviewed the recent attempts to standardize the CPS. Finally, we also have discussed the main future unsolved challenges.
Originally defined in the computer sciences domain, the term CPS rapidly evolved towards other areas, increasing the dispersion in the architectures, characteristics, use-cases and, even, future challenges described for CPS. This phenomenon has been enhanced by the appearance of other terms (such as Industry 4.0, Internet-of-Things or Wireless Sensor Networks) not clearly separated from CPS, and used sometimes as synonyms. The interest of the standards organizations in normalizing the CPS will help in the future to reduce the ambiguity which surrounds that term. In particular, the efforts of the NIST in fixing a common architecture, vocabulary and reference architecture are helping companies and researchers to clearly shaping CPS technologies.
In conclusion, nowadays many equally important proposals for CPS are found. However, in the next future, the use of CPS paradigm in practical technologies and the creation of new standards related to CPS will help to narrow the scope and boundaries of these systems.
