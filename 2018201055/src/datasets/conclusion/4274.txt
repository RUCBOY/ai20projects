The study of model aqueous propylamine mixtures reveals specificities of water segregation that we have observed in several different contexts. In the range 0 < x < 0.3 we find that water forms bulky domains, similar to that we have observed in aqueous alcohols [23], [24], which lead to a prominent domain pre-peak in the oxygen-oxygen structure factor. In contrast, in the range 0.3 < x < 1, water forms linear clusters, similar to what we found in water-DMSO mixtures [25], and leading to modest structure factor pre-peaks and near ideal KBI. Hence, the aqueous propylamine behaves in a composite manner, between aqueous alcohols at low solute content and aqueous DMSO at high solute content. In fact, despite high structure factor pre-peak at small solute content, this system has quite moderate KBI, which indicates that it is nearly ideal, and consequently acts as a well mixed and homogeneous system in terms of supra-molecular entities. This is an interesting system, which seems nearly ideal, despite very strong Hbonding interactions, but which tend to self-segregate each species into weakly interacting macro-molecular entities, and probably more the water than the amine molecules.
The discussion above opens several questions about the kinetics of the water aggregation under mixing conditions. What is the exchange time constant of monomeric water molecules between the clusters entities? How does this kinetic influences the dynamical properties rather than the static properties. We do not provide answers to these questions in this work. Beyond these questions, the interpretation proposed here deserves a deeper investigation, perhaps to eventually lead to a better understanding of the well documented, but still not deeply understood phenomena such as the hydrophobic effect, and the role of water in the biophysical context.
