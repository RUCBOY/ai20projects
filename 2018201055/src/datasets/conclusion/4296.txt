Molecular Dynamics simulation based on UNIVERSAL force field has been used to investigate the mechanism of proton transport in Nafion fuel-cell membrane. The calculated diffusion constant and conductivity of proton agreed well to the experimental value. The analysis of pair correlation functions shows that the water molecules surrounded protons and spaced out the sulfonic acid groups and protons. From the trajectories of protons, we showed that protons moving in cluster-network of Nafion membrane. In addition, we found that the proton transport between water molecules belongs to proposed vehicular and Grotthuss mechanisms. The analysis of intermolecular distances between proton and its neighboring waters demonstrated existing of poly-hydronium complex structure.
