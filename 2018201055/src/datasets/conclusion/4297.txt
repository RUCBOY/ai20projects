We have proposed an image processing algorithm that is particularly useful for applications requiring real-time processing. It transforms the RGB colorspace into three different colorspaces, each of which is processed simultaneously enabling high throughput. To facilitate parallel processing, we have also proposed an efficient ANoC that achieves an operational frequency of 644 MHz at an area expense of 1208.9 µm2 for 90 nm technology. By means of precision-recall curves and FPGA simulation of real-data, we have demonstrated that our design outperforms a few existing approaches in literature in terms of computation time and accuracy. This work has laid the foundation to developing an autonomous system that will not just be capable of classifying the diseases on plants’ leaves, but recommending the appropriate pesticide with minimal human intervention. The logical followup to this work is to mount the FPGA containing our system on an unmanned vehicle for a real surveillance application.
