In this research, we propose a comprehensive energy-efficient resource orchestrating solution for cloud computing system. Based on the workload prediction and the convex optimization, the proposed approach can provide the appropriate migrating instructions for the cloud to stack the VMs and cut down the number of running PMs. Consequently, the power consumption is significantly reduced while still maintaining the quality of service. Besides, by evaluating on both Google traces and Montage toolkit, we show that our approach is not only effective on the synthetic data, but also save the energy on the realistic system. Furthermore, due to the fact that most of the computation focuses on creating the predictive workload information, the complexity of the corresponding component, which is O(nlogn), should be taken into account as the complexity of the proposed approach. In reality, this level of low complexity is quite feasible to be integrated as an energy savings module into any popular cloud orchestrators (such as OpenStack, OpenNebula, Nimbus, etc.). In future, we plan to extend our idea to the heterogeneous system to improve the adaptation of the proposed approach for real-life scenario.
