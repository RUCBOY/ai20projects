The described research project aims to enrich the learning contexts of pre-schools involved in the experimentation through the validation of an educational and methodological teaching proprium characterized by a plurality of requests and opportunities related to the output of the various solutions with which the children, the teachers and, possibly, the parents will be called to confront. By deepening its roots in the principles of the pedagogical activism and the “new schools”, through the most recent rediscovery of the Montessori and Munari thought, up to the current educational policies for the kindergarten, the project applies the theory of Embodied and Situated Cognition (according to which our sensory-motor interactions with the environment determine the organization of the neuro-cognitive structures) in the research of psycho-pedagogical practices that enhance the potentialities of the new technologies. This perspective is enriched with an epistemological approach that emphasizes the social dimension of learning as the result of the individual's participation in the communities of practice. In this view, the construction of knowledge is facilitated by the formation of a social identity shared with the community, through the execution of joint activities. This will allow planning, designing and implementing Smart Learning & Teaching Environments that will be integrated into the curriculum for kindergarten and primary school; creating situations of learning and teaching that will respect the principles of continuity and balanced growth; building spaces of expression and multi-sensorial experience that will encourage digital game situations mediated by multimedia languages; promoting greater participation and relationship among the different actors of the educational process (teachers, parents and students) that will increase the sense of learning community and the educational co-responsibility. The primary aim of the project is testing the potentialities of the media applied to the design of educational activities able to recover the principles of the spontaneous or guided exploration, the central role of the touch and the manipulation, the involvement of the senses during the course of discovery, by recovering the value of what Hawkins (1974) defined “doodling” and Munari (1972) “hands-on”.
The project started in January 2015 in the territories of Rome, Naples, Salerno and Trento.
