The standard (furnace) isothermal crystallization process, described by the Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov model, is characterized by an exponential s-shaped curve specifying the transformed volume fraction in time. On the contrary, a crystallization induced by a focused laser beam is non-isothermal and the heated volume is limited. This study shows that in the laser-induced process, the Raman scattering intensity of the transformed volume grows approximately linearly in the time-logarithmic scale. In summary, this study has shown that:
i)For the laser-induced crystallization process, the irradiation time has the same significance as in conventional furnace crystallization experiments.ii)Ignoring time dependence of the crystallization process may lead to misinterpretation of the measured time-averaged Raman spectra, since the spectra may combine signals from the amorphous and partially crystallized phase in an unknown proportion.iii)These experiments, together with numerical simulations, demonstrate that the kinetics of the laser-induced crystallization process is primarily controlled by random nucleation and crystal growth, whose temperature dependence is given by the Arrhenius law.iv)The previous point indicates that Raman-instrumented laser-induced crystallization experiments may be used to study its kinetics. And – for instance – a method to identify the activation energy of the process could be developed.
