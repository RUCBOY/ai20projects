In this work, we have introduced a novel method for extracting, assessing, and evaluating fragments of BNs from textual sources, based on grammar and lexical properties, as well as on the topological properties of the network extracted. Furthermore, the ability to assess knowledge which is not directly specified, allows the discovery of relations between concepts in the corresponding BNs. The evaluation clearly shows the accuracy and potential of the proposed approach. Our knowledge and representation of the world relies heavily on unknown parameters, which are based on a priori knowledge and inadequate certainty of the particular scenario to be modelled. Furthermore, the accuracy and availability of the underlying information is also a crucial aspect to be addressed. BNs provide a very powerful tool for a broad range of applications, with particular emphasis on cause and effect modelling in a wide variety of domains. This clearly has a number of far reaching applications, which have important implications in multiple contexts and research fields. In particular, we are aiming to embed this effort into a wider line of research, where text corpora from different sources and contexts are fully analysed, and subsequently integrated with a deeper semantic analysis to allow a full network investigation and a more comprehensive knowledge discovery process.
