By collecting a designed and curated data set of 1 million samples, we have enabled the advancement of both the technology and science of biometrics. The resulting understanding provides a solid basis for decisions on when and how to field biometric systems. The resulting datasets continue to be heavily used in research on still, video and 3D face recognition, and iris recognition.
