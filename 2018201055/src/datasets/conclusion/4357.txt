We argue that images offer a unique and underused lens through which to understand human engagement with the environment. Digital image datasets such as those on social media, and housed in newspapers and other archives, could help SIA practitioners and others identify issues, predict responses, inform future proposals or reflect on the impacts of past ones. Thanks to progress in computer science and other fields, culturomic tools are on the horizon to leverage digital image datasets. Such tools hold considerable promise as nonreactive research methods to expand the SIA toolkit. Social scientists, archivists, as well as members and scholars of disadvantaged communities or cultural groups must become centrally involved to ensure that such tools are carefully developed and tested, and appropriately and justly applied. Such tools must never replace direct engagement with stakeholders.
