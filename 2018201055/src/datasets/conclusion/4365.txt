In this study, the selective thermal transformation of older generation PCBs has resulted in the production of Cu-Sn nanoparticles at 900 °C and the separation out of toxic Pb at the Pb-rich phase. The mechanism of this thermal transformation has been investigated using SEM and TEM.
During heat treatment at 900 °C, first the Sn-Pb alloy began to melt and due to high wettability of this alloy on Cu, it covered the Cu particles. At this temperature, the diffusion of Sn into Cu was triggered resulting in the formation of the Cu-Sn alloy and the separation out of the Pb due to low solubility of Pb in Cu, less than 0.04%, and the high solubility of Sn in Cu, more than 8%, at this temperature.
The degradation of the organic components of the PCBs samples generated a reducing environment which acted as a ‘thermal micronizing’ media which micronized the liquid Cu-Sn alloy as well as protecting the nanoparticles from oxidation. The residual carbon limited the direct contact between the metallic nanoparticles and agglomeration.
This study has established a novel pathway for a controlled transformation of metals in e-waste and the direct production of Cu-Sn nanoparticles, a useful bronze nanoparticles through an innovative “thermal micronizing” process.
