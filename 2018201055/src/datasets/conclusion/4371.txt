The configurations shown in Fig. 6, illustrate the most typical ways of forming the HBs with methanol by p-HBA, MP and PP molecules. Each of the compounds is characterized by a high selective solvation by cosolvent molecules due to the formation of stable HBs.Download : Download full-size imageFig. 6. The most typical hydrogen bonded configurations solute â€“ cosolvent.
Parabens, unlike p-HBA can be not only donors but also proton acceptors in respect of cosolvent. Therefore, when using a protic cosolvent, the number of its molecules involved in parabens solvation will be greater than, for example, it is in the case of acetone. And since selective solvation by cosolvent molecules causes an increase in the solubility of polar organic compounds in the SC CO2, the protic cosolvents, such as low molecular weight alcohols should increase the solubility of the parabens in a greater degree than acetone.
The ability of PP to form HBs as a proton acceptor is higher than that of the MP. At the same time the ability of MP and PP to be the proton donor in respect of cosolvent is almost identical. Thus, it can be assumed that the additional effect of the use of a protic cosolvent will be higher for parabens with a long alkyl group.
