The data science technique was able to find new datasets of features, and these enhance the underlying machine learning (model building) process. The data science technique presented here delivers structures to the scientist which can then be transformed into knowledge. On the other hand, this technique is very computing-intensive and can be only meaningfully used with powerful cluster computers.
