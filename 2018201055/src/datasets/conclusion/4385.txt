This paper presents a synthesis of domain requirements, technical challenges, and available automatic data collection and information modeling techniques in order to reveal the potential and needs of an HCA system in achieving resilient nuclear power plant (NPP) outage control. After reviewing the practical problems of NPP outage control, the authors identified two practical problems critical in resilient NPP outage control: handoff process control and proactively responding to contingencies. To address these practical problems, this paper proposes HCA for resilient outage control for resilient NPP outage control. The major findings include:
•An HCA system should be able to automatically collect human factor information and make decisions considering the interactions between human, workspace, and tasks through human-in-the-loop modeling and simulation.•In the nuclear and construction industries, previously efforts have been made focusing on the automation techniques related to tasks and workspaces. Therefore, considering human factors including SA, physical and mental workload, communication, and anthropometric and physiological factors is the current focus of developing the proposed HCA system for NPP outage control.•A research roadmap developed by the authors indicates that the challenges related to information acquisition and modeling lie between current outage control approaches and the proposed HCA approach. Existing techniques could potentially address these challenges, and a research roadmap can guide the future researches in identifying HCA technologies and motivating relevant technology explorations.•The roadmap reveals the needs for future investigations into “Multimedia data analytics for handoff monitoring and diagnosis” through utilizing the state-of-the-art sensing and modeling techniques.•The proposed research roadmap highlights “real-time cognitive task analysis based on communication analysis” as another promising area, which needs the development of natural language processing technology with higher performance and new theories describing the complex team skills.•“Human-in-the-Loop Cyber-physical system” is a critical research question about achieving the proposed HCA for resilient NPP outage control, calling for the advance of cognitive science, computer science, system science and a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic scenario in NPP outages.
Overall, the HCA system and various techniques synthesized in this paper should also be potentially beneficial for automated control of other shutdown projects, such as the turnaround of petrochemical plants, shutdown maintenance of other types of power plants and water supply system, and fast bridge maintained and construction on highways. In order to achieve HCA in the control of other shutdown projects, researchers need to 1) define handoffs and describe the handoff scenarios considering the interaction of “human, task, and workspace”; 2) identify key features of potential contingencies (e.g. types, frequencies, potential harms, and pre-defined responses); and 3) profiling human activities within workflows in those projects.
