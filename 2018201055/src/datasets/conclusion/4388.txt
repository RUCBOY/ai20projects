Because of the topological space is stripped of the geometric form and it is used to measure things that are difficult to measure, such as intelligence, beauty and goodness. So, we used the concept of grill to expand this space to help us measure the things that are difficult to measure. In this paper, properties of Gâˆ’Ng-closed sets between Nano topological spaces in terms of grill are obtained and the expansion of Nano generalized closed sets by grill is introduced.
