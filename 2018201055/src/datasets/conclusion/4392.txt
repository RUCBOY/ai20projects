In this study, a computational model which includes AH flow, heat transfer, as well as diffusive and convective transport of the drug concentration is developed to investigate the drug transport process after subconjunctival and episcleral implantation in the anterior human eye. We focus on drug delivery to three targets, the iris, lens and TM, and our results show that drug transport in the anterior eye is strongly affected by the AH flow in the anterior chamber. Subconjunctival implantation, compared with episcleral implantation, is more effective due to the shorter delivery path to its targets. Compared with the up-facing eye, drug concentration in the anterior chamber is more uniform and drug delivery is more effective in the horizontally-facing eye. Implantation at 12 o'clock circumferential position is the most effective for drug delivery to iris and lens, and implantation at 3 o'clock circumferential position is the most effective for drug delivery to TM. Our computational model, as well as the numerical results, can help to better understand the delivery process of implanted drugs in the anterior human eye, and improve delivery efficacy for clinical treatment of anterior eye diseases.
