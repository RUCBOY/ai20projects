A simulation model based on Finite Element Methods (FEM) for magnetoelectric (ME) composites was developed. 3-D and 2D-axisymmetrical models were used to obtain the ME performance CFO/PVDF spheres according to their size (diameter) and weight concentration (wt. %). Both models show a good agreement in the ME curve over the applied magnetic field, between 200 and 2000 Oe, leading to larger ME effect when sphere size is larger or when higher wt.% of the magnetostrictive CFO is present in the sphere.
Simulation show stable results in all studied structures. It is shown that high concentration of CFO and thin PVDF thickness improve the ME response. Besides, for lower CFO concentrations and thicker piezoelectric layers, PVDF's elasticity diminished the ME response, not being able to suitably transform the magnetostrictive deformation into electric potential.
It was found that the ME response was optimized at 1000 Oe to 947 V/cm when the content of CFO is increased from 20 wt% to 90 wt% and the sphere diameter is increased from 0.1 to 1.4 μm.
The obtained theoretical results reveal that is possible to experimentally optimize the already reported CFO/PVDF sphere response [11], by increasing magnetostrictive phase content, opening in this way, new applications fields of low-dimension ME materials such as in magnetic nano-sensors and actuators, non-invasive control of cell growth and differentiation, active drug release and tissue stimulation.
