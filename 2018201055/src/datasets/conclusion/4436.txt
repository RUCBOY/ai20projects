In this paper, a new methodology for the efficient numerical estimation of complex multi-dimensional boundaries has been proposed. This problem is typical of engineering design criteria defining the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable design parameter values. The proposed procedure is particularly valuable when the number of parameters and/or the complexity of the criterion requires computationally expensive numerical simulations. A support vector machine (SVM) is used to identify the boundary hyper-surface from a set of simulation results. The combination of a low-discrepancy sequence (Sobol) of parameter values and an SVM-based active learning approach for the selection of subsequent simulations is the key factor that allows the efficient refinement of the boundary estimation. The selection of informative samples from the Sobol set enables a balancing of exploration and exploitation without complex ad hoc diversification mechanisms present in previous studies while achieving similar (if not superior) boundary accuracy.
The methodology has been applied to two highly-nonlinear known functions to demonstrate the accuracy of the resulting boundary estimation and a priori resolution target. Subsequently, the algorithm has been utilised in a real-world engineering design application: the acceptability of train suspension parameters in terms of running stability.
