This paper proposes a new attributed covariate-relation graph (ACRG) to represent an image set. In terms of classification, a new graph sparse representation and classification (GSRC) method has been proposed to achieve ACRG classification. The experimental results show that our ACRG method achieves better performance and more robustly than other compared methods including our previous work CRG. Also, GSRC performs better than traditional KLDA for classification.
