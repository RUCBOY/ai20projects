Thus, the relative errors by all algorithms were 3–14% at lower temperature regions. However, at high temperature regions, ART and SART algorithm showed the maximum error of 350 K at 950 K, and 330 K at 1280 K, respectively. However, MART algorithm showed the maximum errors within 1 K at high temperature regions. This implies that MART algorithm is recommendable rather than ART and SART algorithms for CT-TDLAS calculations.(3)The calculation time for convergence to the minimum error by SMART algorithm was the shortest among four algorithms, while the convergence time to the minimum error by SART algorithm showed shorter than by those by ART and MART algorithms. Further, the magnitude of the MSE (mean squared errors) by SMART algorithm was the smallest, and the iterative number was only within 50 for reaching to the convergences.(4)It has been proven numerically that SMART algorithm was the most reliable approach for reconstructing the multiple signals of CT-TDLAS. The relative error ratio in the results obtained by SMART algorithm was about 1.4%.
