In this paper we presented a smart sensor approach for a locating system. By relocating signal processing from a computation cluster to distributed antennas, signal processing will be performed in an embedded receiver. This saves computational components and therefore costs for the backend (e.g. cluster computer), simplify the communication network and reduce the systemâ€™s overall infrastructural footprint.
To find a fast processing system, we analyzed algorithms and discussed the execution on different embedded hardware processors. We also considered combinations of different architectures for a heterogeneous system, to further improve performance. Depending on different system parameters (power, implementation effort) we are able to make recommendations regarding the usage of specific architectures and also found reference for possible benefits of heterogeneous processing.
Although our evaluation grants insights in the application of embedded CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and Many-Core CPUs for smart antennas, architecture specific optimizations still remain a challenge. Accordingly, most parts of the code used for benchmarking could not be re-used for the other evaluated platforms, but had to be ported due to platform specific optimizations. For the application of diverse embedded multi-core platforms, the effort of adaption and optimization for multiple platforms might be a significant obstacle. As a result embedded platforms could suffer from inefficiency, since more accessible architectures provide higher development- or product-costs.
Therefore, our future work will not only be focused on the application of heterogeneous multi-core platforms, but also on pragmatic aspects like programmability and comprehensive development strategies.
