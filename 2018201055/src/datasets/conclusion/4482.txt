A practical approach to selectively delete data objects in a forensically sound manner was presented. In addition to existing wiping tools, this tool is able to fulfill legal requirements in regard to non-relevant data for an investigative case the way it was requested by Castiglione etÂ al. (2011) and other mentioned privacy laws. Not only the data content itself is securely erased, but also all metadata, which may contain information about the user or the files, is irrecoverably deleted. The gap between the legal request for a selective deletion method and official statements, that no forensically sound tools might exist, can be closed with the proposed approach. The provenance of authenticity and integrity of the original device respectively the remaining files in the image, is kept. By continuous logging of every single step in the deletion process, a perfect proven documentation is guaranteed. While the presented implementation focuses on NTFS-structured devices or their corresponding images, support for other file-systems like (ex)FAT, Ext or HFS is imaginable and technically realizable in the future. To face critical appraisals of selective deletion it is clearly stated that the approach presented here provides a forensically sound deletion process for data objects. The correct handling depends on the user, which means: even if a selective deletion method exists, there is no guarantee to catch all non-relevant data because the selection is still made by a human.
