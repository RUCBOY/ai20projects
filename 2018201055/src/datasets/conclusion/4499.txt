This study found support for the use of short computer-based simulation exercises as a method to train head nurses to improve management skills and increase their self-efficacy. Simulation-based training is known to increase skill and self-efficacy in a range of domains, and this work provides additional support for the use of short and small-scale simulation-based training as a mean to create opportunities for clinical staff to engage in such training with little impact on day-to-day activities.
