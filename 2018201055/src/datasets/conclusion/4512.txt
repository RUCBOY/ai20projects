First, this article introduces the cognitive reasoning process and micro-expression recognition. Then, based on the Gaussian cloud model, we describe the realization of emotional recognition process of the Gross model. What's more, the attenuation function and threshold function are proposed for quantizing the process. Further, the Gaussian cloud algorithm is introduced into the model to calculate the transferring probabilities. Finally, we discuss the value of wi.
The experimental results show that the model in human–computer interaction can effectively regulate the emotional states, and can significantly improve the humanoid and intelligent ability of the robot. This model is consistent with experimental and emulational significance of the psychology, and allows the robot to get rid of the mechanical emotional transfer process.
Typical functions of the conclusion of a scientific paper include 1) summing up, 2) a statement of conclusions, 3) a statement of recommendations, and 4) a graceful termination. Any one of these, or any combination, may be appropriate for a particular paper. Some papers do not need a separate concluding section, particularly if the conclusions have already been stated in the introduction.
