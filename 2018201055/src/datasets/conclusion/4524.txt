Proposed in this work adaptive rerouting algorithm based on the paired shifts data can increase the efficiency of adaptive routing processes in networks distributed DC that are served by different communication providers during dynamic failures on the communication nodes or links through the lack of need to perform a full recalculation of the routing tables and reduce the complexity of constructing routing tables O(mN).
