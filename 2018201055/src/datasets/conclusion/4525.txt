This study increases our understanding of the reasons for unequal gender access to ICTs and the importance of equal access for both genders. Gender issues are at the heart of ICTs and essential to the success of sustainable development. This is definitely true in the case of Rwandan women, as it has been shown in this research, who have a great role to play in the development process. However, this role continues to be hampered by social, infrastructure and cultural factors. Therefore, women need to be more educated about the use of computer technologies and thus change their relationship to technology.
Finally, this research has revealed that equal access to ICTs among women can contribute to gender equality. However, there are several challenges that prevent this equal access and effective use. Such challenges are related to the presence of pornography on the Internet which make women (especially rural dwellers) fearful to access ICT infrastructures. Certain gender-sensitive strategies that guide the use of ICTs in this way also need to be established. These strategies would guarantee equal access and social equality while defending the rights of people, particularly women, who are more disadvantaged than men. It is also imperative to include women in the discussions related to these trends.
This study shows some causes of the gender digital divide and the high potential for ICTs, particularly computers and the Internet in information dissemination. However, to better understand how full gender equality in using and accessing ICTs can be achieved, further research is needed to explore the implications as well as the intended and unintended outcomes of other ICTs such as mobile phones. Future research should also analyze the effect of age and martial status on the gender digital divide.
