Remarkable advances in smart technologies have paved the way toward a new computing paradigm called the IoT. This study discussed the ransomware attacks and security concerns in IoT. First, we discussed the rise of ransomware attacks and outlined the associated challenges. Second, we investigated, reported, and highlighted the state-of-the-art research efforts on IoT security. Third, a taxonomy is devised by classifying and categorizing the literature. Fourth, a few credible case studies are presented to alert people on the vulnerability of IoT devices to threats. Fifth, we enumerated the requirements for securing IoT. Sixth, several indispensable research challenges are identified and discussed. Seventh, several prominent research directions are provided. Finally, we conclude that although IoT can facilitate different aspects of people's lives, most IoT devices are vulnerable to ransomware attacks. Therefore, strengthening of the IoT security and mitigation of ransomware attacks should be given great importance to build user trust in the IoT.
