In this paper, we revisit the Max-PoSSo problem and the ISBS method. For the basic of Max-PoSSo, we show some results about the behavior of the success rate of recovering the true solution. For ISBS, we present some theoretical results about the number of branches in the search tree, and propose some ways to decrease the number of branches for general polynomial systems and overdetermined polynomial systems. We implement a new algorithm based on these improvements and test it by solving the Cold Boot Key recovery problem of Serpent with symmetric noise. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the ISBS algorithm implemented in [11], the new algorithm is about 2â€“4 times faster for different benchmarks.
There is an idea of further improving ISBS which can be applied in the future. In the improved algorithm, when the artificial noise-bound increases gradually, there are some repeated computations which can be avoided. We know that Tquasi doesn't change after the noise-bound increased. It means that after we increase the artificial noise-bound we only need to continue searching the paths in Tquasi which are pruned because of the former noise-bound. Therefore, if we can store the information of all these paths efficiently, a lot of repeated computations can be avoided.
