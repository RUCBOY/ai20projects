In light of the Self-Determination Theory of motivation, we developed a program for an Introductory Cell Biology course that better meets the needs of autonomy, relatedness and perceived competence. As a result we have introduced structured lectures, a blend of passive and active learning methods, and have replaced the practical class with a team-based project where students create a science-writing blog on a subject of their choice but which is still related to cell biology. We have learned from both qualitative and quantitative surveys that students highly appreciate the blog task. They appreciate the freedom of choosing a subject and constructing a blog in their own fashion, i.e. working in autonomy. They express a sense of usefulness (perceived competence) because their efforts are embedded in a broad social context, the web. They express their appreciation in terms of the pleasure of sharing understanding and constructing a blog together (sense of relatedness). Moreover, the quantitative Intrinsic Motivation Inventory revealed that students worked in an intrinsically motivated fashion, i.e. they were fully “self-determined”. As a consequence, staff-student contact time, both in lectures and in tutorials, has gained in quality. Besides the aforementioned broad social embedding, the success of the blog project also lies in the specific affordances of this social medium. We postulate that both the public exposure and the complexity of the task provide an immense purpose for team effort. The ensuing quality of team functioning creates a feeling of collective competence and this becomes an argument for motivation in its own right. If one considers higher education as “lighting the fire” rather than “filling the bucket” (Kusurkar & Ten Cate, 2013), then group-based science-writing in the blogosphere is an excellent learning tool.
