Difficulties in quantifying and monitoring small-scale pollution events have resulted in a lack of information with little known about their magnitude and impact. Traditional scientific methods to collect data are not feasible on the scale required for monitoring. Citizen science can be used to document small-scale events; however, the study design and methods need to be carefully considered to ensure that data are reliable and robust. Reviews of existing citizen science projects showed that collation and analysis of data from existing citizen science projects was not possible as there is no consistent source at a UK level. However, existing projects have demonstrated the potential for citizen science to deliver data on small-scale pollution events and may increase levels of understanding and engagement with science.
To deliver evidence and better understanding of small-scale spills at a UK level, a two-stage citizen science approach could be implemented: 1. a mass participation project with regional coverage, providing small amounts of data at a large temporal scale; and 2. a small-scale local coverage monitoring with a focus on obtaining coverage at a fine temporal and regional scale. Rather than develop a bespoke project, a better and lower cost solution is proposed that involves partnering with existing UK marine citizen science programmes to develop small-scale pollution event reporting within existing projects. A system is also needed that integrates citizen and traditional science with outputs that feed into response networks and enforcement officials.
