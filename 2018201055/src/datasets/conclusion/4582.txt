Several studies have investigated different architectures for modulo-(2n + 1) addition, where those with D1 encoding have reported the highest performance. In particular the (3 + 2⌈log n⌉)ΔG modulo-(2n + 1) TPP D1 adder of [4] leads to balanced latency adders for all the three modulus of the popular C={2n±1,2n} set. This has been achieved via reformulation of the equation for sum bits, such that one of the two carry-independent sum values is selected by the actual carry signal. We use the same trick to achieve (3 + 2⌈log n⌉)ΔG modulo-(2n + 1) TPP D1 subtractor, where the equally fast adder and subtractor justifies the design of our (5 + 2⌈log n⌉)ΔG modulo-(2n + 1) unified D1 adder/subtractor, all with full zero handling.
The latter achievements promote the latency balance among the computation channels in C , for subtraction, unified add/sub, as well as for addition. Analytically evaluated delay improvements are confirmed by synthesis reports that indicate 18- 34% decrease in delay. Moreover, 5–18% reduction in energy and 12–28% in area-time measures for the ensemble three moduli of C are experienced, at the cost of moderately extra area consumption and additional power dissipation.
Design of efficient binary to D1 and the reverse conversion circuits are planned for future research. Balanced latency multiplication for the moduli set C is also a topic of interest.
