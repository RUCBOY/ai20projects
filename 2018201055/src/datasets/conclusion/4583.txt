Graphical passwords are developed as an interesting alternative to traditional text-based passwords. In real-world applications, we find that the process of creating graphical passwords can be different between a computer and a touchscreen smartphone. For instance, users can perform actions like multi-touch on smartphones than on desktop computers (De Luca etÂ al., 2012). Multi-touch has become a distinguishing feature for touch-enabled mobile phones.
In this work, we studied the potential for multi-touch to generate click-draw based graphical passwords (CD-GPS) on mobile devices. In particular, we investigate the influence of multi-touch on password space, users' performance and touch preference during CD-GPS creation, which can be classified into six aspects: 1) theoretical password space, 2) success rate and completion time, 3) the number of clicks, 4) the percentage of multi-touch usage, 5) multi-touch patterns and 6) image preference. In the user study, we developed a prototype of multi-touch enabled CD-GPS on smartphones. The study with a total of 90 participants demonstrates that using multi-touch has had a positive influence on users' performance such as increasing success rate and decreasing completion time. Moreover, our study indicates that users can feel more comfortable in drawing their secrets (i.e., using more multi-touch clicks and selecting more squares), if multi-touch is enabled.
