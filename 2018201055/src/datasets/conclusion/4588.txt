The current study shows that the proposed video-based analysis method is a viable tool for noninvasive assessment of lower back loads during occupational lifting. The accuracy of the method is comparable with motion tracking system for L5/S1 joint moment calculation and is a solution to the drawbacks associated with that method. This simple and relatively cheap method can be used for on-site ergonomic practice in order to decrease the risk of lower back pain in the workplaces.
