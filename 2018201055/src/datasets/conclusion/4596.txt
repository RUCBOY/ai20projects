SimBasin has proved to be a valuable catalyst for bringing stakeholders together in the context of the Magdalena-Cauca. It provided a space free from the restrictions of past systems where stakeholders and scientists can meet and critically compare mental and computer models, with interesting insights gained on both sides. It proved a successful way of involving the media and connecting with a wider range of participants than other types of workshops.
The experience gained is also useful for those considering using serious gaming in other contexts. Firstly, the game can simulate decision-making processes as they are, or it can simulate what could be, demonstrating the value of integrated decision-making. Secondly, by bridging the gap between science and policy, professionals mental models and scientists models can mutually enrich each other. Lastly, since serious gaming is popular and seemingly becoming more so, it can be effective in helping to attract attention and create a sense of urgency. However, a plan should be in place for what to do with this momentum once it has been created. For example, SimBasin was created as part of a strategy to link TNCs decision support tools to decision-makers. The decision to use serious gaming should be made based on a consideration of the problem, particularly the synergies that could be created, for example with media organizations.
In conclusion, SimBasin demonstrates that the appeal of serious gaming can be successfully harnessed to both get scientists and stakeholders around the same table, and put something on the table for them to talk about.
