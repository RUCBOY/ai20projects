Link prediction is a well-studied and challenging data mining task associated with network theory and social network analysis. Since most of the real world networks are complex-structured and very large, we need efficient and scalable methods for mining and analysis. We have developed a scalable method which can perform link prediction on networks of larger scale. We propose a new similarity measure based on Adamicâ€“Adar score, the community information generated from the topological structure of the network and the degree centrality of within-community common neighbors. A parallel label propagation algorithm for community detection and a parallel similarity measure algorithm for link prediction are also proposed in this work. We have developed these algorithms by using the Bulk Synchronous Parallel programming model and implemented them by means of two open source implementations of BSP model for graph processing, namely Apache Giraph and Apache Graphx. Experiments with datasets of various domains show that our method is well suited for link prediction in large-scale graphs like social networks.
However, the proposed link prediction algorithm in BSP involves lot of message generation and transfer which can affect the system performance. Strategies to improve the performance can be a direction for further study. Scalable link prediction on time varying networks can be another challenging area for research. Parallel algorithm design and implementation for scalable social network analysis and large-scale machine learning can also be considered for work in the future.
