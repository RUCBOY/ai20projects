ELM is known for its extremely fast learning speed and good generalization performance, which makes it quite suitable for online learning. Herein, we designed a semi-supervised P300 speller system using ST-RWOS-ELM, which has the advantages of short calibration time and low computational complexity. From the experimental results, the system can provide comparable accuracy to SUST-LSSVM, but with much lower computation complexity. By using this system, the accuracy can be quickly enhanced to around 90%. Such low training effort makes the system more suitable for practical use.
