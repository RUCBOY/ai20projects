In this paper, we presented a BCI framework BHCR based on a BBCI method for target image retrieval in RSVP sequences. By fully taking advantage of CV and HV insights, the BHCR framework achieved better retrieval performance compared to the EEG-only mechanism. We also compared the BHCR framework to previous works in several ways to reveal its advantages. To construct a well-suited EEG decoding module for BHCR, we then conducted a comparison of classification algorithms, which indicated that RF outperformed other candidate classification algorithms in the EEG decoding task. More deeply investigating the image database retrieval task, we provided a probability propagation scheme and a one-shot image database retrieval scheme. Although there are still many interesting work directions around the BHCR framework, and some aspects of the BHCR framework could be improved in the future, this study suggests that the proposed framework could be useful for assisting individuals in handling target image retrieval tasks in RSVP sequences.
