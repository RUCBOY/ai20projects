In this work we have proposed a new approach for community detection in complex networks. The approach is based on evolutionary algorithm to find the community structure and the merging of communities. The approach is constructed for undirected and unweighted networks. Results obtained on computer-generated networks and real benchmark social network argue for the capacity of the approach to detect real communities. Future developments are required like testing the algorithm on large scale networks, detect overlapping communities.
