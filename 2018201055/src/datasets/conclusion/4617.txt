In this paper, three methods were presented for the synthesis of continuous-wave or pulsed time-evolving fields with partial spatial and temporal coherence. The complex screen and phase screen approaches involve filtering in the frequency domain, allowing use of the numerically efficient FFT algorithm. The complex screen method permits a wide range of coherence functions, even coherence functions which are not separable in space and time, but its memory requirements are demanding. The phase screen method generates fields which are random in phase only, which is helpful for some applications, such as field generation using an SLM. However, producing partially-coherent fields with non-exponential (i.e., not Gaussian or Lorentzian) DoCs can be difficult. The third method is a different implementation of the first two. It combines spectral filtering in space with convolution in time, greatly reducing the memory requirements at the expense of computation time. This implementation greatly eases synthesis of large sources by avoiding the need for distributed-memory supercomputers.
Simulations and experiments were performed to test the validity of all three synthesis methods. Using a modified Young's interference experiment, all methods showed excellent agreement with theory in both the numerical and laboratory experiments. These results demonstrated the accuracy of the three simulation methods.
The work presented here will be useful in applications where the time evolution of a partially-coherent source is important. These applications include scenarios involving high-speed electronics/detectors, propagation of optical vortices through turbulence, et cetera. In addition to its practical uses, this work can also be used as an educational tool, in which watching the source temporally evolve can provide more insight than theory alone.
