In this paper, we have shown that in certain fair equilibria of some natural games, the player with a quantum computer can be more powerful than the classical opponent, even if the initially shared state has zero entanglement or zero discord. This indicates that at least in games, the notion that nonzero discord is necessary to produce a quantum advantage needs to be adjusted. Our work calls for further studies on quantum information processing when different parties are involved with different objectives.
Many questions are left for future research, and we list some here: (1) What is the maximum gain in a zero-sum [−1,1]-normalized game3 with a state in the symmetric subspace without entanglement? (2) What is the maximum gain in a zero-sum [−1,1]-normalized game with a state in the symmetric subspace without discord? (3) While this paper studies symmetric states for fairness to the classical player, the general case of non-symmetric states is also very interesting. What can we say about that?
