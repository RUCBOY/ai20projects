In this paper, we proposed a watermarking algorithm for 3D scene using MCA transform and GA. Performance improvement with respect to existing algorithms benefited by the GA optimization. In our optimization process, we use GA searching to the optimized transform domain for watermarking embedding. It is imperceptibility because we make use of GA to search for transform domain. In addition to the imperceptibility of the proposed algorithm, we also improve the robustness of watermark with the aid of holography. The experimental results demonstrate the presented method achieves good imperceptibility and robustness against attacks. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed by comparing it with the previous scheme.
