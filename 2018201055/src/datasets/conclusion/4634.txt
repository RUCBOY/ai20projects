We present an illumination and pose variable face recognition method based on illumination normalization combined with WULBP_MHOG features and WSRC. The main contribution of our work is that WULBP_MHOG features put forward, where MHOG features are the variant of HOG features and have lower dimension. Furthermore, adaptive weights are introduced to extract more effective detail information. Another contribution is given by combining with WSRC, which integrates locality and sparse information in classification. Besides, experiments have been conducted on different image blocks, classifiers, features and the state-of-the-art methods under different numbers of training samples per class or different subsets. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method improves the recognition performance significantly.
In the future work, we will extend our work as the following: (1) other more effective illumination preprocessing methods; (2) pose correction methods or frontal face synthesis; (3) more robust illumination and pose invariant feature extraction; (4) more discriminated and faster classifiers; (5) hybrid methods. And we will extend it to solve face recognition with larger angles of illumination, pose yawing and pitching.
