We have shown that T(11)=T(12)=8 and T(13)=T(14)=T(15)=T(16)=9, i.e., we have proven that the previously known upper bounds on the optimal depth of n-channel sorting networks are tight for 11≤n≤16. This closes the six smallest open instances of the optimal-depth sorting network problem, thereby proving depth optimality of the sorting networks for n≤16 given in [19] more than four decades ago.
These results have revived sorting networks as an active area of research. Ehlers and Müller [15] have already improved on the SAT encoding, and combined with new theoretical results [13] been able to discover a depth 10 sorting networks on 17 channels and prove its optimality [8]. These successes have also encouraged recent progress on the related optimal-size problem [10], which however required a quite different approach. The practical importance of studying optimal sorting networks was demonstrated by using them as base cases to improve the performance of general purpose sorting algorithms [17], [11].
The encoding into SAT that we propose in this paper is of size exponential in the number of channels, n. This is also the case for the encoding presented in [27]. The encoding is of the form ∃∀φ (does there exist a network that sorts all of its inputs), and is easily shown to be in Σ2P. We expect that, similar to the problem of circuit minimization [31], it is also complete in Σ2P, although we have not succeeded to prove this. We do not expect that there exists a polynomial size encoding to SAT.
