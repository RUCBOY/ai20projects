In conclusion, we have demonstrated, for the first time in electron optics, the nearly-arbitrary spatial manipulation of the electron wave function in 3D, using computer generated holograms. Our holograms are based on amplitude masks, the fabrication of which fully follows a standard electron beam lithography process. The mask consists of a well-ordered array of gold islands, the advantage of which is conductivity and high-Z scattering. The ability to manipulate electron beams in 3D heralds important possibilities for research in electron microscopy: using a liquid cell holder, one could envision spatially and temporally trapping particles for careful scrutiny, inducing and controlling the rotation of a single particle, and the interesting concept of material synthesis by trapping single atoms in a shaped, 3D electron matrix, the structure and scale of which could be dynamically controlled. Depending on the optical setup of the microscope used, these manipulations could be performed while the beam propagates below the mask using beam tilts, beam shifts, and an additional magnifying lens between the mask and sample. A dedicated system for such manipulations could also quickly switch between various masks, or split the beam so both imaging and manipulation of the sample is easily done. The same technique we show here can be used to form electron beams with more complex shapes, enabling for example the generation of a knotted electron wave-function [34] and thus enabling to study its interaction with different materials.
