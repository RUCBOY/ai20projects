In this paper, we have presented the “System for AUtomated Code Evaluation” (SAUCE), a web based framework for the assessment of software written by students and its evaluation, in the educational context of parallel programming. SAUCE is free software licensed under AGPL-3.0 and can be downloaded at https://github.com/moschlar/SAUCE free of charge.
Interactive programming exercises based on common parallelization techniques such as C++11 Threads, OpenMP, MPI and the CUDA programming model have been introduced and discussed in terms of educational benefits and applicability to be embedded in HPC or parallel computing lectures. Further teaching related features among others automated testing, correction and grading of submissions as well as plagiarism detection have been demonstrated in order to emphasize SAUCE’s benefits in teaching environments. A demo instance of SAUCE including the discussed examples can be accessed at our website  [15].
