In this study, the authors have developed and introduced new quantum reversible ternary subtractor circuits. Initially, a new ternary reversible half subtractor circuit based on ternary shift and M-S gates was designed. Then, a ternary reversible full subtractor circuit based on their proposed ternary reversible half subtractor circuit was designed. The proposed designs in the study had a lower quantum cost, hardware complexity, delay time, the number of constant inputs and garbage outputs than the existing designs. The proposed designs in this paper can be used for building more complicated circuits in quantum computing such as arithmetic processors, computational circuits, etc.
