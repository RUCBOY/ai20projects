This is the first study demonstrating that the human mirror neuron system is truly responsive to action traces, and that this responsiveness is clearly distinguishable from mere effects of visual complexity. Moreover, by showing a positive relationship between self-described empathy and mirror neuron system responses to action traces it links back empathy to the original concept of empathy as a concept of aesthetics and art perception.
