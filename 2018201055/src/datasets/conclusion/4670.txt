We have presented a single-image dehazing algorithm based on a learning framework. Comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches, our method has lower computational complexity, more reasonable dehazing effect, and stronger scene adaptability. A novel method to generate training examples is presented, and its effectiveness in handling different scene images has been demonstrated. This work has also shown that the traditional methods have limitation in handling some challenging scenes, such as the real-world streetscape images. The future work will focus on the following two aspects: first, some exceptional cases where a hazed patch has similar features with a haze-free one, causing all existing dehazing approaches fail. Second, semantic scene understanding may lead to a more intelligent dehazing process.
