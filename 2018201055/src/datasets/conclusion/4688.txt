Gender is an important factor mediating human behaviors in general. Our research explores the role of gender in cybersecurity behaviors and beliefs. We compare the constructs of our cybersecurity behavior model between male and female employees in a cross-sectional survey study. The results show that there are statistically significant gender-wise differences in terms of computer skills, prior experience, cues-to-action, security self-efficacy and self-reported cybersecurity behavior. Since women's self-efficacy is significantly lower than men, women's self-efficacy may be a target for intervention. The practical application of our findings is to develop gender-specific cybersecurity training and interventions, targeting on the relevant constructs of the cybersecurity behavior model to improve the attitudes and behaviours of employees.
