This study deals with performance assessment for onshore wind farms. In particular, it deals with the a common phenomenon, involving multiple turbines and characterized by several concurring factors [14]: wakes. Wakes are indeed a “glocal” phenomenon: the wind farm is subject to a global agent, the wind flow, but at each turbine site severe local affects might arise, especially in complex terrains. Further, the control system of each turbine might react differently, resulting in an underworld of yawing positions, each of them characterized by peculiar performances and mechanical stress. The philosophy of this study is attempting a description of a cluster of turbines, severely affected by wakes, as a whole, rather than as a collection of individuality. First developments on the subject have been achieved in [17], [18]. The objective is employing SCADA data-mining techniques for automatically identifying patterns of the cluster. Subsequently, some methods for evaluating and discriminating the patterns are proposed and discussed. Actually distinguishing goodness of a state or of a measurement is crucial in data-driven learning techniques: data must be divided, roughly speaking, in the minimum possible number of hyperplanes. Reasonable classifications are good and bad, or good, bad, possibly bad. In particular, the underlying idea of this study is that the patterns to identify and classify should, because of the complexity of the phenomenon, be physical and intuitive as much as possible: and actually the patterns we propose are indeed the nacelle alignment patterns of the cluster to the wind. This looks particularly fit and consistent because wind direction and individual response of the yawing system to it are highlighted as crucial agents of wind turbines performances when there are considerable wakes [15], [16].
On these grounds, two operations are performed in this study:
•A SCADA post-processing method is built, which allows to automatically identify the patterns of a subcluster.•Methods are formulated and discussed for building indicators of the quality of these patterns.
This approach is tested on two years of data of a subcluster of four turbines, from an onshore wind farm sited in southern Italy. The inter-turbine distance and the layout are such that considerable wake effects arise when the wind blows from the 270° sector (very populated in the wind rose, Fig. 2). Further, a met-mast lies quite symmetrically with respect to the cluster and, when the wind blows from West, captures (with fairly good approximation) free wind. The post-processing method is based on the discretization of nacelle position on a judicious fine grain, as discussed in detail in Section 3. A 4° grain is selected: the reasons of this threshold and ex-post considerations about its goodness are addressed respectively in Sections 3 The method, 4 Results. A bit to each elementary 4° interval of each turbine is associated, turning from 0 to 1 if the corresponding nacelle measurement falls inside the interval itself. Applying other post-processing methods for outliers removal (manifest incorrect nacelle alignment) discussed in Section 3, in the present case one ends up with a 15-bit number to each turbine for each 10 min time step. Gluing the numbers for each turbine of the cluster, a unique 60-bit number is obtained for each 10 min time interval of the cluster selected in this study. Discretization inevitably leads to a finite number of patterns, which are to be somehow classified and evaluated. This is at least partially achieved through the indicators formulated in Section 3. Further, in some cases, an absurdum testing ground is included: the limit in which the cluster becomes the whole wind farm. In Section 4 it is shown that the proposed indicators lose their meaning in this limit. This supports that the proposed methods highlight some features typical of clusterization phenomenon, which are not present when the cluster indeed is not a cluster. The following are some meaningful observations collected from the proposed methods:
•The proposed formulation and identification of patterns indeed is consistent because, under a vast totality of possibilities and configurations actually occupied, some patterns are far more frequent than others. In particular, more than the 15% of the measurements falls in one of the 15 most frequent patterns of the cluster.•Patterns are indeed recurrent, and not manifesting once for a compact period of time and never more. This is quantified through a Compactness Index formulated in Eq. (1). In particular, this indicator is good for consistency check: when computed for the whole wind farm, it definitely loses sense and it demonstrates that patterns simply do not exist for a whole vast farm. The lesson is that only compact clusters, as the one selected, might be described in the language of recurring patterns.•To each cluster, two main metrics are associated: normalized mean power and efficiency (as defined in [19]). The lesson is that mean power varies much more than efficiency from one configuration to the other: cluster power is, as intuitively expected, a very responsive parameter for distinguishing patterns and evaluating them. This seems not to be the case for efficiency, or at least not as much. In [19] it is shown that efficiency, even though redefined through Eq. (2) employed also in the present paper, is able to macroscopically capture regimes of underperformances, at least for the gentle terrain case, which is exactly the same of this work. Actually also macroscopically the situation is in general more complex: efficiency does not quantify goodness of performances in an absolute sense, but rather captures the degree of homogeneity in the behavior of a wind farm or cluster of turbines. For offshore wind farms, where power losses and in-homogeneity are mainly due to wakes, efficiency becomes more and more synonymous of good quality. Onshore, this is not expected with such a regularity and in [19], it is shown that in very challenging sites, in-homogeneity due to wind flow acceleration induced by the terrain might improve performances of clusters of wind turbines. The analysis of this work show that, even though the selected test case represents somehow a halfway between the features of an onshore and offshore wind farm, when one ventures in the underworld of nacelle configurations, efficiency is not a totally responsive parameter: microscopically, efficiency must be handled with care. It is therefore reasonable to find out that most of the energetically favorable configurations also display good average efficiency, but this should not be expected as a strict rule. For example the 11° most frequent configuration displays an efficiency higher than the mean, while the power is instead considerably lower.•On the recurrent configurations, negligible correlation arises between normalized mean power and average met-mast wind speed. In particular, examples of configurations associated to high wind speeds (relative to the filtered data set) and low average performances often occur. This is a strong clue of the fact that the performance deviations observed in this work are not due to changing external conditions, but rather to changing of the response to external conditions. In other words, there is an underworld (nacelles and clusters as codified in this work) to explore further.•A Power Index is formulated in Eq. (4). It is shown to be a very responsive Index, which might be useful for discriminating quality of the patterns.
In general, the outcomes of this work are interesting for the perspective of improving wind farm operation. Wakes are a very common, yet very stressing phenomenon for a wind turbine: the management is usually set according to the criterion of preserving the turbines from fatigue loads. For example, in [24] the aim of a compromise between power output and fatigue load consumption is clearly highlighted, and a typical too conservative management is cited: the so called Pattern Derating, employed in California, which is basically shutting down very second turbine of a row when the wind blows along its inclination. A stimulating question is nowadays becoming feasible: within what extent can one deviate from this kind of policies? How much is it reasonable to force custom alignment patterns (yaw active control) [20], [21]? What are the pro’s and what are the con’s of a custom policy? This work focuses on the pro’s side: it shows that the underworld of nacelle configurations can be tackled and classified in a consistent way and that there are sensible performance deviations among the patterns. This work strongly supports, therefore, that consequently also the second question is worth addressing: what are the con’s of a custom alignment policy when there are wakes? This is the main further direction the authors plan to investigate in the future: pairing the experimental SCADA analysis approach of this work with a mechanical analysis. Usefulness of this issue for improving wind farm operation also arises from the discussion in [16], where it is argued that active wind farm management is based on the idea of reducing axial induction by active control of yaw, tip speed ratio, pitch, but mere numerical simulations cannot take into account that a reduction in axial induction can alter lateral and vertical mixing of free-stream wind and therefore the yaw alignment of the downstream turbines. The wind farm selected for this study does not have a condition monitoring system, but it has been chosen because its features (gentle terrain, considerable wake effects) make it very fit for testing the reliability of the approach and the pro’s side of the problem. On these grounds, a very stimulating test case is planned to be investigated: a wind farm in complex terrains, as for example the one addressed in [25], which has also been studied as a test case of IEA-Task 31 Wakebench project [26] aiming at developing frameworks for the evaluation of wind farm flow models operating at microscale level. This shall be done for several reasons: because this wind farm has also a condition monitoring system recording vibration signals on the kHz scale, because in this wind farm there are clusters of turbines similar to the one addressed in this work, but characterized by a mixture of wakes and complexity effects, because this wind farm features different turbine models with respect to the test case of the present study (therefore it would be a valuable testing ground to assess the influence of the wind turbine technology on the proposed analysis). Another interesting further direction is linking the approach of this study to numerical models. First developments have been reached in [25] for the complex terrain test case of [26], but in that study basically the operational data are averaged, in order to compare against the steady flow predictions of the solution to Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations, obtained with the WindSim numerical tool [27]. In order to get insight into the dynamic underworld of nacelle alignment of patterns of turbines, more complex numerical approaches are needed, as Large-Eddy Simulations [28] providing a time series of the evolution of turbulence and free wind flow, possibly combined with simulation techniques describing the power extraction of the wind turbine [29], [30].
