In this paper we have summarized the results obtained in the first part of the project. In particular, we have investigated logic synthesis and area optimization techniques for diode, FET, and four-terminal switch based nanoarrays. We have proposed new decomposition methods for the four-terminal switch based model. We have also studied defect, variation and fault tolerant techniques in the presence of high defect densities and extreme parametric variations, particularly for crossbar array nano-architectures. Finally, we have introduced capacitor-resistor models for power and delay analysis.
Integrating a new technology into a mature industry such as the semiconductor industry is a long road in which device performances and manufacturability have to be developed jointly through a blend of advanced research, technology development and industry-compliant implementation. One of the major promises of emerging nanotechnologies for on-chip applications is ultimate integration density, manufacturing and integration cost reduction, and the reduction of power consumption. However, there is a big gap in 1) extending the existing electronic design automation flow for emerging technologies in order to introduce them in the architecture and system design in a systematic-way, and 2) novel computer architecture systems based on emerging technologies to provide high performance and minimize power consumption at the same time. Therefore, future work on this project includes the introduction of hybrid EDA flow as well as emerging computer architectures by gathering well respected experts working in these broad fields. In particular, the remaining part of the project will focus on implementation of logic, arithmetic, and memory elements, in order to realize a nano-crossbar based synchronous state machine.
