Accurate subject image segmentation from image backgrounds is crucial in establishing various medical diagnoses, analyzes, and medical use of computer-aided systems. In view of the various shortcomings of existing image segmentation techniques, the author of this study developed a novel algorithm for segmenting medical images called the progressive support-pixel correlation statistical method (PSCSM) to segment medical image subjects more accurately. The PSCSM algorithm first collects statistics on support-pixels to avoid statistical error caused by large patches of background and noise pixels. Second, the PSCSM algorithm uses a progressive approach to gradually classify pixels with uncertain classifications according to their relevance in order to improve the dichotomy used in most image segmentation techniques and thereby enhance segmentation accuracy for image subjects. To verify the feasibility of the PSCSM in clinical applications, simulated images, actual single-spectrum mammograms, and multi-spectral MRIs were used to perform tumor segmentation tests for the PSCSM, and the results were compared with renowned, competitive segmentation techniques including ET, FCM, Otsu, LSM, and Snake. The results proved that the proposed PSCSM segmentation algorithm delivered significantly better performance than well-known existing algorithms. The results of this study can not only be used to enhance the accuracy of medical diagnoses, but also to facilitate further studies such as lesion localization, 3D reconstruction, benign or malignant tumor determination, and the establishment of a computer-aided diagnosis system.
