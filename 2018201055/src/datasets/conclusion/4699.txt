Sequencing effects such as primacy, recency, and the peak-end rule are known to influence people's recollection of experiences. Given their prevalence in the basic teachings of psychology, there has been relatively little research into sequencing effects in HCI.
We reviewed prior research on sequencing effects and presented new experimental results exploring these phenomena and demonstrating that recency effects can significantly influence user's preference for interfaces that are otherwise identical in their objective interaction requirements. Together, the extensive findings from psychology, limited prior findings in HCI, and the results reported in this paper show that recency effects offer designers an opportunity to improve usersâ€™ memories of their subjective experience. Conversely, failing to attend to the timing of negative interaction elements may cause much stronger adverse memories than anticipated. We advocate a better understanding of sequence effects as both an opportunity and a risk for interaction design and user experience.
