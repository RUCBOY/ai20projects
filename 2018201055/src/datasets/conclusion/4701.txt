As new features are being added in modern operating systems, the forensic analysis of these features requires new tools to be developed or existing tools need to be updated. Cortana as a new voice activated personal digital assistant is introduced in Microsoft Windows 10 desktop operating systems. This feature collects various pieces of a user's personalized data such as user's contacts, calendar, location, and Internet history to work more efficiently. This paper seeks to determine the in-depth understanding of the artifacts created by Cortana and their usage in digital forensic investigations.
The paper reveals several locations of artifacts created by Cortana in a Windows 10 PC, their format, and the information recorded in these artifacts. One of these artifacts is CortanaCoreDb.dat database that records information which can be leveraged in digital forensic investigations. The tables from this database can be parsed and exported to tab-delimited files using existing tools. As a part of this applied research, four custom python scripts have been developed to decode timestamp values and resolve foreign keys for converting data into human readable format. Moreover, a GUI tool called CortanaDigger has been developed for parsing and displaying web search keywords performed on Cortana box. The developed tool also aggregates and exports the parsed data into a SQLite format and is enabled to run SQL query from user interface to aid forensic investigations. Several experiments were conducted in three sets to evaluate forensic importance of Cortana artifacts in a Window 10 PC. It was found that the Cortana artifacts can provide significant information related to user activities on Cortana that may be helpful in digital forensic investigations.
