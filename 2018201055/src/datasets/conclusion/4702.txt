In this study, we investigated age associated SSVEP BCI performance differences by comparing results of a BCI spelling performance from two age groups. Experimental results based on twenty healthy subjects demonstrated that thanks to the implementation of large classification time windows (up to 16Â s), every subject gained control over the system with decent accuracies. However, commands were classified faster and more accurate for subjects of the young group. The significant performance difference (mean ITR of 27.36 bit/min compared to 16.19 bit/min for the young and elderly age group, respectively) needs to be considered already during the design phase of BCI systems. The results confirm that subject age influence BCI performance, and indicate that GUIs should be modified to fit the needs of elderly users.
