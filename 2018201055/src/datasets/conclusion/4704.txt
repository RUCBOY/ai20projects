Designing educational apps for mobile devices is an emerging area in computers and education, and so far little research has compared the effectiveness of computer-based simulations and mobile apps in learning science. To understand in what ways and for whom educational apps could be effective learning tools, this study examined the learning of students in three groups who used two versions of an app and one computer simulation, and investigated the effects of the simulation design, visual-motor integration, and spatial ability on the students' understanding of physics concepts. The results suggest that well-designed educational apps could narrow the performance gap between students with different levels of spatial ability. However, this study also raises a concern as to the impact of simulations and mobile apps on students with different VMI abilities. This study advances the current understanding of learning with mobile apps, and sheds light on the possible interactions between studentsâ€™ characteristics and simulation design.
