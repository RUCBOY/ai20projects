In this report, a new ensemble system for Cancer classification based on gene expression profiles was presented. The approach followed lead to a fast and adequate system that outperforms the ensemble system suggested by [1]. It also overcame the three addressed drawbacks; namely, enhancing result accuracy, covering more cancer types, and mitigating the effect of over-fitting.in this work, K-NN classifier has been used as a base member of the ensemble. In future work, more different classifiers can be used as base members. Moreover, this system can be applied to other benchmarks especially multiclass datasets.
