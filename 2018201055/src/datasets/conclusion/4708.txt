In this paper, we focused on the privacy issues of collaborative deep learning in cloud computing, and proposed two schemes, i.e.,Â  basic scheme and advanced scheme, to protect the privacy in deep learning. The basic scheme is based on a Mk-FHE scheme, and the advanced scheme is based on a hybrid structure, which combines the double decryption mechanism with FHE scheme. Both schemes are able to tackle the problem of privacy-preserving collaborative deep learning ciphertext with different public keys. Compared with the basic scheme, the advanced scheme does not need the interaction among the data owners during the decryption of the learning result. Our future work will be focused on two open problems: how to implement the FHE scheme in practical machine learning, and how to reduce the cost of computation and communication.
