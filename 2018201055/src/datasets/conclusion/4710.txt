We have demonstrated the utility of a highly performant OpenGL GPU-based software tool for the animated analysis of time-series geosciences data. The software has successfully interrogated a cloud-based data repository running a THREDDS data server, delivering requested data subsets of NetCDF files via OPeNDAP queries. Features include the ability to customise visual enhancements to aid feature identification by a human observer. Data throughflow may also be varied to match the desired analysis task and optimise human interaction. As a demonstration case study, our software has been used to characterise qualitatively a variety of different storm and non-storm events in Waverider Buoy data in a manner that complements conventional statistical analysis or static graphing.
Increasing volumes and complexities of data in the earth sciences demand new ways of interrogating the data, including the development of innovative forms of human-computer interaction that can facilitate discovery of underlying characteristics and patterns. The ability to interface highly-performant GPU-based OpenGL software with a cloud-hosted TDS system has broad applicability. Tagger extends the capability of visual analytics in a geosciences context.
