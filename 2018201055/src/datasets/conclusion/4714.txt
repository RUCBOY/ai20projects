In this paper, we build a security dependency network from access behaviors to quantify the security importance of system objects from a system-wide perspective. The security dependency network exhibits power-law degree distributions and small-world effect properties. Meanwhile, exploring networked structures in the dependency network provides us insights into the importance of system objects in security. We take advantage of centrality metrics to assess the importance of system objects with respect to integrity, and evaluate the importance metrics of system objects from various perspectives. Moreover, we propose an importance metric based behavioral model for malware detection. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the feasibility of the importance metrics and the efficacy of our malware detection method leveraging importance metrics.
