This study tested the displacement and complementarity hypotheses in the context of social media and public library use. Significant complementary relationships were found for all nine library services tested in all three nations. This suggests that predictions of the demise of libraries at the hands of social media, which is a common sentiment in public forums, are not likely to come to pass in the foreseeable future. Yet, this study also found hints of displacement effects. It is thus prudent not to dismiss the potential competition between social media and library use in certain user groups, especially as social media becomes more and more ubiquitous. These findings will be of use to policy makers and information professionals in shaping the future of public libraries. Continuous efforts investigating the public's perception and use of different information services will benefit the delivery of forward-looking, effective, and equitable library services for all segments of the population.
