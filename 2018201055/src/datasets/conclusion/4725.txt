The new conclusions drawn in this current work are summarized as follows:
(1)A novel approach, non-uniformity coefficient method, based on uniform design theory (namely star discrepancy measure) was proposed to measure the uniformity of temperature field. The proposed measure NUC illustrated by image analysis has several notable properties which make it suitable for uniformity characterization in a wide variety of temperature fields with different scales (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit, etc.) or widely different means. The evaluation value can be used as a benchmark for automatic decision marking.(2)Effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated on both the presented temperature field data and the real open imaging data. For temperature field, NUC is closely related to Nusselt numbers; For pressure field, NUC distinguishes between relatively more uneven and uniform; For concentration field, NUC is an effective tool to study mixing transient. Considering the location information of objects, it can be seen that the proposed method has the more accurate estimation, with compared with the existing methods previously introduced.(3)It is shown that this technique can be expanded and adapted to analysis measurements gradients in real-world applications, including the temperature field, pressure field, concentration field and velocity field. In general, it is immediately clear that the presented method is only applicable to rectangular region. However, this work presents an alternative route to exploring the field uniformity characterization.
