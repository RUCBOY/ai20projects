In this paper, we propose a new method to tackle difficult re-finding tasks, which actively collects a user’s memory pieces about a document, then exploits the information to filter out the quested document. We argue that if the user remembers the existence of a document, he should remember some specialties of it that differentiate it from other documents, such as the keywords or folder of it. In a difficult re-finding scenario, the formulated keywords and path usually fail to locate the target. We introduce new attributes like “Coverage percentage”, “Access frequency”, “Number of images”, and “Number of tables”, which may serve as specialties of a document to locate it. To alleviate the user’s cognitive burden during memory recollection, we employ a divide-and-conquer strategy with a Q&A wizard interface to split an intractable question into small steps. A PDF document re-finding system is developed to verify the feasibility of the method. A user study shows the PDF document re-finding system can attain 52% of difficult re-finding tasks when conventional methods fail. 90% of participants confirm the Q&A wizard interface can alleviate their cognitive burden during recollecting. Further extension of the system involves re-finding other file types (e.g., multimedia files), in which case some attributes should be substituted by other attributes like genre or duration etc.
