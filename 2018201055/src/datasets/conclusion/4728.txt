To deal with the nonlinear deformations in face shapes from face images, we make use of a sequence of Recurrent Neural Networks and Feed-forward Neural Networks in a coarse-to-fine architecture to figure out the problem. The first global network using RNN directly map the input of face image in a low resolution to the estimated face shape. Then the subsequent local network takes the components of faces as inputs based on the output of the first network to get more accurate landmark locations with a higher resolution. Finally, a local network adjusts the results by extracting a small patch from each landmark and refining all landmarks jointly. By making full use of the time-series data, our method get impressive results when dealing with face images in videos. What's more, by using more image information from RGB channels or enhanced images, our method also achieve good results on still images. The effectiveness of our method is validated on three databases in both wild and indoor conditions compared with the state-of-the-art methods, such as CFAN, SDM, TCDCN and RCPR.
Our method validates the effectiveness of RNN in dealing with the task of facial landmark detection. However, our method also needs the bounding boxes from the face detection tool. In the future, we will attempt to construct an end-to-end face alignment network which doesnâ€™t rely on the results of face detections.
