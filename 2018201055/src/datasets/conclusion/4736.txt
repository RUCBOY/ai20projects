In this paper, we propose a new method based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to perform feature extraction and classification for MI EEG signal. According to the spatio-temporal characteristics of EEG, a 5-layer CNN model is built to classify MI tasks (left hand and right hand). The results demonstrate that CNN can further improve classification performance compared with other three conventional methods. The present study shows that the proposed method is effective to classify MI, and provides a practical method by non-invasive EEG signal in BCI applications.
