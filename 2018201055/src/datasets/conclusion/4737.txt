This kind of re-use and re-purposing of workflow fragments across different data domains can be generalized to other scientific fields and allows scientists to link across different disciplines  [2], [5]. For example, in geosciences, researchers observe the surface of the Earth at critical points and examine moisture levels from above and below. This, in turn, depends closely on weather models, models of soil, rain, etc. Thus, they also need to use approaches from many different disciplines to analyze data from multiple domains. Examples such as this also abound in Biology  [5], particularly in Proteomics and Genomics.
In this work, we only illustrate re-use of our workflow fragments by ourselves and our collaborators, not by third parties  [6]. However, this paper does illustrate the potential for reuse of workflow fragments and, if they are shared with other researchers, more scientists can use such workflow fragments in their own applications instead of having to re-implement them or, even worse, forego such an analysis. One of the issues involved with sharing workflow fragments is the open question of how to describe them so they are re-usable by others. We intend to examine this in future work where one promising approach is to use a Component Ontology by function as an aspect  [48]: i.e., being able to find workflow fragments according to a user query to search for a specific kind of component that is retrieved for the user; we can also find workflow fragments by typing about them in English  [49].
