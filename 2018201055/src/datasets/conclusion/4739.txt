In this study, we implemented a semantically-based query recommendation feature in an EHR search engine. We then empirically evaluated its performance by having 33 experienced users perform a set of simulated EHR search tasks with the feature turned off vs. with it turned on. The results show that semantically-based query recommendation has great potential to improve both the information retrieval performance of the search engine and time efficiency for end users. These findings may be generalized to search engines for other types of healthcare text, such as biomedical literature, forum messages, and insurance claims. We therefore encourage other EHR search engines, and other healthcare information retrieval systems in general, to consider incorporating this feature.
