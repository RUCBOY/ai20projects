The prize-collecting Steiner tree problem in graphs (PCSPG) and its rooted version (RPCST) are both target problems of the recent 11th DIMACS Implementation Challenge (2014) [29]. In this paper, we proposed a knowledge-guided iterated local search approach named K-ILS for solving both the PCSPG and the RPCST. K-ILS combines several key search strategies, including a swap-vertex move operator associated with an auxiliary evaluation function which are shown to be very useful for some extremely challenging instances with uniform or nearly uniform edge costs, as well as several knowledge-guided perturbation strategies, which are highly effective on various types of instances. We also designed two original path-based move operators. Experimental results showed that K-ILS is able to improve our previous KTS algorithm [15], which was ranked the first place or tied the first place on five of the eight main subcategories where it was involved during the 11th DIMACS Implementation Challenge. Finally, we performed additional experiments to investigate the impact of several key components over the performance of the proposed algorithm.
One notices that the idea of the swap-vertex operator could be adapted to several other Steiner tree problems, such as the classical Steiner tree problem and the maximum-weight connected subgraph problem. Finally, this work confirms that it is a good practice to consider characteristics of problem instances when designing search strategies. Such a design could be applied to other settings where relevant instance features can be identified and effectively explored by search procedures.
