The present contribution had a limited scope, i.e. to deliver a personal account on a subject and not to write down a comprehensive scientific review. The field of spatially resolved EELS has tremendously progressed over the past four decades, as is schematically illustrated in figure 11 of reference [32]. In a spatial resolution, energy resolution coordinate system, it started from about (1 nm, 1 eV) in the mid-sixties and it has now reached a domain of typically (0.1 nm, 0.1 eV) or (1 nm, 0.01 eV) with huge potentialities in terms of elemental mapping and bond mapping in the first case or of plasmonics and phononics in the second. For sure, over this period, Ondrej Krivanek, who had made up his mind immediately following our first encounter and exchange, has beautifully paved the way in electron energy-loss spectroscopy and associated techniques. I can fully testify to it. And to end, I have selected the picture, shown in Fig. 9, which was recorded during the final presidential session at the ICM meeting in Prague, when he was awarded with the Vernon E. Cosslett medal of the IFSM (International Federation of Societies of Microscopy. With all my congratulations to Ondrej!
