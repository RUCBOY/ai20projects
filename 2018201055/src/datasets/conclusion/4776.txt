It could be said that statistically CTS is a valid and reliable scale that could be used in the identification of the computational thinking levels of students. Since there has not been encountered a valid and reliable measurement tool aiming at measuring the computational thinking levels as a whole in the literature, it could be thought that this measurement tool could make important contributions to literature. However, the validity and the readability of the scale should be done to use it for different groups and purposes. It should be considered that each scale can be valid and reliable for its own group. Besides, the validity and reliability studies of the measurement tool have been conducted by the participation of 1306 participants consisting of the students studying at different associate, undergraduate and post graduate degrees and graduated from undergraduate degrees and having pedagogical formation. That the participants are from different education levels and age groups has given an opportunity to use the scale in different groups. However, it is suggested that the validity and reliability analysis are done again when it is wanted to be used in the groups in the scope of the study. On the other hand, five factor point obtained from the scale could be used separately; it could also be used as total point.
However; this study is limited to the associate students and the students studying in higher levels. Adaptation study should be conducted in the event that this study is desired to be applied to the high school students or the students in lower grades. In addition; computational thinking is limited to the sub-skills expressed in the definition made by ISTE (2015) in this scale and to the basic items taking place in the scales developed separately for these skills.
