The main objective of this study was conducted from the automatic implementation of the cross-stitch embroidery. The recognition of the weave holes in cross-stitch pattern was modeled as the alignment of grid points in the raster like pattern. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) In case of checkerboard pattern, we designed an algorithm to align the grid points. (2) Comparison results demonstrated that our method is more robust to geometrical distortion and pose change. (3) The proposed method was used to recognize the weave holes in cross-stitch pattern. The method addressed its potential application to implement the cross-stitch embroidery in an automatic way.
