The study found that the process of legalising medical cannabis appears to be driven less by scientific evidence and more by political considerations. While the notion that scientific evidence should play a major role in influencing medical cannabis policy is ideal, it is not realistic in the sense that there are other factors which play a role in the process and which need to be taken into consideration. The factors should not be interpreted individually as they do not make the policy process on their own, but are rather part of a complex, interactive, and ongoing process, dependent on context and time.
If cannabis is not rescheduled in the near future, then attention needs to turn to how the evidence can be used to assure that effective medical cannabis laws are passed. While it is unlikely that a consensus on the required evidence needed to change laws will ever be reached, this study suggests that a more systematic effort towards educating the public and the policymakers is needed. This could potentially be achieved by working collaboratively with policy makers to provide the knowledge they need to improve how laws are written and implemented.
