The most outstanding outcome of the ICT-based experiment conducted has been a noticeable improvement in the grades obtained by the students in the final examination of the subject. The use of key programming patterns has also proved to be extremely helpful for mastering difficult CPP concepts and syntactical constructs. In addition, as students are now more actively involved in theory classes, lessons are more effective and students make better use of their time and gain a better understanding of concurrency topics.
This ICT-based interactive teaching approach can easily be applied to other courses in many different areas beyond the sphere of normal university courses. Teaching projects such as massive open online courses (MOOC) could immediately benefit from our approach on many of their engineering courses since such courses usually follow design patterns that students must adapt to specific device implementation and the implementation of our method would only require a simple adaptation of specific course content.
By way of future work, we intend to develop complete pattern libraries using Java, C ++ and C # languages and MPI to provide our students with a smooth transition from the pattern to code development with any of these only with the basic knowledge that these patterns entail. Each pattern also has a series of tests with selected test data to enable students to discover the most common cases in addition to applications that cause problems and the solutions to be applied.
In the long term, we intend to develop a pattern-based CPP teaching tool in the Cloud which would facilitate systematic learning for any student or person interested and which would enable the method and techniques discussed in this paper to be implemented.
