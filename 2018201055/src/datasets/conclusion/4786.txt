In this article, an approach for the identification and classification of diseases in the citrus plants is presented. we used Î”E (Delta E) segmentation method, RGB, HSV (color histogram) and LBP (textural) as descriptors on our collected images. We applied both image level as well as disease level classification. Moreover, Fine KNN, Cubic SVM, Boosted tree and Bagged tree ensemble classification methods are used. We found that Bagged tree ensemble classifier performs better by using any color features as compared to other classifiers. Furthermore, LBP features have more discriminative power for image level classification. Color features have good disease level discrimination if Bagged tree ensemble classifier is used. The overall classification results show 99% accuracy, 1.0 area under the curve and 99.7% sensitivity. Thus, this system facilitates the agriculturalist and farmers to undertake smart farming and allowing them to detect diseases as early as possible. Furthermore, this will make them capable of adopting the decision to improve yield by taking necessary precautions, preventions and correct measures to improve the health of citrus orchards. The accuracy of our results can improved using more training example. Our proposed methodology can be utilized in detection of diseases in other plants with the collaboration of respective domain experts. We intend to develop a mobile application that is based on proposed technique for direct benefits of the farmer. There is still a need of standard publically available datasets to improve the overall performance of such systems and making the computer aided diagnosis systems more wide-ranging, which are capable of detecting and classifying different diseases more accurately.
