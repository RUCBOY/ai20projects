In general terms, the proposed system provides a feasible solution to visual monitoring of horticultural crops, for the final purpose of water balance estimation and precise irrigation scheduling. A set of inexpensive capture modules can be located in sparse locations of a crop, each of them powered by photovoltaic panels and connected to one, or several, routers which provide communication with the Internet. A cloud computing server controls these modules and collects all the information, performing the necessary computer vision algorithms to estimate the state of the crop and its water balance. The system is available for the farm manager and any authorized user, from any location and device with a web browser.
The process can be understood as a kind of virtual sensor, where models are utilized to estimate features from low-cost measurements. The experimental results have shown that the proposed methodology provides an excellent accuracy in PGC and Kc estimation and, therefore, in water balance computation. The error in PGC is below 5% in the studied crop of lettuce, and the Kc achieves a 0.6% error using correctly calibrated equations. Some other advantages of this approach are its scalability, integration and adaptability to different use cases.
Currently, the system is designed as a tool for providing information to farm managers, who can perform a frequent and precise monitoring of the crops. However, the final irrigation decision rests with the human expert, according to the available information and his/her knowledge and experience. As a future research line, the automation of the irrigation scheduling should be studied. This calculation would have the requisite to minimize water consumption, while maximizing crop productivity, depending of each plant species and incorporating agroclimatic data. It could work as a completely automated system or as a decision support system for the manager.
