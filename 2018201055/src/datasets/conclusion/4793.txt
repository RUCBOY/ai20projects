Storage class memory technologies present new opportunities for improving the performance of computer systems. In this paper, we have proposed BSS based on the DRAM-SCM architecture. We provide both architectural and operating system support for SCM in future high performance PCM-based computer systems. BSS and the DRAM-SCM architectures adopt a new hybrid CPU mode in MMU and expose SCM directly to the CPU via privileged instructions. BSS provides a block device interface to allow users of SCM to use existing file systems, saving tremendous migration efforts. A new, simplified SCM access model is also proposed for future expansion.
Our experimental results show that with BSS and the DRAM-SCM architectures, I/O performance for accessing large files is greatly improved. The performance for accessing small files is comparable to that for traditional hard disk drives at best efforts. It opens tremendous opportunities in related areas to prove the feasibility and improve the performance by adopting memory-attached PCM as a storage device. Further enhancement on the simplified SCM access model is also a promising area to work on as it could potentially provide better performance in more concise programming model. We also plan to extend the DRAM-SCM architecture and BSS for better scalability and reliability, including enhancement in endurance and power consumption, which may require different architectural and operating system support strategies. In addition, we also plan to investigate other system architectures that may not fit current DRAM-SCM model. For example, new address mapping strategies and virtual memory management policies are necessary for storage class memory with multiple heterogenous devices.
