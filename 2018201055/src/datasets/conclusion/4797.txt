An error in the assumed or measured volume of a low-density material has the potential to produce large errors in the calculated gas uptake for that material in a Sieverts apparatus. This error increases with increasing pressure [9]. However the sensitivity of an apparatus to the uncertainty in the sample volume can be minimised by making the reference and sample cell volumes approximately equal and both large compared to the sample volume, preferably by a factor of >100. This necessitates high accuracy pressure measurements.
Here we have reported the construction of a computer driven Sieverts apparatus that can measure isotherms up to 300 bar and from 77 K to 673 K which has been specifically designed for carbons, especially porous carbons as well as other low density materials. The high pressure is achieved by gas compression with a computer–driven piston pump. Control of the apparatus is achieved via a computer program that monitors and controls the instrument, records data and plots adsorption isotherms as they are performed.
The apparatus has been shown to have a low-sensitivity to lack of accurate knowledge of the volume of low-density materials. H2 adsorption isotherms at 77 K and 296 K were measured up to 300 bar on a commercial activated carbon with a measured density of 1.96 g/cm3. An N2 isotherm was measured at 77 K to a saturation pressure of ∼1 bar with application of the BET equation yielding a surface area of 988 m2, in agreement with the literature. The comparison of the isotherm for the activated carbon Takeda 4A with isotherms measured in the round-robin suggests that the described instrument is authoritative.
