The ternary scrambling operators can be used in digital coding for transmission of high capacitance signals without loss of information. Two new ternary operators have been presented in this paper exclusively and efficiently applicable for scrambling applications. The employment of the proposed operatorsleads to reduction in the number of decoding steps, equivalent to one operator for each digit of received data in the receiver side, in contrast with the other existing operator (SUM). Through the entire explanations of the paper and simulation results, we conclude that ScramOp2 is the most efficient operator for scrambling. Not only does it provide gate-level efficiency in the specified scrambling and descrambling methods, in comparison with SUM, but its transistor-level design also brings about higher performance.
