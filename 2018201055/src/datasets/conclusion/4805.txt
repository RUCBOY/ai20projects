Considering its advantages in the addition operation in TOC, this article mainly presents the SMSD encoding method by classifying and reducing the mapping relations between normal MSD number and the corresponding SMSD number. Meanwhile, the optical paths and the converter are designed. Through these optical converters, SMSD number can be easily obtained from MSD number. Simulation results show that the simplified conversion rules can much reduce the conversion complexity, and the optical paths and the converter for SMSD number are correct. They are feasible and effective in SMSD number conversion. Application the converter in the one-step adder, addition operation can be implemented more efficiently which might replace the existing three-step MSD adder in TOC. This will much speed up the working efficiency of TOC in numerical computation applications.
