In this article, our novel contribution is to propose a hybrid method for accurate and fast classification of maxillofacial cysts. An effective feature extraction approach is introduced for discriminating three classes of maxillofacial cysts. The proposed framework based on orthogonalized SPHARM and contourlet features achieved classification accuracies of 94.29% and 96.48% using SVM and SDA classifiers. It was experimentally shown that orthogonalized SPHARM features outperform conventional SPHARM features. Orthogonalized SPHARM coefficients are well suited for classification tasks because they provide an orthogonal multi-scale representation and thus different features correspond to different levels of detail. Furthermore, the proposed approach is not restricted to maxillofacial cysts and it could be applied to other anatomical structures. It was demonstrated that orthogonalized SPHARM features can offer several advantages and better performance over conventional SPHARM. Spherical Harmonics suffer from global support of basis functions and lack of efficiency for representing high-frequency data. Therefore, the bases are not efficient in processing all-frequency signals, especially in medical image applications. In our future works, we will explore the application of other basis functions.
