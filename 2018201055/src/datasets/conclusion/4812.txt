We obtained non-trivial lower and upper bound on f(n,P,d) when n is large for block permutation matrices P. In particular, we established the tight bound Θ(nd−1) on f(n,P,d) for every d-dimensional tuple permutation matrix P. We improved the previous upper bound on the limit superior of the sequence {f(n,P,d)nd−1} for all permutation and tuple permutation matrices. We showed that the limit inferior is exponential in k for a family of k×⋯×k permutation matrices.
One possible direction for future research would be to prove the convergence of the sequence {f(n,P,d)nd−1} for permutation and tuple permutation matrices P. By the results of Section 3, this sequence is bounded. If we can establish the super-homogeneity f(sn,P,d)≥sd−1f(n,P,d), we can then use a Fekete-like lemma to show the convergence of the sequence.
