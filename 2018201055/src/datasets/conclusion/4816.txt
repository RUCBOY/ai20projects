This paper has analyzed the feasibility of using Docker containers to support the creation of virtual elastic computer clusters for the execution of scientific applications. These clusters maintain the very same interfaces for end users but benefit from the reduced overheads introduced by containers. For this, we introduced the open-source EC4Docker tool to support the deployment of such clusters on a Container Orchestration Platform managed by Docker Swarm.
We have demonstrated the feasibility of adopting containers to execute scientific applications, introducing two main advantages when compared to traditional VMs: (i) the low deploying times for new working nodes, and (ii) potential reductions in the overhead caused by VMs in CPU, memory and storage, offering near-native performance. Moreover, from the discussed case study, we can conclude that container-based virtual clusters are an appropriate solution for the execution of short HTC tasks.
Future work involves the automatization of the generation of the container images that EC4Docker uses to deploy the cluster. Currently, the administrator or the users need to generate their own images including the Dockerfile provided with EC4Docker in order to deploy their own applications in the container cluster environment. A service will be implemented to facilitate this process for non-experienced users. Finally, a thorough scalability testing will be carried out to quantify the benefits of the container technology versus virtual machines for the processing of jobs on scientific computing virtual clusters.
