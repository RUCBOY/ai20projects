This paper investigated the use of deep learning to harvest discriminatory features from leaf images by learning, and apply them as classifiers for plant identification. Our experimental results demonstrate that learning the features using CNNs can provide better feature representations of leaf images as compared to using hand-crafted features. We also quantified the features that most efficiently represent the leaves for the purpose of species identification, using a DN approach. In the first experiment we show that venation structure is a very important feature for identification especially when shape feature alone is inadequate. This is verified by checking the global response of the filters in each convolution layer using the V1 strategy. We furthermore quantified the leaf image features by examining the local response of individual filters in each convolution layer. We observed a hierarchical transformation of features from low-level to high-level abstraction throughout the convolution layer, and these findings fit the hierarchical botanical definitions of leaf characters. Finally, we introduce new hybrid models, exploiting the correspondence of different contextual information of leaf features. We show experimentally that hybrid local-global features learned using DL can improve recognition performance compared to previous techniques.
