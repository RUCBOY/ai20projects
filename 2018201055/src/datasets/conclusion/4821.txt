Although the present study found empirical evidence for the positive relations of ICT-related behavioral and motivational characteristics with the frequency of use of ICT for social communication among early adolescents in 20 ICILS participating countries, potentially pathological or addictive use of ICT may adversely affect their physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development (see Sim, Gentile, Bricolo, Serpelloni, & Gulamoydeen, 2012). Because healthy development during early adolescence is complex and fraught with both challenges and opportunities, both parents and schools may need to conscientiously educate early adolescents about the potential risks the problematic or maladaptive engagement with specific ICT tools or applications can bring about in their lives. Such concerted efforts on the part of their families and schools may help them to become healthy users and critical consumers of ICT tools, services, and applications.
