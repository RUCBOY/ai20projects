Combining the polarimetric imaging technique and dark channel prior technique, we propose a novel method for enhancing the visibility of images taken in haze conditions. First, the sky region is extracted automatically by the dark channel prior technique, which can ensure the accuracy of A∞ estimation. Second, the DOP and AOP of the airlight are calculated with the pixels selected by the dark channel prior technique. This can improve the estimation accuracy of the airlight radiance. These processes can be realized automatically operating on the whole hazy image. It means that we do not need to extract the sky region from the scene manually. Furthermore, the key point of our method is that a dynamic bias factor ε is introduced for correcting the deviation of the transmission t by use of the evaluation function–Entropy. It ensures that the best dehazed image can be finally obtained while not involving any other human-computer interaction during the dehazing process. Experiments indicate that our method can not only effectively enhance the image visibility but also preserve the details of image considerably for thin, medium and dense haze conditions. Especially for dense haze condition, the flexibility and automaticity of our method is more important and beneficial.
It should be noticed that we have assumed that the object light scattered by haze particles is non-polarized light. However, the object light scattered by haze particles may be partially polarized light, this leads to some restriction on enhancing the visibility further. More concentration should be focused on the object light property scattered by haze particles.
