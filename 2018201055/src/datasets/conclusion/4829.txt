The results of this study suggest that high exposure to an electronic media device may have an impact on the sleep-wake cycle of adolescents, regardless of their school shift. Adolescents from the afternoon shift reported more time spent on all of the electronic media devices, greater daytime sleepiness with the use of computer, MP3 player, and television, as well as a tendency towards eveningness with the use of the computer, smartphone, and MP3 player.
It is important to carry out awareness programs regarding adequate sleep schedules among adolescents. Further, lectures should be presented in schools from primary education to university to inform children and adolescents about the effects and consequences of having a high exposure of an electronic media device during nighttime before going to sleep. Finally, it is crucial that parents be involved in these programs to ensure they understand the potential impact of these devices on their child's health.
