In this paper, we propose a stereo handwriting character recognition algorithm using binocular cameras. The user can write characters in various directions using the defined valid and null gestures. These gestures are efficient in finding what should be recorded about the users' hand movements. This avoids redundant computation. After detecting valid gestures, we exploit disparity between two images taken by stereo camera to obtain stereo spatial location in which depth is paid more attention to. Then we get the characters written by the users in the air. The proposed algorithm can be a good application for medical use.
