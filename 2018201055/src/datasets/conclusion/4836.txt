We have presented a large-scale study of how Java’s language syntax is used in practice using more than 5,000 open-source Java projects. Our study has exposed interesting quantitative information to help understand how Java’s syntactic rules have been used, both individually and considering contextual dependencies. This work enables and promotes a data-driven approach to language design.
There are several interesting directions for future work. First, we plan to conduct a more comprehensive study with other programming languages to increase the external validity of our findings. Second, we are interested in investigating the possibility of using rule dependencies to facilitate syntax-based code completion. Third, we plan to provide additional suggestions on improving language design, e.g. by constructing more easy-to-use syntactic sugar. Finally, we would like to understand how different language syntax features are used from more perspectives, e.g. does the number of developers in the project correlate with the number of rules used; does the project category affect the distribution of the rule usage; does the adoption of one or several specific rules improve the defect rate and reduce the code quality.
