In this paper, we have proposed a deep cumulatively and comparatively (D2C) supervised age estimation model. To combat the sample imbalance problem we proposed a novel cumulative hidden layer which is supervised by a point-wise cumulative signal. By incorporating this cumulative hidden layer, our model can not only learn from one face itself but also from faces with nearby ages. This alleviates the sample imbalance problem effectively. In order to learn more discriminative aging features, we further propose a novel comparative ranking layer which is supervised by a pair-wise comparative signal. This comparative ranking layer facilitates aging feature learning and further improves the age estimation performance. Our D2C age estimation model is evaluated on two of the largest benchmark datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin. The network used in this work is relatively shallow compared with modern very deep architectures. Future work will investigates the use of deeper networks to improve estimates of age.
