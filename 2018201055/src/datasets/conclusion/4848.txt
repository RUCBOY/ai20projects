Mobile technologies based on cloud computing open new avenues through which students with dyslexia can learn. However, a large amount of work is required in this area. To improve the educational performances of students with dyslexia, the authors have developed a multimodal m-learning tool based on cloud computing technology. This proposed tool provides convenient data input and output, enabling students with dyslexia to learn material and complete exercises. The proposed tool can be adapted to fit each student's profile and preferred learning style through the use of a multimodal function that is provided in different formats (images, audio, and text). Students can also interact with content through different modes. The implications of this study reveal that the multimodality function is an excellent environment for supporting the needs of students with dyslexia, enhancing the learning progress of students with dyslexia by almost 30%. Additionally, this study shows that the proposed tool provides a user-friendly interface that encourages the students to use it for learning and that it has a very attractive presentation that eliminates boredom. Moreover, the content of the learning materials is designed correctly based on approved pedagogical standards from the Ministry of Education. Additionally, the tool considers all of the students' needs and the differences among them to cover a larger possible segment of dyslexic students and promotes students' learning motivations and interests in reading learning by providing some helpful mechanisms to aid their reading ability.
