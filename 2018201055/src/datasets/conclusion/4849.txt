In this paper, we proposed a new spatial weighting algorithm applied to the space of covariance matrices based on Riemannian geometry. This weight function adjusts the impact of spatial features which are extracted from each covariance matrix on the decision boundary of a NN classifier. The presented method is tested on dataset IIa from BCI competition IV, and outperforms the conventional CSP method in multi class mental tasks classification for seven subjects out of nine. Furthermore, the results show that our proposed geometric mean is a better approximation of the true Riemannian mean of covariance matrices that is used for the tangent space mapping in the next step, compared to the currently available estimation in the literature for majority of subjects. This shows that handling subject-dependent noise in a simple way improves the performance of Riemannian scheme notably.
The proposed method is robust to outliers and it is suitable for other applications where covariance matrices are the main descriptor of the underlying data. This study reveals that choosing between CSP based algorithms versus Riemannian framework is a subject-dependent question, which needs more investigation in the future.
Last but not least, time complexity of training the geometric means for each class is 40Â s using Matlab R2008b on a device with CPU: Intel, 2 Duo 2.53 GHZ, 4 GB internal memory RAM and Windows 8 pro, which is quite fast for the training phase. The required time for classifying each test frame is less than one second.
