MAPIT confirms that a motivational computer program can improve short-term treatment initiation among substance-using probationers. The start of probation is a critical time to educate and motivate clients, and to provide a platform for developing goals that will help address substance use and other risk behaviors. Our study demonstrated that this can be accomplished without additional burdens on the criminal justice system, such as hiring or training staff. Overall, our findings suggest that a computerized intervention can help address public safety and health issues among this high-risk group.
