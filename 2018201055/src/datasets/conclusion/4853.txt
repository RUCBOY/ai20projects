In this paper a spectral domain feature extraction algorithm for face recognition is proposed, which effectively exploits the local spatial variations in a face image. For the purpose of feature extraction, initially face part is extracted from the original image using Viola-Jones algorithm and is converted into 120 × 120 pixels size gray scale image. A novel framework for calculating the polar Fourier transform to obtain dominant magnitude spectral features from pre-processed face image is presented. Initially 2D-DFT is performed on the pre-processed image to generate DFT spectrum and only low frequency components are retained. Further, redundant FFT coefficients are removed from the new DFT spectrum. Next, polar FFT is employed on non-redundant FFT coefficients to calculate frequency values in more accurate and faster way. The calculated polar DFT coefficients are converted into 1D P-FFT. The maximum value of the dominant magnitudes of 1D P-FFT is used and a new symbolic representation of face image is devised. For the analysis of symbolic faces, a new version of the content based symbolic similarity measure is developed and employed for symbolic data analysis of trained symbolic data object and test symbolic data object. Because of the use of polar FFT, the proposed approach is not only efficient, but also is more accurate than the other methods based on Cartesian Fourier Transform. The proposed symbolic modeling approach not only provides new way of representing features, also increases recognition accuracy. A detailed analysis of the results obtained on AR, ORL and LFW databases are presented and are compared with some of the other recently reported methods and the performance of the method proposed in this work is satisfactory.
