In this study, a new effective learning scheme, CMFOFS-KELM, has been proposed for KELM. This new scheme has been successfully applied to the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and breast cancer. This paper proposes a new CMFO approach, in order to maximize the generalization capability of the KELM classifier by simultaneously addressing the parameter setting and feature selection. The experimental results of the two common disease diagnosis problems have demonstrated that KELM based on the CMFO learning strategy has significant advantages over other competitive KELM methods constructed by the original MFO, PSO and GA, in terms of a set of performance metrics. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed CMFOFS-KELM may be treated as a valuable decision support tool.
