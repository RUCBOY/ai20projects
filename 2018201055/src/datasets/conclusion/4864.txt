A brief educational intervention produced gains in several domains of OD knowledge, and particularly knowledge of effective response to an OD in absence of naloxone, among patients being treated for OUD in a detoxification unit. The educational intervention was also associated with decreases in the important OD risk behavior “using while alone”, and was rated highly by participants for clarity and importance. A computerized delivery method may be increasingly feasible and acceptable with advances in technology infrastructure, with promise for a broad dissemination platform that can circumvent logistical barriers associated with in-person trainings and potential under-utilization of information delivered via written materials. Overall, the opioid OD educational prevention intervention, whether delivered as a stand-alone service or as a complement to naloxone training, fills an important gap in the continuum of resources available for combating the opioid OD epidemic.
