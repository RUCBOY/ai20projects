This paper develops a new framework, which tries to measure the interior and the exterior of a community based on a same metric, complete graph model. We partition a network into subnetworks by maximizing the difference between the interior and the exterior of subnetworks. The experimental results indicate that our approach obtains better results for community detection, is capable of splitting irregular networks and achieves perfect results on the karate network and the dolphin network. In the future work, we will study biological networks based on our framework and try to uncover important functional units with well-supported biological significance.
