The prevalence of OW and OB was 25.9% and 10.9%, respectively, while the combined one was 36.8%; 11.4% of students were underweight. All demographic variables had an insignificant (P > 0.05) effect on W_C. Meanwhile, there was a significant link between gender, academic year and discipline and BMI. Although 48.2% of students admitted that they were physical inactive, this effect was insignificant on both indicators. Smoking, stress, duration of TV viewing, and daylight and night sleep had an effect on BMI and W_C, but this was statistically insignificant. Breakfast, light meals, eating with a family, fast food, and regular and diet soft drinks had an insignificant effect on BMI. All eating habits tested had insignificant effect on W_C. A considerable relationship was observed between consumption of liver and BMI. Meat, egg, milk, fruit and vegetable and grain intake had no significant effect on BMI.
