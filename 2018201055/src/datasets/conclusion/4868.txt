Parental report of placing limitations on child SV and having negative attitudes toward it were associated with lower levels of reported TV viewing and weekend computer use among parents. Having negative attitudes toward child SV were also associated with lower levels of smartphone/tablet use and weekend total sedentary time among parents. However, parents' self-efficacy for limiting child SV and setting SV rules were not associated with either self-reported SV or accelerometer-assessed sedentary time.
