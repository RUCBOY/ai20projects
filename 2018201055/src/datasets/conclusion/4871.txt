Using a fixation guide in addition to a cutting guide makes mandibular reconstruction more accurate in positioning bone segments. The Cl position is especially well corrected when using a fixation guide compared with the outcomes achieved without one. When a CAD/CAM-designed cutting guide is used, we recommend using a fixation guide for more accuracy.
