In this paper, we have presented a novel framework to generate the SAIs using a mobile camera-IMU system that moves on a planar surface. We believe that this approach can provide users a more flexible and inexpensive way to generate the see-through-occlusion images than the conventional camera array based approaches. While the main limitation of our approach is the need of an extra planar surface during capturing, this limitation is alleviated when the method is applied to outdoor scenes. There are also some failure cases due to insufficient pixel correspondences between frames. In the future, since the computation load in our approach is low, we plan to implement the proposed method as an app for mobile devices, e.g., Android phones and iPhones. We also plan to further relax the co-planar constraint when moving the tablet in our future work.
