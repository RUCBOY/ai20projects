VQA is an important basic research problem in computer vision and natural language processing that requires a system to do much more than task specific algorithms, such as object recognition and object detection. An algorithm that can answer arbitrary questions about images would be a milestone in artificial intelligence. We believe that VQA should be a necessary part of any visual Turing test.
In this paper, we critically reviewed existing datasets and algorithms for VQA. We discussed the challenges of evaluating answers generated by algorithms, especially multi-word answers. We described how biases and other problems plague existing datasets. This is a major problem, and the field needs a dataset that evaluates the important characteristics of a VQA algorithm, so that if an algorithm performs well on that dataset then it means it is doing well on VQA in general.
Future work on VQA involves the creation of larger and far more varied datasets. Bias in these datasets will be difficult to overcome, but evaluating different kinds of questions individually in a nuanced manner, rather than using naive accuracy alone, will help significantly. Further work will be needed to develop VQA algorithms that can reason about image content, but these algorithms may lead to significant new areas of research.
