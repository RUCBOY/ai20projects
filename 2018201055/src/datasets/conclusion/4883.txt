There are visual differences in the image frames of celiac disease patients versus controls, which can be automatically learned via deep learning techniques. The deep learning network can be used to distinguish the frames of celiac disease patients from those of control subjects. A quantitative measurement for severity level, which we termed evaluation confidence (EC), was introduced in this study. The results according to this evaluation confidence were found to be promising, achieving a 100% level of sensitivity and specificity in the testing set. This computer-aided technique may therefore be helpful to eliminate the bias of the clinician during evaluation for the presence of mucosal villous atrophy and also broaden the applicability of capsule endoscopy to other etiologies for real-time assessment. Automatic detection of Marsh types is being developed in further studies by collecting and analyzing larger numbers of video clips from celiac patients and control subjects.
