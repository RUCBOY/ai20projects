With a vision to see smart and adaptive green objects and components be part of green software programs in the future, we have detailed a concept and an architecture and developed a prototype for building adaptive green data structures that can intelligently adapt for energy efficiency. We provide empirical evidence that there exists energy saving opportunities in C5 dynamic data structures, which may be present in other interface-based, object-oriented dynamic data structures as well. Using a “select the right data structure for the right workload” approach, we demonstrate how the selection process of the C5 data structures can be automated with machine learning tools such as Artificial Neural Networks and n-gram based predictors. The validation results show that the models can accurately classify and predict data structures for energy efficient computing.
Our green data structure prototype, GreenC5, demonstrates that the concept can actually be implemented. Our simple decision making technique can help GreenC5 to decide when to transform for energy efficiency. The predictive models can help the data structure to know how to adapt by correctly transforming to different data structure choices. The result shows that GreenC5 can efficiently adapt for energy efficiency with low overhead. The a priori knowledge can potentially be universal where only one single model is needed and can be used in different machines, improving the user-friendliness of the data structure. The work can also be applied in other interface-based objects and is an essential groundwork for building fully functional adaptive green data structures in the future.
