Nowadays, the research community in health informatics is focusing its attention in approaches to support doctors and general practitioners in their job of recognizing pathologies from a series of evidences collected from the patients, with the aim of reducing the probability of misdiagnosis. The problem of misdiagnosis is more serious if we consider that some pathologies can affect infants and leave them permanent deformations and/or health problems, which can be avoided with the early diagnosis of the pathologies and by assuming proper corrective, even simple, actions at the early stage of the pathology. In order to reduce the costs caused by misdiagnosis and improve the probability of early diagnosis of pathologies in infants, hospitals and medical practices are turning their attention to clinical Decision Support Systems (DSS), to assist them in diagnosing pathologies based on the symptoms manifesting in the patients.
To deal with the above issues, we defined a method for the collaborative clinical analysis of a patient, which involves the acquisition of data, along with the detection and characterization of pathologies by a group of experts. More precisely, we have applied such a methodology to the problem of early recognition of craniofacial pathologies in infants, but the methodology is generic enough for being applied to several types of disease. After running our detection approach, each expert has performs a multi-criteria assessment of the received input, where a digit and a severity degree have been associated to each assessment criterion for the considered pathology. Then, the multi-criteria assessment is returned back at the patient side and properly combined by using the Theory of Evidence, in order to obtain a single diagnosis concerning the kind of pathology affecting the patient. We have used prospect theory to assess the consensus degree of a decision maker with the majority and to adjust its weight when participating in future collaborative decision making. Finally, we have used Linguistic Fuzzy Set to model the qualitative assessment of human experts and to combine them with the quantitative measures of automated applications for diagnosis analysis.
