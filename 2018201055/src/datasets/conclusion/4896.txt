One challenging problem in image set based classification is that the poses or the viewpoints of the query set are not covered by the corresponding training image set. To solve this issue, in this paper, we proposed to synthesize multiple virtual instances so as to enrich the variety of the dataset. With this simple technique, the recognition rate of image set based face recognition can be enhanced. With respect to the classification scheme, we resort to reverse training. The proposed approach is named as Synthetic Examples based Reverse Training, SERT for short. SERT was evaluated on three benchmark image set datasets designed for video-based face recognition applications and the experimental results indicate that it can yield better performance than the other competitors.
