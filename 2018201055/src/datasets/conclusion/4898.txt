The sequential system using dataset decomposition strategy has been developed initially for standard shepp-logan phantom image reconstruction. This strategy led to long training time. In order to reduce the training time, the parallel approach has been devised. It showed better images than FBP in terms of noisy projections data and ‘limited-angle’ projections data and, better performance than sequential PSO-ANN in terms of computational complexity. The parallel system has been tested with ‘noise-free’ and ‘noise-added’ projection data. The system is also tested with ‘limited-angle’ projections data. In all the parallel with data decomposition cases, less training time is reported. The results presented in this paper clearly show that the parallel approach is feasible for reconstruction of acquired data from any standard medical imaging modality.
