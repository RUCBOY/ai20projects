The dangers of deceptive communications have grown over the past several years as more individuals have crossed the digital divide to participate in a wide range of online activities, from transactional electronic commerce to digital government and a wide range of computer-mediated social interactions. In this milieu, the critical role of trusted online communication requires that we understand the cognitive factors involved in detecting deception. This study can inform the future construction of gender deception research models, including computational deception learning systems. Through these efforts, we hope to establish the basis for a practical understanding of the multifactorial aspects of gender deception in online communication.
