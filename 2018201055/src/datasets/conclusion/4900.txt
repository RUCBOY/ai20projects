The bandwidth reservation service provided by HPNs has proved to be a promising solution for big data transfer. In HPNs, node and link failures are inevitable, and such failures potentially degrade the quality of data transfer. We formulated two generic types of BRRs concerning data transfer reliability, i.e. MaxR-DC and MinT-RC, and proposed optimal algorithms, i.e. Opt-MaxR-DC and Opt-MinT-RC, for a batch of BRRs with rigorous optimality proofs. For each BRR in the batch, the proposed Opt-MaxR-DC/Opt-MinT-RC algorithm returns the reservation option with the largest data transfer reliability (QRHR) or the earliest data transfer completion time (QRECT) under the deadline or reliability constraint.
We compared our algorithms with the algorithm currently being used in OSCARS, OSCARS-MaxR-DC, and its slightly modified version, OSCARS-MinT-RC. To mimic the real network scenario, we conducted extensive simulations on simulated ESnet topology, which is constructed using the real ESnet data. The experimental results show that Opt-MaxR-DC and Opt-MinT-RC have much better overall scheduling performance than OSCARS-MaxR-DC and OSCARS-MinT-RC, respectively. These proposed algorithms have a great potential to improve the data transfer performance from the perspective of application users and the network resource utilization from the perspective of the data transfer service provider in real-life HPNs.
We plan to investigate the reliability issues in heterogeneous networks where nodes and links feature different failure model parameters. It is also of our interest to integrate these proposed algorithms into OSCARS of ESnet to benefit a wide range of network-intensive scientific applications.
