The main purpose of this study was to find a non-invasive measuring technology for measuring human skin temperature, which can be used as feedback signal for control HVAC systems. The conclusions were drawn as follows.
(1)Eulerian video magnification technology can be used to accurately analyze skin color saturation;(2)Linear relationship between skin color saturation and skin temperature existed;(3)Personalized ST model (linear regression) can be used to achieve non-invasive measurements of skin temperatures for young East Asia females with high accuracy and complex process. Medians of absolute errors changed from −0.10 °C to 0.06 °C;(4)Partly personalized ST model (T = 96.5 × S + bi) can be used to achieve non-invasive measurements of skin temperatures for young East Asia females with less high accuracy and simple process. Medians of absolute errors changed from −1.32 °C to 0.61 °C.
There are some limitations in this pilot study. The median slope, based on individual slopes from 16 subjects, is not close enough to each slope. Test with larger sample size should be performed to test the feasibility of partly personalized ST model. Method of deriving thermal sensation, based on skin temperature obtained by video magnification, should be explored for realizing HVAC control in practice.
