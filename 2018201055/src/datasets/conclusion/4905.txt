In this paper, a model for worm propagation based on Wi-Fi is developed. We introduce a new state, the quarantined state (Q), which can prohibit the infected nodes from transmitting the worm sources to the Internet. We give the basic reproduction number R0, and then prove the local and global asymptotic stabilities of our model. Our model has only one worm-free equilibrium P0, which is locally and globally stable when R0<1. There is a unique endemic equilibrium P*, which is locally stable when R0>1. The stabilities of the proposed model imply that the worm will disappear in the end. Finally, simulation results show that the tendency of worm propagation is depressive, which means quarantining infected nodes is an effective way to combat the worm propagated via Wiâˆ’Fi networks. We can reduce the losses of our society by increasing the quarantine rate. Our future work will explore more features in the mobile environment to make the simulation results of the worm propagation more accurately. The delay and topology of the mobile network may be taken into consideration in the future.
