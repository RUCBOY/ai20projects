In this paper we presented the BaRRS scheduling approach for deploying scientific workflows on cloud-based VM resources. BaRRS is based on three techniques and a deep workflow analysis. It produces a scheduling configuration that gives an application owner the flexibility to choose different combination of VMs based on execution time and monetary cost tradeoff. These techniques include queue balancing, file reuse, and file reutilization. BaRRs approach takes a special consideration of the workflow feature analysis such as file sizes, task parallelism and task interdependencies. Four scientific workflows are selected as the application benchmark to test BaRRS performance. BaRRS was compared against the state-of-the-art Provenance scheduling approach, experiments proved BaRRSâ€™s superior performance in meeting conflicting requirements.
Experiments analyzed here reveal two important threads for future investigation. First, as the workflow dependency patterns have an important influence on selection of scheduling polices, enhancing our BaRRS scheduler to inherit diverse set of dependency patterns is important. Our first future direction is to address this issue and provide better solutions. Secondly, scheduling overhead time can impact feasibility of scheduling strategies. For that reason, future investigation is required to filter (detect and dismiss) low quality solutions before the scheduler analyzes it; this should significantly reduce the scheduling overhead time.
