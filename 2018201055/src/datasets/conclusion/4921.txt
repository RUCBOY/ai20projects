Analysis of user-generated event data is increasingly important in forensic investigation of digital evidence. However, few methodologies or tools have been developed to date that use statistical techniques, such as likelihood-ratio methods, for analysis of such data. In this paper we have taken a step towards the development of such techniques, focusing on the problem of investigating whether two event streams were generated by the same source or by different sources. We proposed an approach for generating similarity scores between event streams based on segregation and mingling indices, which are borrowed from statistical models of marked point processes. Experimental results, based on analysis of real-world browser event streams from 28 individuals, indicate that the proposed methodology provides a useful starting point for discriminating between same-source and different-source pairs. Potential future directions that can build on these results include development of accurate calibration methods, analysis of sensitivity and robustness of the methodology, characterization of the properties of a broader range scores and indices, and additional experimental validation of the methods using both simulated and real-world data sets.
