The increasing popularity of online social communities raises various privacy concerns. The issue is even more severe in recommender systems of online social communities, where sensitive user content interests are collected by the recommender server in order to make personalized recommendations. In this work, we propose YANA, an efficient user group-based privacy-preserving recommender system for online social communities. YANA can organize users into user groups with diverse content interests, which can protect usersâ€™ private interests from the server and other parties. Inside user groups, efficient secure multi-party computation algorithms are adopted to protect user privacy from group members. Pseudo users are created within each user group, each representing a unique interest that the group members have. The pseudo users communicate with the server on behalf of the real users in each user group, and also receive recommendations from the server. Recommendation scores can be re-calculated locally to provide customized recommendation for individual real users. We have developed a prototype system on both desktop computers and mobile smart phones, and evaluated the system using real-world data collected from an online social community. The experimental results demonstrate that YANA achieves better recommendation quality and is much more efficient compared against state-of-the-art privacy-preserving collaborative filtering solutions, while preserving user interest privacy in online social communities.
