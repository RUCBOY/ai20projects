We were able to achieve education goals as part of an eMammal citizen science project that was focused mainly on scientific objectives. We hypothesize that the informal learning and the changes in shared information we observed was due to the exciting nature of camera trapping; discovering pictures of charismatic, hard-to-see mammals on the camera that one set is a very engaging activity. We join others in advocating the use of citizen science to address conservation problems (Cooper et al., 2007), especially when there is careful planning to achieve goals (Tulloch et al., 2013), and the use of vouchers to verify data quality (Crall et al., 2011). Citizen science can be an effective tool to connect people to the natural world and while simultaneously increasing support for conservation.
