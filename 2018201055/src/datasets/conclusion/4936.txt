In this paper, we propose an automatic image processing pipeline that is able to accurately detect and segment nuclei in breast pathological images. First, sparse reconstruction with K-SVD and Batch-OMP algorithms are employed to enhance the nucleus area and remove background preliminarily. Moreover, the segmentation stage exploits the DCN trained with structural labels to obtain the accurate pixels of the cell nuclei. Finally, morphological operations and some prior knowledge are introduced to improve the segmentation performance and reduce the errors. The proposed algorithm is a general approach that can be adapted to many pathological applications. Both qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared with several states-of-the-arts.
