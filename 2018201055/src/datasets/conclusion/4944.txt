We have presented an edge-preserving image smoothing algorithm. The smoothing problem is formulated as a problem to minimize a convex object function with a constraint that regularizes the edge and texture pixels under a unified framework. Our algorithm is effective to both nature images and structured images and the degree of smoothing can be controlled by a single parameter. This makes our method easy to use in practice. Experimental results have verified the smoothing performance of the proposed method and demonstrated that the method can be used to improve the performance of a wide range of image processing and manipulation tasks. Of course, if the texture and edges of an image are similar in scales, our method can't work very well, however, this is a problem that will be inherently challenging for any existing algorithms.
