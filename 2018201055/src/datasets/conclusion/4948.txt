After more than half a year of experience with Hazel Hen running in full production, we can say, that the system fully met our expectations. According to the needs of our users, we got a balanced system taking the different performance parameters from the processor, the memory, the network (bandwidth and network latency) and I/O into account. Of course, the applications have to exploit the potential of the machine by being sufficiently adapted to the hardware and for several applications this has shown excellent results.
The examples have shown the potential for improved solutions in the engineering and the climate field, where further results can be expected in the coming years. With these examples, we have also demonstrated that there are applications especially in the engineering field which can scale to hundreds of thousands of cores even solving real world engineering problems. Of course, there are much more scientific problems which now can be tackled. In addition, the different disciplines already have problems waiting in their development queues which would require much higher application performance. Whether such a scaling can go as far as an Exa-scale system remains to be seen.
Besides the scientific world, it has been demonstrated, that industry is using the available high end system successfully, too. This holds not only for the large industrial players coming for example from the automotive field, even small and medium sized enterprises are jumping on high-end machines for their advantage.
As it could be seen, HLRS is offering access to the system and the surrounding service as an HPC service to solve real world problems for the scientific and commercial world. Sheer system peak performance does not play a role. It is rather the usability of the high performance computing environment as an integrated tool that is important to solve the key problems of the academic as well as of the economic world.
