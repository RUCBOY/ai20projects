In this paper, a novel fine-grained digital printing system based on machine vision technology is presented which combines the digital textile printing and non-planar fabrics such as embroidery and lace. The approach is capable of printing the ink-design pattern onto non-planar fabrics. This system consists of a linear array CCD camera, an LED, a computer and a digital textile printer. A new processing flow is adopted in this printing system.
To deal with various fabrics, different algorithms are proposed, shape context based one for embroidery with only stitches along shape, random forest model and Gabor features based one for full embroidery and torque distribution based one for lace. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithms obtain great points correspondences and image alignment results. This prototype can also produce well-designed customized fabrics.
Possible future work includes extending these methods for more types of fabrics, improving productivity and updating printing system to automatically run the corresponding algorithm for fabrics without affecting its accuracy.
