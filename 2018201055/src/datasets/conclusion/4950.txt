In this paper we presented a comparison of detectors and descriptors on diverse image distortions and also evaluated them on large scale image search as well as the performance in the fully affine space. The FAST detector had the highest repeatability score compared to the score of other detectors, moreover it had the least detection time cost per point. Regarding the criteria of recall-precision, our experiments showed that the descriptors of SIFT, RIFF, BRISK, and FREAK performed the best as affine invariant descriptors, and the time complexity showed that the binary descriptors provide a very efficient feature description and matching. Regarding the mAP score, the image copy detection experiments showed that RIFF clearly outperformed SIFT on rotation and scale, and affine transformation. BRIEF had the best accuracy in image blur and was among the best in cropping. SIFT had high accuracy under scaling transformations but performed below average under cropping, content-noise and when rotation and scale were combined.
For the special case of finding correspondences, we proposed the K-order NNDR match strategy for the correspondences matching in the fully affine space framework, and the experimental results show that the K-order NNDR is effective and obtained high accuracy correspondences under challenging image transformations. Furthermore, when taking into account the computational complexity and memory requirement, binary string features with K-order NNDR offers a good trade-off between the accuracy and efficiency.
