We have outlined the requirements of design protocol analysis tools, emphasizing the need for building custom timeline views so that the analyst can set up their own visual representations of design activity. We then presented VizScribe, a visual analytics-based framework for representing and exploring design protocols. Our framework bridges a gap that is currently not addressed by existing qualitative data analysis tools, namely, the processing and presentation of new and emerging forms of data such as sensor data and user log data. VizScribe imports video, transcript, and other log data, and uses linked and interactive representations for the user to navigate and explore, code, and export the data. We refined and enhanced visualizations and interaction modes of the framework by conducting formative studies. We then performed a summative evaluation of VizScribe, through which we showed the advantages of (a) filtered navigation, in helping identify context-specific patterns in the multimodal data visualizations, (b) multiple ways for analysts to approach the same dataset, and (c) supporting the identification of verbal and non-verbal relations within datasets. Finally, we found that the transcript, timeline, and sketch views were versatile visualizations, with custom views bringing newer ways of navigating the dataset and obtaining newer insights.
