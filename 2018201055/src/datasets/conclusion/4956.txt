Although technological progress in recent years has negatively affected employment to a greater degree than ever before, the two-state and three-state Markov chain models employed in this study demonstrate that various external factors derive the rate of computerization, and these factors can be manipulated to help mitigate the negative effects of unregulated technological progress. More specifically, the restriction of the crossover rates, a and b defined in this paper, results in a lower final ratio of being occupations susceptible to computerization, indicating that government intervention and policy changes could help to reduce the impact of technological advancement. Furthermore, the second model, which took into account the creation of new technical jobs, demonstrated that an appreciable proportion of total future employment will consist of new occupations that will provide employment opportunities for humans.
Social programs and expanded education improved living standards in Europe and the United States following decades of economic strife and inequality during the Industrial Revolution. In the same way, revamped education and government-led initiatives could prove to be crucial in helping the present generation of workers transition into a computer- and machine-driven economy. Thus, this study corroborates the initial hypothesis that intervention represents the best way forward in the present employment crisis.
