In this work, a robust and diffeomorphic landmark-constrained surface registration method is proposed based on OMT-Map and T-Map. The algorithms for computation of OMT-Map based area preserving mapping, T-Map and landmark-based surface registration framework are presented with details. Experimental evaluations are performed on real surface data, which show that our registration method is robust, accurate and diffeomorphic. Current work focuses on simply connected surfaces. In the future, we will generalize the framework to surfaces with more general topology.
