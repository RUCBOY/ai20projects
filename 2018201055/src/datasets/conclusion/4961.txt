The blanket criminalisation of all forms of hacktivism fails to appreciate the nature of the digital information age in which we now find ourselves. The value of electronic media and the impact it can have on politics in Uganda was displayed in the 2016 elections when the government shut down all major social media sites including WhatsApp and Facebook.154 It is worth noting that a mass form of hacktivism in the form of the use of VPN (Virtual Private Networks) to bypass the blocking of the Social Networking Sites took place on a grand scale.155 Political and social discourse is increasingly taking place through electronic media and a number of social media campaigns have been used successfully to do crowd funding for various causes,156 secure the release of those arrested without just cause157 and to demand the retraction of careless utterances by public figures.158 One presidential candidate in the recent 2016 elections even declared his intention to stand in a YouTube video.159
In light of this, it is inevitable that protests will continue to shift from the streets and into cyberspace and therefore some form of protection will eventually have to be extended to certain less harmful forms of hacktivism. As a mode of voicing dissent, hacktivism is low risk, easy and inexpensive yet inflicts considerable harm on the target.160 The less harmful forms of hacktivism could receive some form of constitutional protection. A cyber-attack that generates pop-up windows “adjacent” to the targeted website could be allowed legal recognition as a form of legitimate protest. Although it would still fall foul of the provisions of the CMA against unauthorised access and modification, it could be allowed constitutional protection as a legitimate protest because it does not offend against the legal interest protected by the country's cyber laws.161 The pop up would in effect be a ‘cyber sidewalk’ which could count as a public forum where protest can be permitted. An example of such hacktivism in Uganda was the use of a pop up window by Hackers Uganda when they hacked into the Uganda Investment Authority website in 2011.162 Pop up windows are not censorial in nature, as they do not take down the target's website.163 A pop up that displays obscene materials would nonetheless be illegal as pornography.164 Until some such protection is achieved, hacktivism in Uganda remains illegal under the CMA with no constitutional protection.
