A new graph matching relaxation model, called LRGM, has been proposed to solve IQP matching problem. The main benefit of LRGM is that it incorporates both affine mapping and discrete constraint simultaneously and returns a desirable (approximate) discrete solution for IQP matching problem. Thus, it can avoid post-discretization step required in many other relaxation methods. An effective multiplicative update algorithm has been developed to solve the proposed LRGM model. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed. Also, the converged solution is guaranteed to be KKT optimality. Experimental results on several matching tasks show the better performance of the proposed LRGM method.
