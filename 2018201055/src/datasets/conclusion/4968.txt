Online gambling is a continuously expanding practice, and accordingly a greater understanding of online gambling needs to be gained. Previous findings are partially divergent on this subject, for example concerning how online gambling relates to demographic factors, gambling problems and substance use. This study builds upon this body of research by comparing the associations of online gambling and land-based gambling for males and females separately using a nationally representative sample.
Results show that in general online gamblers were younger than land-based gamblers among both genders. Nonetheless, online gambling is not limited to young adults, as it is encountered among individuals in their 50's, even more so than among 18 to 24 year olds. For both genders results indicate that online gamblers are typically experienced with computer gaming, and likewise that online gamblers engage in a higher number of gambling types than land-based gamblers. Risky alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking were not associated to gambling mode when controlling for other factors. Importantly, particularly for females online gambling may be related to higher relative expenditure and at-risk and problem gambling, providing implications for tailored interventions. In line with previous studies, it seems that the harmfulness of the internet as a mode of gambling is particularly related to the accompanied increased amount of gambling. The continued study of subgroups of gamblers is necessary to comprehensively understand the altering gambling milieu.
