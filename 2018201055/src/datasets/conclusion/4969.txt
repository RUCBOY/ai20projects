The positive association between teachers' online curricular demonstration video viewing and their FOI suggests demonstration videos are a viable fidelity support resource worthy of further investigation. Although evidence-based curricular programs are linked to improved student outcomes (Pianta etÂ al., 2009), these curricula need to be implemented with fidelity. Identifying types of effective curricular resources for teachers is one step toward increasing FOI. However, it is not only critical to create those resources but also to encourage and support teachers' use of independently-driven PD activities.
