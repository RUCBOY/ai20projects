In this paper, extensive research was presented concerning optimal sample preparation and digitization technique selection as well as algorithm development for digital image processing, analysis and feature extraction for fold cracking resistance assessment. The findings were as follows:
•The values of WPP show increasing tendency by increasing the basis weight of the paper samples for most of the examined parameters, but only for two digitizing techniques (scanning and capturing via digital camera).•By microscopic analysis and image capturing at magnification of 50×, the large-scale print non-uniformity (mottling) was emphasized which has led to the significantly higher WPP values than the other two digitization methods, regardless of the paper grade, folding direction or inner angle of sample placement.•The scanning process was the most time-consuming digitizing method on the spot (especially with the highest resolution), but the derived input images were uniformly sharp with good contrast which contributed to a homogenous set of WPP results.•The digital camera also obtained a coherent set of WPP values, however, the occasionally inadequate sharpness and initial contrast on the gained images caused higher WPP values than the scanned images.•Although the inner angle of 180° was the simplest sample placement position (additional sample holder is not required), the gained images did not reflect truthfully the occurred surface defects and cracks.•The results of correlation analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between the proposed feature (WPP) and referent measurement (RTS) for most of the examined variable parameters. These results, in general, suggest that the developed algorithm fulfils the defined requirements and the proposed feature of digitized samples faithfully describes the analyzed surface damages.
Although none of the sample preparation and digitization parameters showed superior performances at all points and therefore cannot be proposed the best parameter set for implementation, the presented image processing based quality control is promising. With modification and fine-tuning of digital camera setup, it has a potential for automatic fold-crack detection and in-line quality assessment, while the scanner-based digitization is already suitable for laboratory assessment.
