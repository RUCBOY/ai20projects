The paper presented the gamification of Apollo lunar exploration missions and the evaluation of using the game to promote STEM learning. We described the design and development of the game based on the missions the astronauts executed in 1960s and 1970s. The technical solutions for generating the high quality lunar terrain and real-time rendering complex geometric models were also addressed. The usability study was done by a multidisciplinary group of participants, who suggested a number of positive comments and improvements for future development.
In the future, we will gamify more Apollo missions. We are currently working on the gamification of Apollo 17 mission. We would like users to learn about the evolution of the sequence of Apollo missions, which would be important to the history of space technology. We would like to improve the game according to the comments we received. We plan to add cut scenes or video clips to show the actions of astronauts collecting soil samples or setting up science experiments. More rock obstacles will be added to make the driving more challenging. We plan to modify the game for elementary and middle school students by creating child-friendly controls and interfaces (e.g., replacing text-based instructions with graphical tutorials). We also plan to perform a quantitative assessment to identify the relationship among the number of times of play, the improvement of play score, and learning efficiency.
