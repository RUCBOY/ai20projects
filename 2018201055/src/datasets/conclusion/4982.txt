In this work, an efficient hardware implementation of an AKS is proposed, the aim being to improve the performance of the system by exploiting the parallelism inherent to ANNs. For the first time, an architectural model for the SoC-AKS was successfully implemented on a platform, which allows parallel execution, portability, low power consumption, miniaturization, and reduced computation time vs. software-based classifiers running on PCs.
Promising results were obtained regarding the classification subsystem based on the Kohonen neural networks. Implemented on an ML501-Virtex5 FPGA platform, the realized part of the SoC-AKS uses about 14% of resources with a quite low power consumption of 0.549â€¯W, compared to that of a software-based system running on a PC, which consumes hundreds of watts.
The recognition rate of our architecture is of 65.5%, an acceptable value similar to that obtained with software implementations. The proposed SoC-AKS architecture presents the framework for a portable AKS realization that facilitates the task for possible improvements of this work. As future work, we aim to extend the realized part of the proposed system by integrating the other parts of the SoC-AKS, including image acquisition, image processing and feature extraction subsystems, with the aim to build a portable AKS.
