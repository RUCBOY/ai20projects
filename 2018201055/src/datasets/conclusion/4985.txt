As shown in the former section, weighting the order (thermodynamical disequilibrium) and disorder (thermodynamical equilibrium) to calculate LMC and SDL complexity measures, provides the adaptation of the mathematical expressions to the explanation of the onset of complex behaviors in natural phenomena.
Concerning to the probability dependence of SDL complexity measure while changing the weights of the order and disorder terms, Fig. 5a confirms the symmetry related to the equiprobable case and how the shape of the curve changes, summarizing the conclusions for this measure.Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 5. SDL and LMC complexity measures depending on p and α (N = 10): (a) SDL and (b) LMC.
For the probability dependence of LMC complexity measure while changing the weights of the order and disorder terms, Fig. 5b confirms the symmetry related to the equiprobable case and how the shape of the curve changes, summarizing the conclusions for this measure.
Finally, Fig. 5a and b expresses in a compact view that, qualitatively, LMC and SDL complexity measures are equivalent, even changing the weights.
