The optical image multiplexing and authentication method based on the DPRA is proposed in this study. The parametric characteristics of wavelength and position in the FrT are utilized to achieve the image multiplexing and authentication. Compared with the previous studies which also based on the double-POF architecture, the number of required parameters in the FrT and the reconstructed image quality are similar. However, the proposed method provides higher security because only the noise-like image can be decrypted when any of the keys is wrong during the reconstruction process. In our future work, more analysis of the parameter sensitivity on system performance and security level will be investigated. If the alignment issue of the two POMs and other optical devices can be solved, the optical experiments will be conducted as well. The number of POMs can be more than two in the proposed system if the higher security is desired.
