A physical-based drain current compact model for a-InGaZnO TFTs considering both the tail and deep trap states is proposed. The explicit calculation of the surface potential exactly predicts the numerical results. The drain current model can accurately reproduce the measurements of a-InGaZnO TFTs. In addition, the effects on the DC characteristics from the parameters in the model are discussed in detail. The explicit and simple formulations of the surface potential and drain current can be utilized in CAD applications.
