Modeling of computer worms is crucial for understanding the dynamic impact of computer worm attacks. Specifically, mathematical models of worm infections help us deeply understand the infection mechanisms that determine the size and speed of damage. The models help us to not only understand the mechanisms of computer worms but also evaluate the effectiveness of defense mechanisms and provide early warning about worms’ potential damage.
The worms are classified as scan based or topology based on the basis of infection mechanisms [1], [2], [3]. The scan-based worms propagate by probing the entire Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) space or a set of IP addresses and directly compromise vulnerable target nodes without a human interface [2]. The topology-based worms, such as worms via e-mail and social networking sites (SNS), rely on the information contained in the victim device to locate new targets and spread through topological neighbors [1], [2], [3]. They spread only when infected users accept invitations, install malicious applications, check newly received messages, and open malicious links [2]. They try to infect vulnerable nodes in an address book or “friends” list of an infected user. For example, as soon as a user opens an attachment of an e-mail worm such as Aliz [4] and Sircam [5], the e-mail worm sends out worm e-mail copies to all e-mail addresses in the user’s e-mail address book. When a user is infected by an SNS worm such as Koobface [6], the user’s account automatically sends a malicious file to “friends” of the infected user or directs them to a third-party website to download a malicious file to infect other accounts.
Topology-based worms have long been threats. Topology-based worms by e-mail such as Aliz [4] and Sircam [5] appeared in 2001 and are now old-fashioned. The viruses or worms spreading by SNS messengers such as Facebook Messenger use the same mechanism as topology-based worms spreading by e-mail, so they are classified as the topology-based worms. Viruses have been spreading by Facebook Messenger since 2013 [7]. Danes [7] reports that Facebook Messenger viruses increased in activity in August and October, 2017, April and December, 2018, June, 2019, and July, 2020. Facebook Messenger viruses send malicious spam messages to everybody in the victim’s Facebook “friends” list. This spreading mechanism seems likely to continue to be used in the future because the recipients tend to trust the message and be infected easily.
Mathematical techniques developed to study epidemic infectious diseases have been used to study computer worm propagation. Mathematical models for the scan-based worms assume that each infectious node has an equal probability of spreading the worm to any vulnerable peer in a network, which is called a homogeneous assumption [2]. The models are successful when using differential or difference equations based on existing biological epidemic models [2] and well match infections of actual scan-based worms [8], [9], [10], [11].
Although mathematical models have been successfully made for scan-based worms, they are difficult to make for topology-based worms because such models must not have the homogeneous assumption. In fact, no topology-based models introduced in the survey paper [2] are expressed by differential or difference equations. Some are expressed by simulation models [12], [13] and others by Markov models [14]. The mathematical model for the scan-based worms cannot be used for topology-based worms because it overestimates the infection speed of an epidemic in a topological network [12]. This overestimation cannot be ignored because a worm’s infection speed is largely determined by its initial spreading speed [8]. Therefore, a mathematical model for topology-based worms is required.
Discrete models for topology-based worms are preferable to continuous models because IP addresses or logical neighbors are usually scanned in discrete time [15]. Wang et al. [2] state:
The propagation of worms is a discrete event process. A continuous-time model can possibly result in a different spreading speed and infected scale because a host begins devoting itself to infecting other hosts even though only a “small part” of it is infected. Consequently, modeling worm propagation at each discrete time tick is more accurate than using continuous time.
In this paper, we reclassify the infection mechanisms of computer worms from a new point of view (whether the infection is permanent or temporary) because mathematical models are difficult to make on the basis of the current point of view. The new point of view enables us to make mathematical models on the basis of whether an infection is permanent or temporary without considering the degree of infectiousness of each node even though the classification result from the new point of view is the same as that from the conventional one. Worms that infect vulnerable nodes by scanning are regarded as permanently infectious, and permanently infectious nodes continuously try to infect other nodes. Worms that infect vulnerable nodes by spreading through topological neighbors such as via e-mail or SNS messengers are regarded as temporarily infectious, and temporarily infectious nodes try to infect all other nodes in an address book or “friends” list soon after being infected and then stop attempting to infect other nodes. This is because worms via e-mail try to infect other nodes in the address book of the infected node, and nodes in address books do not change regularly. Such worms stop trying to infect the nodes after attacking once.
On the basis of this reclassification of infection mechanisms, this paper also proposes a simple discrete model as the temporary infection model and a continuous model with an assumption of infinite nodes. The continuous model is described with a Riccati equation. The proposed discrete model is also equivalent to a discrete susceptible–infected–recovered (SIR) model [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] for the spread of biological virus infections with a constant infectious period because quarantining all infected persons after a certain period can be equivalent to a temporary infection. Also, this paper proposes another discrete temporary infection model and discrete SIR model that both have exact solutions. These models enable us to analyze infections without the continuous-time model because they have exact solutions and to simulate the effect of a countermeasure easier than the continuous model.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explains the conventional classification of infection mechanisms of computer worms: scan-based and topology-based models [2]. Then we reclassify them as permanent and temporary infection models. Section 3 presents a logistic equation as a mathematical model for a permanent infection model. Section 4 proposes a temporary infection model with a simple difference equation and obtains a Riccati (differential) equation as a limit of infinite vulnerable nodes. Also, we propose a difference model that assumes finite vulnerable nodes and has an exact solution. In Section 5, the temporary infection model is verified with actual data. Section 6 shows that the temporary infection model overcomes the overestimation. In Section 7, the difference equation that has an exact solution is used to obtain a condition in which all nodes are infected when vulnerable nodes are finite. Section 8 demonstrates that the proposed model can be rewritten as an SIR model with a constant infectious period and presents a control with the proposed model. Finally, Section 9 concludes the paper with a summary.
