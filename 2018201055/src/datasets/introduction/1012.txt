Abramson and Parashar (A&P) argue in a recent article [1] for the formalization of translational computer science (TCS) as a complement to traditional modes of computer science research. Translation as a concept emerged in medicine in the 1990s [2]. Observing a growing number of biomedical research discoveries that had not been exploited to improve clinical outcomes [3], biomedical researchers argued for new research approaches in which the application of research results is an explicit part of the research plan—that indeed, have the goal of translating research results into “new approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of disease” [4]. Translational medicine has since become a major part of the biomedical research enterprise. A&P argue that in computer science also, the scale of technological disruptions and the increasing centrality of computing and data in society, “[make] it desirable that we closely couple cycles of innovation between computer science and other disciplines, with the potential to significantly accelerate the transformative impact of computer science”. A&P discuss how effective translation requires a thoughtful and deliberate staging of technologies from the laboratory to the locale—TCS analogs of translational medicine’s bench and bedside.
In this article, we revisit, from the perspective of translational computer science, our work from the mid-1990s onwards in grid computing. We first summarize the problems that we sought to solve and the approach that we took to solving those problems. Then we examine the work from a TCS perspective, noting characteristics that correlated with success in grid computing projects, and discussing issues such as publication, student engagement, and sustainability. We conclude with some personal reflections on translational computer science.
