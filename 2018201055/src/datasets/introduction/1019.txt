The computer based control equipments were provided testing and compare the data with high accuracy and speed. The computer control and its applications have been increased in quality and inspection. The different tests were performed with the aid of computer control such as load test, stress, strain and tensile test. In recent days, the computerized control was used in hydraulic, pneumatic and mechanical systems. The computer control and automated testing were processed in welding. The visualization and data acquisition was also included [1]. The control system and digital image correlation method were used to cyclic/fatigue tests of polymer materials [2]. The computer measurement and control system was applied in tensile testing machine to measure substance properties [3]. Digital control system and design information was used for material testing [4]. The digital correlation method was used to determine the deformation and displacement [5]. The advanced system of measurement and testing has been provided for high accuracy [6], [7]. X-ray computer control based tomography systems have been used for material testing and inspection [8]. The software based image processing techniques and computer modeling of inspections were used to energy related process [9], [10], [11]. The computed tomography was used to test the polymeric materials [12]. The ultrasonic CT system was applied to investigate the weld metal [13]. Ultrasonic tomography was used to test the material quality and concrete reinforcement [14], [15]. X-ray computed tomography was played an important role in metrology [16]. An integrated CAD and computer-aided inspection planning have been studied [17], [18]. An importance of testing and their developments were used in many industries to improve the processes [19]. Planning, verification and validation were the different phases of testing process [20]. This paper was describes the computer aided testing of materials through interfacing device.
