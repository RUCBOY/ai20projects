Corpus-based lists of academic expressions constitute highly valuable resources for teachers and learners of English for Academic Purposes (EAP) (e.g., Ackermann & Chen, 2013; Biber, Conrad, & Cortes, 2004; Durrant, 2009; Morley, 2015; Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010). The pedagogical value of such lists depends first and foremost on the quality of the items they include, which is directly affected by the methodological rigor of the research efforts that generate them. As such, well-received corpus-based lists of academic expressions, such as the Academic Formulas List (Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010) and the Academic Collocations List (Ackermann & Chen, 2013), all resulted from the application of a rigorous combination of quantitative and qualitative criteria for identifying and filtering candidate expressions on carefully constructed corpora of academic texts.
Meanwhile, the pedagogical usefulness of corpus-based lists is also affected by the types and range of information provided for the expressions included therein. For this reason, many lists of academic expressions integrate information on the structural and functional categorizations of the expressions they include (e.g., Durrant, 2009; Lu, Yoon, & Kisselev, 2018; Mizumoto, Hamatani, & Imao, 2017; Omidian, Shahriari, & Siyanova-Chanturia, 2018; Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010). Many research efforts in categorizing academic expressions utilize some variation or adaptation of the taxonomy originally developed by Biber et al. (2004). This taxonomy grouped lexical bundles into three major structural categories: namely, bundles that incorporate fragments of verb phrases, dependent clauses, and noun or prepositional phrases, as well as three main functional categories: namely, stance expressions, discourse organizers, and reference bundles. Categorizing academic expressions in terms of such broad discourse functions is pedagogically useful, as it helps promote learner awareness of the shared linguistic properties among the expressions. Nevertheless, it does not get to the core of how academic writers use such expressions to realize specific communicative functions, for example, to indicate a research gap.
An alternative approach to grouping academic expressions by function has been recently suggested by Durrant and Mathews-Aydınlı (2011) and Cortes (2013). This approach first determines the rhetorical functions of the text chunks containing the formulaic expressions extracted from the corpus and then categorizes those formulaic expressions in terms of the rhetorical functions they are used to realize. This approach has much promise for helping EAP learners successfully deploy formulaic expressions in appropriate contexts and for appropriate communicative purposes. Despite the potential value of this approach, however, studies that adopt this approach are relatively few, largely due to the labor-intensiveness of coding large corpora for rhetorical functions.
The current study seeks to contribute to the burgeoning research interest in correlating formulaic expressions and rhetorical functions by systematically examining the rhetorical functions of a particular type of formulaic language, that is, phrase-frames (Fletcher, 2011, hereafter p-frames), in a large corpus of social science research article (RA) introductions. A p-frame can be defined as a semi-fixed multi-word expression with an open slot that can be filled by different (but often semantically coherent) words (Fletcher, 2011). For example, in the p-frame the ∗ of the study, the open slot can be filled by aim, objective, goal, purpose and the like. We describe the approach we took to annotate the corpus for rhetorical move-steps, report the results of our analysis of the distribution of the p-frames identified from the corpus across different rhetorical move-steps, and discuss the pedagogical implications of the resulting list of p-frames aligned with rhetorical move-steps and the findings of our analysis.
1.1. Corpus-based lists of academic formulaic expressionsFormulaic expressions are generally understood to be sequences of words or other linguistic units, either continuous or discontinuous, that co-occur significantly more frequently than predicted by the respective frequencies of the component words or units (Sinclair, 1991) and that appear to be stored and processed as a whole (Hunston, 2002; Sinclair, 1991; Wray, 2008). Formulaic expressions have been found to play a fundamental role in both first and second language acquisition and processing (e.g., Conklin & Schmitt, 2012; Ellis, 2012; Eskildsen, 2009; Gries & Wulff, 2005; Lieven & Tomasello, 2008). They have also been recognized to be important in second language pedagogy, particularly for promoting fluency and idiomaticity in learner language production (e.g., Hyland, 2012; Nesselhauf, 2005; Paquot & Granger, 2012).Corpus linguists have shown that formulaic expressions are omnipresent in academic texts (e.g., Biber et al., 2004; Hyland, 2007; Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010), and EAP scholars have argued for the importance of integrating the analysis of formulaic expressions and their functions in EAP writing pedagogy (e.g., Coxhead & Byrd, 2007; Paltridge, 2004). These insights have prompted extensive research efforts in compiling pedagogically useful corpus-based lists of academic formulaic expressions using large-scale, representative corpora of academic texts and a combination of quantitative and qualitative criteria for extracting and filtering candidate items for inclusion. Most such lists include in their repository either collocations, such as the Academic Collocations List (Ackermann & Chen, 2013) and the Academic English Collocation List (Lei & Liu, 2016), or continuous multi-word expressions, such as the Academic Formulas List (Simpson-Vlach & Ellis, 2010).Meanwhile, some researchers noted that discontinuous multi-word expressions such as p-frames are also important to acquire and should become an integral part of pedagogically oriented lists of academic formulaic expressions (e.g., Cunningham, 2017; Durrant, 2009; Lu et al., 2018; Römer, 2010). Some overlap exists between p-frames and collocations and continuous multi-word expressions. For example, a specific variant of a p-frame (e.g., the goal of the paper for the p-frame the ∗ of the paper) is effectively a continuous multi-word expression. However, p-frames provide useful information about discontinuous patterns and their variability. It has been reported that, compared to conversational discourse, academic discourse not only relies more heavily on discontinuous formulaic expressions but also allows for greater variability of such expressions (Biber, 2009; Gray & Biber, 2013). Furthermore, an emerging body of research has shown the importance and usefulness to identify larger patterns and constructions (e.g., N1 of N2, where N1 and N2 denote two nouns or noun phrases, as in the concept of genre) at an even lower level of lexicalization and higher level of generality than discontinuous frames in academic discourse (e.g., Hunston & Su, 2019; Liu & Lu, 2020). Overall, these developments suggest that EAP writers will benefit not only from lists of academic collocations and continuous formulaic expressions, but also from those of discontinuous lexical frames and larger constructions and patterns.
1.2. Functional categorizations of formulaic expressions in corpus-based listsAs briefly mentioned above, many corpus-based lists of academic formulaic expressions present information on the structural and/or functional categories of their items in an effort to enhance their pedagogical usefulness. In terms of functional categorization, the taxonomy developed by Biber et al. (2004), which distinguishes three broad functions for lexical bundles—stance expressions, reference bundles, and discourse organizers—along with some subcategories for each major category, has been widely used, often with adaptation. For example, Hyland (2008) categorized lexical bundles in academic discourse into research-oriented, text-oriented, and participant-oriented bundles, and Simpson-Vlach and Ellis (2010) categorized academic formulas into stance, discourse, and referential expressions, both with multiple subcategories for each major category. In a similar vein, Lu et al. (2018) categorized the p-frames extracted for their analysis functionally into stance, referential, and discourse-organizing frames along with some further sub-categories.While functional categorization done in this fashion substantially enhances the usefulness of corpus-based lists for EAP teachers and learners, the limitations of taxonomies with such broad functional categories have also been recognized. Simpson-Vlach and Ellis (2010) noted that such taxonomies drive a “proliferation” of sub-categories that “make it difficult to distill the data into a compact functional model applicable across corpora and domains of use” (p. 502). Indeed, although the main categories used in the studies mentioned above all had three major categories only, the number and types of subcategories for each category varied substantially across those studies. More importantly, such broad functional categories fall short of directly helping learners see how communicative functions characteristic of different genres of academic writing are realized linguistically.To address these limitations, recent scholarship has started to combine the strengths of corpus analysis and genre analysis to analyze the use of formulaic expressions in terms of the rhetorical functions they serve in academic writing (e.g., Cortes, 2013; Durrant & Mathews-Aydınlı, 2011; Le & Harrington, 2015; Omidian et al., 2018). Cortes (2013) examined the use of lexical bundles in a corpus of 1,300 published research article introductions from 13 disciplines and found that many of them correlated with the realization of specific rhetorical move-steps. Le and Harrington (2015) identified word clusters from the Discussion sections of 124 research articles and mapped them onto specific rhetorical steps in the “Commenting on results” move. Omidian et al. (2018) classified frequently occurring multi-word expressions in a corpus of 5,910 conference abstracts across six disciplines according to their communicative functions in different rhetorical moves and reported “different priorities for representing” (p. 1) research across disciplines. These studies all adopted what Durrant and Mathews-Aydınlı (2011) called a “form-first approach” (p. 58), identifying formulaic expressions first and then annotating their rhetorical functions based on their “surrounding context” (Omidian et al., 2018, p. 5) or “the extended co-text of each individual concordance line” (Le & Harrington, 2015, p. 49).While the form-first approach allows researchers to relatively efficiently explore the relationship between linguistic forms and rhetorical functions, it is also subject to two important validity and reliability concerns. First, in this approach, functional interpretation is generally based on an existing framework and proceeds in a top-down fashion, making it difficult to account for new functions that may emerge in the corpus being analyzed (e.g., Moreno & Swales, 2018). Second, and more importantly, in some cases accurate functional interpretation may require the analysis of a much larger context than the context immediately surrounding the linguistic form in question. Durrant and Mathews-Aydınlı (2011) adopted a “function-first approach” in their analysis of formulaic expressions used to realize a specific function, that of “indicating the structure,” in the introduction sections of 94 student essays, starting with a full annotation of the rhetorical moves and steps of their data. This allowed them to avoid the potential problems of the form-first approach, although their dataset was relatively small in scale, and their analysis focused on a single rhetorical move only. Liu and Lu (2020) used the same approach to examine the rhetorical functions of N1 of N2 constructions in a corpus of applied linguistics research article introductions. No prior study has systematically examined the connections of p-frames to rhetorical functions in academic writing, and we argue that an investigation of these connections from a function-first approach will yield resources and findings with highly useful implications for EAP pedagogy.
1.3. The current studyThe current study adopts the function-first approach to systematically match p-frames identified from a large corpus of social science RA introductions to the rhetorical move-steps they are used to signal or otherwise help realize. We present the actual list of functionally categorized p-frames as a pedagogical resource, and report results on the distribution of p-frames across different rhetorical move-steps and on the types of p-frames that emerge from our analysis with respect to whether they have specialized associations with specific move-steps.As discussed earlier, formulaic expressions have been captured using units at different structural levels and different levels of lexicalization or generality, and these different perspectives have yielded repertoires of academic formulaic expressions with complementary pedagogical benefits to EAP learners (e.g., collocations, lexical bundles, p-frames, and larger constructions and patterns). Meanwhile, they also each have their own limitations. Our focus on p-frames in the current study highlights the pedagogical value of this type of units but does not in any way suggest that it is problem free or that other types of units should be overlooked.Previous research has revealed substantial variation in formulaic language use among different registers, genres, part-genres, and disciplines (e.g., Biber et al., 2004; Durrant, 2017; Hyland, 2008). Our focus on RA introductions is motivated both by this insight and by the existence of a mature body of research on the rhetorical move-step structure of this specific part-genre (e.g., Swales, 1990, 2004). In terms of discipline specificity, the study's focus on the area of social sciences constitutes a middle ground between discipline-general and discipline-specific research, and we leave the systematic examination of interdisciplinary variation in the mappings between p-frames and rhetorical move-steps in RA introductions to a future study.
Symbols & markup
∗ the variant slot
Note: Each p-frame entry contains the variant(s) associated with the corresponding rhetorical move-step only; as such, some entries may contain only one variant. While each p-frame was required to meet specific frequency and range thresholds, the p-frame variants did not have to meet any such requirement. Consequently, some p-frame variants may have occurred in only one research article introduction and may thus appear fairly specialized. Numerals in variant slots were replaced by #. Some frame-final variants are followed by a list of words or expressions in parentheses to indicate that they were frequently followed by thoses words or expressions in the corpus.
