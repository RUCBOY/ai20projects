Computer simulations (CSs) are involved in numerous branches of modern science, and science would not be the same without them. Yet the following question remains an issue of considerable debate: “(How) can computer simulations [...] explain real-world processes?” (Saam, 2017 295) Assuming that they can somehow help to explain real-world processes, I will focus on the ‘how’ question.
A range of authors (e.g. Morgan, 2002, Morgan, 2003, Morgan, 2005; Parker 2009; Winsberg 2009; Niiniluoto 2013) have drawn attention to our inferences back to the world from CS-result. These concern properties of some target, T, based on our observations of a simulating system, S. While the question of whether CSs can themselves be seen as a kind of inference has been addressed in detail (Beisbart, 2012, Beisbart and Norton, 2012), it is hard to find a detailed characterization of how we infer back to the world.1 
It is doubtful that one characterization is possible across all uses of CSs in science. Hence I will take on two subordinate tasks in this paper: (I) characterize the relation between S and T that allows for inferences in the first place, i.e., their very preconditions, and (II) characterize the inferences in (specific) explanatory contexts, based on (I). Regarding (I), I will defend the view that analogies crucially drive our inferences from S to T, in either of two ways: by a contrived analogy between computer and target, or, alternatively, by defining a fictional system that behaves straightforwardly analogous to T.2 
Subsequently, I will single out a specific kind of context and analyze the inferences we draw therein. I will argue that these follow a particular abductive scheme, thereby connecting CSs to “the inference that makes science” (McMullin, 1992). Therefore, (II) offers a part-wise closure of the gap left by the lack of specification, which may be seen as one step in a larger enterprise.
