With the maturity of technology and science, brain science becomes an important research field for humans to explore the mysteries of life. Brain science focuses on studying the structure and mechanism of the brain, which can be traced back to the 1960s, and has received consistent attention worldwide in the past decades [1]. To analyze the electrical activities of brain, electroencephalogram (EEG) is applied widely in different directions of brain science.
EEG signals can be measured by placing electrodes on the surface of the scalp and collected by brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, which are generated through the cortical nerve cell inhibitory and excitatory postsynaptic potentials [2]. BCI is a direct communication and control channel established between the human brain and computers or other electronic devices [3]. Fig. 1 summarizes the applications of EEG signals for human-computer interaction and neurological disease diagnosis. Commonly used EEG signals in BCI studies include P300, visual evoked potential (VEP), steadystate visually evoked potential (SSVEP) and slow cortical potential (SCP), event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS) [4]. EEG provides assistance in two main aspects: human-computer interaction and neurological disease diagnosis. EEG signals help the human-computer interaction systems in speech recognition [5], emotion detection [6], user experience evaluation [7] and rehabilitation [8]. It also serves as a useful tool for doctors and researchers to diagnose diseases associated with brain dysfunction, such as Alzheimer’s disease [9], epilepsy [10], schizophrenia [11], cerebral palsy [12] and mild cognitive impairment [13].Download : Download high-res image (253KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Applications of EEG Signals.
To implement the applications mentioned above, the following characteristics of EEG signals must be considered in EEG signal feature extraction to ensure that the features closely related to the task are extracted. First, the brain signals are complex, which lead to non-stationary, non-linear and non-Gaussian in EEG signals [2]. Second, the characteristics of EEG signals are highly subject to various individual differences such as age and mentality and the EEG signals of different individuals may be different for the same event [14]. Last, EEG signals are highly noisy and susceptible to be distorted by artificial interference. Hence, it is difficult to extract effective information related to specific tasks from EEG signals [15].
According to the characteristics mentioned above, the analysis of EEG signal faces two main difficulties:
1) Individual Difference: In the process of feature extraction and classification, individual difference brings difficulties when the pre-trained model is applied in new tasks directly. Gianotti first demonstrated the neural signatures underlying individual differences in the feeling of being looked at through measuring the width of the cone of direct gaze in 137 healthy participants [16]. Matthews et al. found that there were large differences in five indicators reflecting EEG signal in psychometric measurements through an experiment on 150 patients, who completed psychological stress tests in a complex simulated operating environment [17].2) Insufficient Information: Due to the different types of information in EEG signal and its non-stationary and low signal-to-noise ratio, it is difficult to filtrate the information sensitive to a specific task. Furthermore, the problem of insufficient data arises when applying EEG signals to new fields, especially for the emerging and interdisciplinary fields [18]. Dutta and Nandy reported that the lack of available EEG data sets made it difficult to estimate mental stats with deep learning models [19]. Luo et al. held the view that data deficiency is adverse to emotion recognition with high complexity [20].
In order to solve the above mentioned problems, traditional algorithms in EEG signal analysis are improved, and new methods are also developed by researchers. Generally, there are three main stages in traditional EEG signal analysis: first, the features of original signals are extracted; second, features related to the task are selected and reserved; third, a classifier is built to classify the selected feature set. In feature extraction, other types of features, such as connectivity features and high order statistics are also explored in addition to the traditional frequency band power features and time point features [21], [22]. Moreover, several studies combined different types of features to extract more information [23], [24]. In feature selection, apart from using filter to remove the features that are irrelevant to the task, wrapper and some sorting methods are developed to choose the feature subset [25], [26]. Finally, in feature classification, deep learning, Riemann geometry and other methods are applied to improve the accuracy of classifier from different perspectives [27], [28], [29], [30]. Some algorithms extract and classify the features jointly, such as neural networks and embedded approaches [31], [32]. In most traditional methods, it is generally assumed that the training data and the testing data have the same distribution. However, this assumption usually cannot be established in practical applications. In this case, the expensive cost of model reconstruction and training data recollection obstructs the development of algorithms [33].
Transfer learning solves this problem by adjusting the model via priori knowledge to make it adaptable in new tasks. Apart from this, as a common situation in EEG signal analysis tasks, data scarcity makes model training difficult [34]. Transfer learning model still keeps learning ability without large amount of data based on priori knowledge learnt in related tasks. Transfer learning focuses on applying the knowledge learnt in one domain into a different but related domain, which was first proposed at the 1995 NIPS-95 seminar on ‘Learning to Learn’ [14], [35], [36]. In 2005, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency gave a new definition of transfer learning: the ability of the system to recognize and apply the knowledge and skills learnt in previous tasks to a new task [35]. Unlike traditional machine learning, the focus of transfer learning is on the target task with one or multiple source tasks which are trained to provide priori knowledge for the target task. Transfer learning has been applied in a variety of fields, such as data mining, image recognition, language translation, fault diagnosis and positioning system [37], [38], [39], [40]. The advantages of transfer learning in EEG signal analysis are as follows:
1) Match individual difference: In EEG signal processing tasks, the difference between the training and testing data is huge, such as subjects, sampling time and task objectives [41], which increases the difficulty in analysis as explained before. Transfer learning can make the model flexibly matching different individuals and tasks through adjustments. Researchers started to propose algorithms that are adaptive to different subjects and individuals [42], [43].2) Reduce data requirement: In EEG signal analysis, problems of data scarcity and insufficient labeling hinder the learning of the target task [34], [2]. Transfer learning learns the target task according to priori knowledge learnt in a similar domain by a small amount of data in the target domain to adjust the classifier, which reduces the requirements for available data. Different transfer learning models are proposed to solve the problem of small training trials in various applications [44], [45].
With the persistent study of transfer learning, various transfer learning algorithms were developed in EEG signal analysis, which also obtained satisfactory results in experiments. This paper attempts to provide a brief summary of the literature relating to the applications of transfer learning algorithms in EEG signal analysis so far to the researchers in related fields. This paper generalizes the frequently used algorithms of transfer learning with the practical applications in EEG signal analysis. The challenges and development prospects of transfer learning in EEG signal analysis are also discussed.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the basics of transfer learning are introduced in detail. The transfer learning methods frequently used in EEG signal analysis are illustrated in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the status and development of transfer learning in EEG signal analysis. Finally, conclusion of this review is made in Section 5.
