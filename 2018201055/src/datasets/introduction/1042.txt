With the development of computer vision, the calibration method of computer vision system has been paid more and more attention. Nowadays, system calibration has a very wide range of applications. As a hot field in computer vision, it is widely used in the field of industrial, agricultural, measurement, medical, aerospace etc. Therefore, research on computer vision system calibration method has a broad prospect.
One of the basic tasks of computer vision is to calculate the geometric information of objects in 3d space from the image information obtained by camera. Then, the object is identified according to the geometric information. The relationship between the three-dimensional geometric position of a point on the surface of a space object and its corresponding point in the image is determined by the camera imaging geometric model, and these geometric model parameters are camera parameters.
This paper introduces the dual-attention mechanism which a common algorithm in natural language processing into the image visual processing and calibrates the image system with the combination of Zhang Zhengyou algorithm. Attention mechanism has always been a well-known mechanism in the field of natural language processing. It can effectively extract the deep meaning of the text context through the attention mechanism, and the feature area of the image can be extracted by introducing the attention mechanism into the field of image processing. On the basis of image acquisition, various feature information in the visual image is processed, analyzed and calculated. Combined with the Zhang Zhengyou algorithm, it can realize the measurement of the three-dimensional geometric size, morphology and position of the measured object, and the algorithm has good versatility, strong applicability and high accuracy.
