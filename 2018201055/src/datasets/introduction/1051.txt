Human–computer interaction is based on the research and implementation of computer interaction. Human–computer interaction is based on the interdisciplinary fields of computer technology and human–machine science [1]. It is also widely used in many fields, including modeling, design, evaluation and other theories and methods. Good human–computer interaction methods will fully understand human characteristics and pay more attention to user demand, so as to better realize human–computer interaction technology. In the process of human–computer interaction development, gesture interaction is increasingly used, thereby achieving higher popularity [2]. The use of gesture interaction will inevitably make people more convenient for human–computer interaction. Therefore, in the process of using gestures to interact, it is necessary to create a more natural and intuitive human–computer communication mode [3].
