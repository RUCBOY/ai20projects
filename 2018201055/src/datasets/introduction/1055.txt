Cellular automata (CA) is a grid dynamic system in which time, space and state are discrete, spatial interactions and causality relationship in time are local. Each variable takes only a limited number of states. The model meeting these rules can be regarded as a cellular automaton model. It generally does not have a strictly defined physical equation or function form, but consists of a series of rules.
CA was proposed to simulate the self-replication function of biological systems by the father of computers, von Neumann, in the early 1950s [1]. In 1986, M. Cremer and J. Ludwig applied CA to the research of vehicle traffic [2]. The most basic one-dimensional model in the cellular automaton traffic flow model is the 184 CA model [3], [4], which uses elements from grid point chain of one-dimension to simulate vehicles on the road. The state of the vehicle at the next moment is completely determined by the state of the vehicle itself and the two grid points before and after the vehicle. In 1992, Nagel K. and Schreckenberg M. proposed a cellular automaton model (NS model), considering the possibility of a car’s gradually restricted forward shifting and random reverse direction shifting [5].
In recent years, with the increasing demand for high-performance computing in the social economy, people’s enthusiasm for low-power, high-performance computers is becoming more and more intense. It makes researchers pay more and more attention to the research of new type of computers, such as quantum computers  [6], [7], biological computer [8], optical computer, etc. [9], [10], [11].
Optical computers have certain advantages in data width and parallel carry-free addition, etc. Therefore, they have attracted much attention. The research in photoelectric hybrid ternary optical computer (TOC) in Shanghai University is a more promising field. On March 18, 2017, the research team successfully operated a 36 bit MSD adder based on T, W, T′, W′, and T2 transformations (referred to as TM-MSD adder) [12], marking that the theory and technology of the optical reconfigurable photoelectric hybrid processor have matured, and the manufacturing technology has been feasible [9], [10], [11], [13]. The TOC has more advantageous than traditional electronic computer systems in solving problems that require more resources and repetitive computations.
At present, there are more and more researches on the potential applications for the TOC. The algorithm design of vector matrix multiplication [14], [15] is studied, iterative division algorithm for MSD number is designed and implemented [16]. The FFT algorithm is studied by using huge data bits of optical calculations with less clock cycles [17]. The implementation method of the DFT algorithm is studied by using bitwise allocation and reconfigurability of processor bits of the TOC in the literature [18].
From the characteristics that all the cells of a cellular automaton can be calculated in parallel, it is obviously advantageous to apply it to the application research with the TOC.
