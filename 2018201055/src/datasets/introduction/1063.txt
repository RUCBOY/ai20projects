Compared with electronic computing, optical computing has many advantages such as high parallelism, high information capability and so on [1], [2]. This makes computer based on optical computing has great advantages over its electronic counterpart. To take use of the advantages of optical computing, many scholars have set much research effort on optical computers from different aspects. And most of the studies are to try to construct all optical computer systems. However, because of the immaturity of some technologies and components in optical computing such as optical information storage [3], optical chip and so on, it is hard to realize all optical computer in a short time.
Based on the progress state of science and technologies in optical computing as well as electronic computing, Jin Yi et al. proposed the concept of Ternary Optical Computer (TOC) which is a photoelectric hybrid computer system. And they put forward its basic principle and designed its architecture [4], [5]. Combined with the intensity and polarization of light, they used three states of light such as horizontal polarization, vertical polarization and dark state to express ternary information in TOC. And they adopted liquid crystal and polarizer to construct operator and implement optical operation. Besides, they utilized electronic computer to control operation, decode data and store data. Since TOC was proposed, many theories such as decrease-radix design principle [6], reconfigurable theory [7] and so on have been established. And typical experimental systems have been constructed.
As carry delay is an unfavorable phenomenon that much affects the efficiency of numerical calculations, many scholars have tried many studies to solve the problem. For example, signed-digit (SD)algorithm, modified SD (MSD) algorithm, symbol replacement algorithm and so on are among the typical studies put forward [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. The SD and MSD algorithms are based on a new redundant numerical system, which ensures that addition be implemented without carry. These studies are very important especially to optical computer. As it may process applications with huge number of data bits which will lead to tremendous delay with traditional serial-delay based methods. Actually, since the principle of TOC was put forward, much research effort has focused on the problem of addition in TOC which is the basis of many other numerical calculation applications, and much progress has been obtained [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. For example, the theory and structure of MSD adder in TOC [17] is proposed and many studies have focused on the efficiency of MSD adder and light path of MSD adder [17], [18], [19], [20]. Using MSD addition as the basis, other numerical operations have also been studied, such as multiplication [21], [22] multiplication routine [23], division routine [24], discrete Fourier transform (DFT) [25], [26] and so on. These studies have verified the feasibility and proved the potential advantages of numerical operations on TOC. However, in these studies, users have to be familiar with the implementation and working principle of TOC before they could use the optical computer. This much affects the utilization and development of it.
Considering multiplication is one of the most important mathematical operation and also the basis of many other numerical applications such as fast Fourier transform, matrix–vector multiplication and so on, design a way to simplify the MSD multiplication on TOC is needed and important. To attain this goal, the mechanisms and methods about the implementation of multiplication application on TOC without needing the participation of users are put forward. And an MSD multiplication platform on TOC is designed and implemented. With the platform, users easily implement multiplication application using the advantages of optical computing without needing to know any details about TOC.
