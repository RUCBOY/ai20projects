Different definition to the fractional derivatives FD’s have been proposed in the literature. Here, the attention is focused to the Caputo, Caputo–Fabrizio, and the Atangana–Baleanu FD’s.
Computer viruses act as gross threat to computers network security as they can hide in digital data in whatever form it is stored. They can self-replicate through other programs or files and infect them. They can utilize all means of communications to spreading across computer networks. They turn backs on to legitimate application code in order to spread and reproduce themselves. A defensive plan is eminent against epidemic computer viruses through the use of antiviruses. In the literature, much research has focused on making networks feasible and useful. Formal methods, theory, and supporting tools can be helpful in tackling such problem. So, in order to study the spread of computer viruses, mathematical models on the dynamics of the epidemics of computer viruses and antiviruses are required.
Some mathematical models to the suspected, infected, and recovered SIR dynamical system, in biology, were proposed. A model of computer virus–antivirus propagation dynamics based on the topology nature of the internet was established in Ren et al. [1], where the stability of virus-free equilibrium is analyzed via a limiting value associated with the topology of the Internet and the model parameters. The effect of propagation of countermeasures on viral spread was investigated in Liu and Li [2]. To this end, a new virus-antivirus spreading model was proposed, wherein, stability of the equilibrium and numerical simulations were carried. In [3], a model was proposed based on the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) stochastic epidemic model for computer viruses which accounts for merging the time Markov chain of the minimal traffic model and controlling the virus propagation. A mechanism to measure and compare the relative ability of antiviruses against various kinds of viruses was presented in Paul and Mishra [4] via establishing a hierarchical structure for the different virus defense mechanisms.
Antivirus software is the most widely known product in the class of malware protection products. The dynamic interaction between these two antagonistic software programs, has motivated many research works which are based on the extended SIR dynamical system by impeding the dynamics of the antivirus. In [5], [6], [7], [8], a way is initiated towards modeling the specific characteristics of computer virus by following the macroscopic technique. The microscopic approach, presented in Ren et al. [1] has lead to triggering the efforts on the development of antivirus programs based on the previous recognition of the infection code, based on models developed in Liu and Li [2]. In [9], [10], [11], the uniform prediction of computer virus spread in connected networks has been investigated. Also, the dynamical response of a computer virus on the internet was analyzed. Fractional nonlinear dynamical systems NLDS have been studied by many researchers in Handam and Freihat [12], Bulut et al. [13], Singh et al. [14], Lu et al. [15], Kumar et al. [16], Atangana and Alkahtani [17], Choudhary et al. [18], Atangana and Baleanu [19], Yusuf A. et al. [20], Caputo and Fabrizio [21], Losada and Nieto [22], Singh et al. [23]. The objective in this work is to present a unified study of the epidemic-antivirus nonlinear dynamical system. Here it is the susceptible-infected-recovered and antidotal SIRA [11]. First, the conditions for integrability of this system are depicted. Second, the exact solutions of this NLDS are obtained by using the extended unified methods [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], which were proposed by the first author. Numerical investigations of the solutions for the SIRA computers are carried.
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the different definitions of fractional derivatives FDs are given with a new defined fractional derivative which we call Gawad’s FD. The reduction of the FD to non-autonomous ordinary derivative is established.
Section 3 is devoted to finding the conditions for integrability and the exact solutions of the non-autonomous classical SIRA equations. Numerical results are carried in Section 4 in the Caputo and Caputo Fabrizio cases. The other cases are not dealt with to avoid the lengthiness of the paper which can be detailed in a separate work. Conclusions are given in Section 5.
