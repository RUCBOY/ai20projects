With the rapid development of smart technologies, the dependence of society on the internet is growing exponentially and so is the security threats from computer viruses in networks [4], [23]. Therefore, the safe reliability of the internet appears to be very important. These modern smart technologies exposes us to serious challenges. The spreading of malicious codes online based on ingenious deception strategies poses serious threats to our privacy, safety and finances [11]. They are capable of retrieving personal information from network users such as passwords, usernames and financial transactions. These causes catastrophic damages to individuals and big corporations with millions of dollars [6], [20], [25].
Mathematical models have been proposed to better understand the dynamics of these virulent codes in a networkof computers by several others [5], [13], [19], [20]. Murray [19] presented the first propagation model of computer virus. Thereafter, numerous various propagation models have been studied [1], [7], [8], [9], [12], [22], [29]. In [1], [12], Susceptible–Infected–Susceptible (SIS) models were introduced. The Susceptible–Infected–Removed (SIR) model were introduced by [22], [29]. The SIR model were improved by [7], [8], [9] by introducing Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered–Susceptible models (SIRS). Currently [10], [18], [21], [24], [28] added more compartments by developing another model known as the SEIQR model. In this model, we have the susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I), quarantined (Q) and recovered (R) compartments. They introduced a new class of exposed and quarantined computers. This has led to a better understanding of the dynamics of virulent codes in a network of computers. In this models, stability analysis have been performed. These models were solved using MATLAB’s ode45.
Here, we extend the work done by Mishra [18]. We improve the SEIQR model presented in this model. In addition to extending this model, we solve modified model using a new pseudo spectral method which is efficient and computational efficient than the MATLAB’s ode45. The modified model is termed the MSEIQR model. In addition to the SEIQR, we include an extra assumption that the computers have an additional immune compartment. In addition, we assume that the computers are protected using anti-virus in this immune class. This a new assumption in our model and hence the additional class. The immunity is then lost and hence the computers become susceptible. We further assume that a proportion of the susceptible can be exposed or can be infected. The models above all assume that after being susceptible, the computers can only be exposed and then progress to infection which is not true for all the cases. Thus to precisely understand the dynamics, it is important to add this assumption. We also assume that Quarantined computers can also be removed from the system due to attack of malicious objects. New parameters like recruitment rate of immune computers, loss of immunity and gain of immunity by computers have been added to the model. The effect of these parameters on the dynamics of the system are presented in graphical form and discussed in detail in this article.
A detailed analysis of the model is presented in this article. Particularly, we present the meaningfulness of the model, the reproduction number, and the equilibria stability. Theorems on the stability analysis are stated and proved using mathematical principles. The stability analysis is also validated by means of numerical methods. In this article, we solve the MSEIQR model using both pseudospectral methods and MATLAB’s ode45 method. We show that the new pseudospectral method can be used as an alternative to MATLAB’s ode45. The pseudospectral method entitled piecewise pseudospectral relaxation method (PPRM) is developed and presented in detail for a general system of n initial values problems in this article. Results obtained are in excellent agreement with MATLAB’s ode45. This method is robust, uses few nodes and obtain results in a fraction of a second.
In Section 2, the mathematical formulation of the model is presented. In Sections 3 Analysis of the model, 4 Piecewise pseudospectral relaxation method, stability analysis and numerical method are presented respectively. Results are discussed in Section 5 and we conclude this article in Section 6. We present the mathematical formulation in the next section.
