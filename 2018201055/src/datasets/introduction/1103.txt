Duplex stainless steel (DSS) has wide applications in various industries, such as chemical, energy, and offshore plants. DSS has a microstructure composed of a balanced austenite (γ) and ferrite (α) phase and has excellent properties, such as high strength and toughness, high corrosion resistance, and good weldability. However, during welding and depending on the thermal cycles, DSS undergoes complex microstructural and phase changes that affect the α/γ phase balance [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. The microstructure of the weld metal (WM) differs from that of the base metal because the WM solidifies into single-phase α (F mode) to precipitate Widmanstätten γ [12]. On the other hand, in the heat-affected zone (HAZ), the fraction of the γ phase decreases, and the α/γ phase balance deviates from the appropriate ratio. Therefore, intermetallic compounds, such as Cr-carbide and nitride, and σ and χ phases get easily precipitated in the HAZ [10,[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Thus, when using DSS in industries, such as in chemical plants where the HAZ surface can come into contact with various gases, ensuring resistance to corrosion is necessary. However, the mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of DSS are greatly influenced by the α/γ balance [11,[22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively review the prediction and control of α/γ phase transformation in DSS welding. There are some studies on the phase transformation behavior of DSS and the nucleation and growth mechanisms of the secondary phase. On the other hand, few studies have investigated the kinetics of α/γ phase transformation [12,[30], [31], [32]]. According to previous reports, the growth of the γ phase is according to the impingement effect described by the Austin–Rickett equation, which clearly explains the transformation behavior of the γ phase in the over-cooled α phase [33]. Besides, isothermal heating data was used to predict γ phase formation in the continuously cooled HAZ [34,35]. However, only the precipitation phenomenon was considered—and that in a limited temperature range—and to use it to predict the γ amount of a multi-pass weld is unreasonable if both precipitation and dissolution phenomena are not considered in multiple temperature ranges. In a recent study [36,37], the authors evaluated the kinetics of α/γ phase transformation (precipitation and dissolution of γ phase) in the HAZ of DSS welds (standard, lean, and super). The amount of γ in the single-welded HAZ section was derived by numerical analysis and compared according to the composition of the DSS. As a result, it was confirmed that the behavior of the γ phase precipitation and dissolution followed the Austin-Rickett type equation, and the kinetics of phase transformation were clarified by revealing the relationship with the temperature dependence of the rate constant. However, in multi-pass welds, the weld metal (WM) and HAZ are reheated several times by subsequent welding thermal cycles, and as such, the dissolution and precipitation of the γ phase take place alternately during the welding process. Moreover, due to microstructural changes, the kinetics of the γ phase, dissolution and precipitation, will be different in the multi-pass WM and HAZ (base material). Therefore, due to this complex phase transformation behavior during the thermal cycle, the α/γ phase transformation in the multi-pass weld is difficult to predict in a quantitative manner. Additionally, the amount of γ phase decreases in the HAZ of each welding pass; however, it can be recovered by subjecting it to the heat effect of the subsequent pass. However, for the HAZ of the final welding pass, the ratio of α/γ becomes misaligned. This is due to the insufficient precipitation of γ because the heat of the subsequent pass remains unaffected. Thus, the final welding pass may be negatively influenced by mechanical properties and corrosion resistance.
Therefore, in the present study, a kinetics approach for α/γ phase transformation was utilized in the multi-pass welding of DSS. The dissolution and precipitation behavior of the γ phase was investigated for the base metal HAZ. The γ phase fraction in the multi-pass welding of DSS was numerically calculated in combination with thermal conductivity analysis during multi-pass welding. Finally, based on computer prediction, a new microstructure improvement welding process was proposed to restore the γ phase fraction of the final weld.
