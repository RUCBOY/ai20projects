Breast cancer is the most deadly cancer for women in developing countries and the second most deadly cancer for those in developed nations.[1] Mammograms are an essential component in early detection of breast cancer, and interpretation sensitivity greatly affects patient survival rates.[2] On the other hand, imperfect specificity of breast lesion diagnosis by mammography causes physical and psychological discomfort to false positive patients who are subjected to further, possibly invasive tests.[3], [4] As a result, a variety of Computer Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems designed to provide quantitative, objective mass classification have been developed.[5]
Existing CADx techniques for mass classification generally fall into two categories: segmentation-dependent methods, which require a detailed outline of the lesion upon which to compute features for classification, and segmentation-free methods, which do not. Segmentation-dependent methods tend to rely on predefined sets of features, while segmentation-free approaches leverage representation learning techniques to learn explanatory features directly from the available data. Segmentation-free approaches could provide substantial value in clinical practice by obviating the need for detailed segmentations, but have only recently been able to achieve results similar to those of segmentation-dependent methods.[6], [7], [8], [9] Though recent studies of segmentation-free approaches have shown promising results, CADx systems for mass classification have rarely been evaluated on the same datasets, making the type of comparative performance analysis that should precede clinical deployment difficult to perform.[8] Major limitations to the evaluation of different mammography CADx systems on common datasets have ranged from insufficient descriptions of model implementation in the original literature to challenges with data availability and provenance.
In this work, we leverage the recent Curated Breast Imaging Subset of the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) to compare segmentation-free and segmentation-dependent approaches to automated mass classification on a standard, public dataset. To perform this comparison, we implement four different techniques from the literature: a segmentation-free Bag-of-Visual-Words (BoVW) mass classification algorithm inspired by traditional computer vision,[10] a segmentation-free Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained using commodity deep learning software,[11] a segmentation-dependent algorithm based on the Rubber-Band Straightening Transform (RBST) of Sahiner et al.,[6] and the segmentation-dependent approach of Huo et al. that combines predefined features with an artificial neural network.[7] Evaluating the performance of each of these techniques on the CBIS-DDSM test set after training and tuning was performed using the standard CBIS-DDSM training set yields several useful conclusions. First, we observe that malignancy classification performance on the CBIS-DDSM dataset obtained using the segmentation-free BoVW method is comparable to that of the best segmentation-dependent methods, but also find that the segmentation-free CNN model substantially and significantly (p<0.05) outperforms each of these by 11 points of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AZ). These results reinforce recent findings suggesting that representation learning techniques such as BoVW and CNN can obviate the need for precise or method-specific lesion segmentation while maintaining high levels of performance. Second, we find that our re-implementations of existing segmentation-free methods yield performance levels on CBIS-DDSM inferior to those achieved on the original evaluation datasets reported in the literature. We propose that these discrepancies result from some combination of differences in the segmentation techniques used, parameter tuning on small datasets in the original work, and implementation choices.
