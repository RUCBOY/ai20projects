Most of the work on interfacial segregation in multi-component alloys consisting of five or more elements has been conducted on the Cantor alloy (an equi-molar combination of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. However, this literature is quite sparse, as only four of these papers have addressed modeling issues [1], [2], [5], [6], and only two have dealt with surface segregation. Some of these papers [3], [4], [5] have reported experimental measurements on grain boundaries, but the measurements were conducted at temperatures where the alloys consist of more than one phase [7], thereby complicating the interpretation of the results.
Our own previous work [1] has consisted of atomistic simulations of interfacial segregation, performed by a combination of Monte Carlo (MC), molecular dynamics (MD) and molecular statics (MS) approaches, used in conjunction with modified embedded atom method (MEAM) potentials, developed specifically for the case of systems consisting of the five Cantor alloy components [8]. A typical computer simulation performed by our approach requires the use of ~100 parallel processors for 2 to 3Â h on a computation cell consisting of 8000 atoms. In the present paper, we develop an analytical model for N-component surfaces using a simple nearest neighbor approach in the regular solution approximation, which describes the surface as a stack of atom layers, for consistency with the Gibbs adsorption isotherm. The analytical model is tested for the 5-component Cantor alloy and its underlying binaries. While the predictions of this analytical approach are presumably less reliable than those of the atomistic simulations, a computation by means of the analytical model takes no longer than a few seconds on a typical laptop. Thus, one of the issues investigated in this paper is the possibility of using the multilayer analytical model to map out general trends in multinary alloys, as a guide to subsequent massive atomistic simulations that produce presumably more reliable results.
The primary thrust of our previous work [1] was on grain boundary segregation, although some attention was also paid to surface segregation. In contrast, the focus of the present study will be on surface rather than grain boundary behavior, because the available analytical models for the description of segregation at surfaces contain fewer adjustable parameters than those for grain boundaries [9].
We also investigate whether the results of segregation in a quinary system can be inferred from results obtained on the underlying binary systems, because the inputs needed to model two-component systems are much more readily available than those suitable for a five-component system.
As mentioned in a paper that has investigated significant portions of the Co-Cr-Fe-Mn-Ni phase diagram by a combination of experiments and CALPHAD calculations [7], the CALPHAD method is appropriate for the study of high entropy alloy (HEA) phase diagrams. Similarly, this paper aims to test an easily implemented analytical approach, using the regular solution approximation, to model surface behavior, in order to establish the extent to which such an approach might be valid for studying interfacial segregation in HEAs. Finally, this model can also provide a useful tool to map the variation of properties over the whole complex composition space of multinary alloys, for comparison to high-throughput experimental data, such as that recently reported for the catalytic properties of a ternary alloy system [10].
