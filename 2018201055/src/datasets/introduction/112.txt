Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) issues in friction brakes are one of the most relevant customer claims in the automotive industry and also omnipresent in rail vehicles [1], [2], [3], [4]. During the last two decades, research activities, cf. Fig. 5 (a), have addressed fundamental instability mechanisms [5], [6], [7], design countermeasures [8], [9], advanced computational modeling [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], signal analysis [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], uncertainty analysis [21], [22], [23], [24] and many more using experimental data and numerical models. However, until today the model prediction quality is mostly unsatisfactory [25], [26]. The understanding of the actual instantaneous system conditions, responsible for self-excitation mechanisms of real-world braking applications, is only very limited. Decades of brake squeal research illustrate the fugitive character of the highly nonlinear, multi-scale and potentially chaotic friction-induced vibrations (FIV) [15], [25], [27], [28].
Whenever systems are studied experimentally [29], [30], [31], the occurrence of NVH-related vibrations and noise generation mechanisms has to be monitored. While the detection of large-amplitude oscillations in sensor measurements of a brake system may seem trivial, the automatic detection and classification of typical brake sounds is still challenging. Identification of vibrations and noise in measurements plays a crucial role in both academia and industry: in the era of big data and deep learning [32] large amounts of data are recorded which rule out manual approaches. Cost-intensive design decisions, tailored research approaches and countermeasures are based on the NVH assessment of a brake system, and thus on the NVH events encountered during testing. Higher detection quality and accuracy is therefore of fundamental interest. To reduce FIV in brake systems, unstable regimes must be identified. From an energetic perspective, the friction interface provides energy input to the structure composed of multiple parts and assembled by mechanical joints [33], [34], [35] which add significant amounts of damping and nonlinearity [36], [37]. Furthermore, the structure experiences external loads, such as excitation from the road, and changing environmental conditions, such as changing ambient temperatures. Stability, and thus the vibration behavior of the structure, is governed by the flow, localization and balance of energy between sources and sinks. Due to temperature-dependent material parameters, non-linear force–displacement characteristics and ever-changing friction interfaces conditions [38], [39], local and global stiffness and damping parameters vary between and during brake operations, leading to changing system stability [40]. As a result, the structure may exhibit rich and intricate bifurcation behavior with respect to one or multiple parameters [6], [41], [42]. Given the complexity of the system, one cannot assume a single parameter, such as the relative sliding velocity of the brake pad, to generally initiate instability and to dominate the overall bifurcation behavior. Instead, combinations of various parameters, their instantaneous changes as well as their historical values, do drive the system dynamics. The rich corpus of research on frictional systems has identified various mechanisms for instability [43], such as stick–slip [43], [44], a negative friction slope [45], [46], [47] and mode-coupling [5], [7], [48]. However, most of these mechanisms represent idealized single-point contact systems. Spatially distributed contacts are well-known for adding aspects of synchronization [49], multi-stability [42], [50], [51] and localization [52], [53], i.e. complicating the picture of stability drastically. Previous work [19] on extracting the instantaneous growth rates from experimental data, i.e. quantifying linear stability and instantaneous damping, illustrates the sensitivity of the effective damping with respect to loading conditions. As a result, and along with the aforementioned parametric changes to the system properties, it remains a difficult task to identify and understand the underlying parameter space and conditions that drive a real brake system into instability.
1.1. System understandingFig. 1 visualizes various aspects of multi-physic loads, parameter variations, self-excitation and transient noise encountered during brake operation. The mechanical components interact with the driver’s deceleration request and internal states like the friction coefficient and component temperatures change. These parametric changes can cause instability of the steady sliding state, leading to non-stationary, high-intensity and high-frequency non-equilibrium dynamics. From a classical modeling perspective that is concerned with stability analysis by complex eigenvalues, the parameter variation causes positive real parts that destabilize the equilibrium state. A detailed time–frequency analysis of the vibration measurement allows to characterize the system response qualitatively and quantitatively. Fig. 1 displays the actual loads recorded on a dynamometer, the emitted sound pressure (SP) recorded by a microphone, and the Gabor transform of the A-weighted sound pressure level (SPL) for a single brake operation. It becomes obvious that slow processes, i.e. the loads, as well as fast processes, i.e. interface dynamics, vibrations and sound emissions, are involved in the brake dynamics. As the loads interact with each other, and with the structure itself, we consider the overall dynamical system to complex owing to its multi-physic, multi-scale, and non-stationary characteristics.Download : Download high-res image (347KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. An example of a single brake stop and measurements of disk rotation Ω, brake line pressure p, ambient temperature Tamb and relative air humidity H. As a consequence, other system parameters change, such as the disk surface temperature Trot, the brake fluid temperature Tfluid and the friction coefficient μ. These parameter variations can render the system unstable and let friction-induced vibrations grow until eventually audible noise, especially squeal, is emitted.
1.2. Data from brake system testingThe data sets used in this work have been recorded according to test protocols derived from the SAE-J2521 procedure [54]. Quarter-car sections are subjected to the protocol on a dynamometer test bench. A matrix test is conducted for variations of the type of braking (stop or drag braking), different durations and various combinations of operational parameters, such as rotational velocity, brake line pressure or ambient air temperature. For running-in and conditioning the system, 30 brake stop are conducted in the beginning of each test run. Then, nine temperature ramps at several pressure and velocity levels are performed. Overall, the protocol is designed to cover a wide range of brake scenarios. Fig. 2 depicts the evolution of three temperature measurements (rotor Trot, ambient Tamb and fluid Tfluid), the initial rotor velocity (Ω) and the brake pressure (p) values for a complete test run of 1206 brakings. The time evolution of the loading parameters is recorded in the form of time series data sampled at fs=100 Hz. A microphone located in proximity to the brake disc with a sampling frequency of fs=51.2 kHz monitors the development of brake noise. Typical sequences measured during a single stop braking are displayed in Fig. 1.Download : Download high-res image (414KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2.

1.3. Objectives and structure of this workGiven the abundance of data in the domain of friction-induced vibrations and brake noise, we were interested in better understanding the potentials and limitations of applying recent data-driven approaches that are nowadays omnipresent in many fields science and technology [55]. However, so far there has been no attempt to leverage the potential of machine learning to study friction-induced noise of brake systems - which we will do within this study for the first time by illustrating pathways for data-driven treatment of friction-induced vibrations which will hopefully be fruitful in fostering further research in this field.The first part of this study is concerned with a novel brake noise detector for NVH applications in brake systems to locate and characterize friction phenomena using microphone recordings. The design of a data-driven virtual twin for the brake behavior is presented in the second part, where the loading sequences are used as input to predict the vibrational response of brake systems. The noise detector from the first part finds here its application to label large data sets in a completely automated fashion.
