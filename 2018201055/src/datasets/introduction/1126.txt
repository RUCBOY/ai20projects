Computer-aided engineering (CAE) is referred to as a numerical simulation process for analyzing the performance of a product in a broad range of industries. Nowadays the CAE simulation has become a key element in developing industry 4.0 and digital twin technology. However, current CAE relies on a preprocessing step where the geometric models generated by computer-aided geometry design (CAGD) software need to be converted to the ones suitable for simulation. This geometric model data transfer step is the most laborious, manual-intervention procedure in the CAE and introduces geometry errors. To resolve this problem, the isogeometric analysis (IGA) [15] with boundary element methods (IGABEM) is proposed to integrate geometric modeling and numerical simulation [21], [33], [35]. With IGABEM, numerical simulation can be conducted directly from the exact geometric models in CAGD, avoiding geometric errors and cumbersome preprocessing procedures. Hence, compared to the Finite Element Method (FEM) which is dominating in numerical analysis, IGABEM significantly reduces simulation time and enhances computational accuracy. On the other hand, due to the dependence of fundamental solutions, IGABEM is mainly restricted to linear problems, so it is not as versatile as FEM. In addition, IGABEM forms asymmetric full matrices, which results in large memory cost. Since its inception, IGABEM has been successfully applied to elastic mechanics [31], fracture mechanics [27], [28], potential problems [38], [44], wave-resistance [13], electromagnetics [36], and structural shape optimization in [2], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [32], [40], [43].
In addition to the aforementioned merits, IGABEM has prominent advantages in simulating acoustics problems. Acoustics found wide applications in a variety of engineering areas, such as noise control, sonar for underwater navigation, non-destructive testing, ultrasound medical imaging, seismology, bioacoustics, electroacoustic communications, etc. Acoustics poses great challenge to many numerical simulation algorithms since the acoustic wave may propagate in semi-infinite domains. IGABEM can circumvent this difficulty by transferring the acoustic field in a semi-infinite domain to that on the inner boundary of the domain. First application of IGABEM to acoustics appeared in [34], [37]. Acoustic optimization with IGABEM was investigated by Chen et al. [7], Liu et al. [23] and Chen et al. [6] for 2D and 3D problems, respectively.
Different types of geometric modeling techniques have been actively investigated in the context of the IGABEM. Among them, subdivision surface method show great promise because it is able to construct multi-resolution geometries with complicated shapes and topologies [1], [3], [4], [25], [26], [29], [41], [42]. Subdivision surfaces can be categorized to two groups: Catmull-Clark scheme and Loop scheme. Recently, IGABEM based on Loop subdivision surfaces was applied in [24] and [8] for structure-acoustic interaction and acoustic optimization, respectively. The present work is aimed to combine IGABEM with Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces. The advantage of Catmull-Clark scheme over loop scheme in subdivision surfaces is the higher accuracy in simulation due to use of quadrilateral meshes. Moreover, we will use the Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to accelerate the solution procedure.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The second section introduces the Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces algorithm.The third section presents the implementation of isogeometric boundary element method based on Catmull-Clark subdivision surfaces for acoustics. Numerical examples are demonstrated in Section 4 followed by conclusions in Section 5.
