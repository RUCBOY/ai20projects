Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a way to study neural correlates of consciousness involving perception, memory, learning, thinking, and affection by measuring hemodynamic response to mental stimuli. In an fMRI experiment, the experimental subject is asked to participate in mental tasks in response to the stimuli, while the subject’s brain is scanned by a magnetic resonance (MR) scanner at regular time intervals to collect observation data. For event-related (ER) fMRI experiments, mental stimuli as brief as several milliseconds can be detected by high-speed MR scanners so that transient brain activity can be explored. Each observation at a constant time interval is supposed to be affected by not only the current stimulus but also the preceding stimuli. In that sense, observations from an ER-fMRI experiment may be viewed as time series data and an experiment is designed based on a multiple linear regression model to estimate hemodynamic response functions (HRFs) for plural types of stimuli. In an ER-fMRI experiment, the number of stimuli in a brief duration can be huge and this gives rise to challenging research problems for statistical designs. In this paper, we focus on designs of ER-fMRI experiments (fMRI experiments for short). We refer the reader to Lazar (2008) for an overview of statistical methods in fMRI experiments, Kao and Stufken (2015) for a review of some previous works on designs for fMRI experiments, and Cheng and Kao, 2015, Cheng et al., 2017 for a general theory of guiding the selection of fMRI designs to estimate the HRF. A detailed description of experimental settings and the statistical model for an fMRI experiment with a single type of stimulus is given in the next section.
M-sequences can provide fMRI designs (see Buračas and Boynton, 2002). In the binary case, such designs are shown to be optimal under certain optimality criterion in estimating the HRF (see Kao, 2014). However, for such fMRI designs, only few stimulus effects can be estimated. Lin et al. (2017b) tried to find fMRI designs overcoming this problem by introducing the concept of a circulant almost orthogonal array (CAOA) as a comprehensive framework of fMRI designs.
Definition 1.1A circulant k×n array A with alphabet S of size s is said to be a circulant almost orthogonal array (CAOA) with s levels, strength t and bandwidth b, denoted by CAOA(n,k,s,t,b), if, in any t×n subarray of A, |λ(a1)−λ(a2)|≤b holds for any pair of ordered t-tuples a1 and a2 of S, where λ(a) is a subarray-dependent frequency of a∈St as column vectors. The first row of A is called the generating vector of A. Especially when b=0, A is simply called a circulant orthogonal array (COA).
Example 1.2The following is an example of CAOA(10,5,2,2,1). A=10010010111100100101111001001001110010011011100100.Its generating vector is (1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,1). It can be observed that, in any pair of distinct rows of A, λ((0,0)⊤)=λ((1,1)⊤)=2andλ((0,1)⊤)=λ((1,0)⊤)=3,or λ((0,0)⊤)=λ((1,1)⊤)=3andλ((0,1)⊤)=λ((1,0)⊤)=2.
In an fMRI experiment, the parameter k of a CAOA is considered as the number of time points taken into account to estimate HRFs for the respective types of stimuli. In this sense, k is ideal to be at least the duration of an HRF from the onset of a stimulus to the HRF’s complete return to baseline. However, even for s=t=2, the maximum values of k for ‘optimal’ CAOAs with small b have not been determined for all n, and the values of k for previously known CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) with n≡2(mod4) are bounded above by n∕2. That is why our purpose is to find ‘efficient’ CAOAs with larger k as well as ‘optimal’ CAOAs.
As a general theory of selecting ‘optimal’ CAOA(n,k,2,2,b), we can refer to Cheng and Kao (2015) for n≡0,1,3(mod4), and Lin et al. (2017b) for n≡2(mod4). In Lin et al. (2017b), we can also find, for n≤50 and b≤1, the generating vectors of optimal CAOA(n,k,2,2,b) and the values of k searched by computers as well as the previously known values of k. For n≡2(mod4), Lin et al. (2017b) classified CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) into three classes called T1, T2, and T3, where T1-CAOAs are ‘optimal’. Through computer search, Lin et al. (2017b) also found examples of ‘optimal’ CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) other than T1-CAOAs, but they did not go deep into it. In this paper, restricting to the case n≡2(mod4), we characterize the class of CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) of which Lin et al. (2017b) did not make a deeper investigation.
In the next section, we review the statistical model for estimating HRFs in an fMRI experiment with a single type of stimulus, and a class of optimality criteria, called “type 1”, for selection of designs. In Section 3, we propose the notion T3∗-CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) as a subclass of T3-CAOAs and show their optimality under type 1 criteria. In Section 4, we discuss the asymptotic optimality of CAOA(n,k,2,2,1). In Section 5, we demonstrate that algebraic constructions for perfect binary sequences can be applied to get efficient CAOA(n,k,2,2,1) with large k. Concluding remarks are given in the last section together with observations by computer search and some further problems.
