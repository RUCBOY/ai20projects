Myopia, or near-sightedness, is a refractive error of the eye that can be corrected by glasses or contact lenses. It is primarily caused by a combination of crystalline lens thinning and excessive elongation of the eyeball resulting in thinning of all retinal layers (Wong et al., 2010; Li et al., 2016). In particular, high degrees of myopia (−6 diopters or worse), is associated with retinal complications causing irreversible visual impairment later in life (Verhoeven et al., 2015). The prevalence of myopia has increased rapidly in the last decades. Over 80% of the university students in highly urbanized areas in East Asia are currently myopic; Europe is following with 50% of the young adults developing myopia (Foster and Jiang, 2014; Lin et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2015).
Known risk factors for myopia are lifestyle factors including lack of outdoor exposure, near work duration and near working distance (Huang et al., 2015; Ip et al., 2008; Rose et al., 2008a). Concerns or awareness of digital devices on children's health is increasing (Holloway et al., 2013; Ebbeck et al., 2016; American Academy of P. Media and young minds, 2016; Xiong et al., 2017a). The exact contribution of digital screens to the total time spent on near work by children is unknown, but a recent study showed that children aged 0 to 8 years spent on average more than 1 h per day on a computer, tablet or smartphone (Lauricella et al., 2015). However, there is still limited evidence of whether computer use is a risk factor for myopia (Smaldone et al., 2015). Cross-sectional studies showed conflicting results and evidence from longitudinal studies is scarce (Smaldone et al., 2015; Saw et al., 2002a). We analyzed data from the prospective birth cohort the Generation R study, where computer use was measured at the age of 3, 6 and 9 years. Our first aim was to determine the association between computer use and myopia and axial elongation. Our second aim was to relate the effect of computer use to other near work activities associated with myopia and axial elongation. The third aim was to investigate whether the effect of near work can be modified by outdoor exposure.
