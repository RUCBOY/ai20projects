Interest in Single Board Computer (SBC) clusters has been growing since the initial release of the Raspberry Pi in 2012 [1]. Early SBC clusters, such as Iridis-Pi [2], were aimed at educational scenarios, where the experience of working with, and managing, a compute cluster was more important than its performance. Education remains an important use case for SBC clusters, but as the community has gained experience, a number of additional use cases have been identified, including edge computation for low-latency, cyber–physical systems and the Internet of Things (IoT), and next generation data centres [3].
The primary focus of these use cases is in providing location-specific computation. That is, computation that is located to meet some latency bound, that is co-located with a device under control, or that is located within some environment being monitored. Raw compute performance matters, since the cluster must be able to support the needs of the application, but power efficiency (GFLOPS/W), value for money (GFLOPS/$), and scalability can be of equal importance.
In this paper, we analyse the performance, efficiency, value-for-money, and scalability of modern SBC clusters implemented using the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B [4] or Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ [5], the latest technology available from the Raspberry Pi Foundation, and compare their performance to a competing platform, the Odroid C2 [6]. Compared to early work by Gibb [7] and Papakyriakou et al. [8], which showed that early SBC clusters were not a practical option because of the low compute performance offered, we show that performance improvements mean that for the first time SBC clusters have moved from being a curiosity to a potentially useful technology.
To implement the SBC clusters analysed in this paper, we developed a new SBC cluster construction technique: the Pi Stack. This is a novel power distribution and control board, allowing for increased cluster density and improved power proportionality and control. It has been developed taking the requirements of edge compute deployments into account, to enable these SBC clusters to move from educational projects to useful compute infrastructure.
We structure the remainder of this paper as follows. The motivations for creating SBC clusters and the need for analysing their performance are described in Section 2. A new SBC cluster creation technique is presented and evaluated in Section 3. The process used for the benchmarking and the results obtained from the performance benchmarks are described in Section 4. As well as looking at raw performance, power usage analysis of the clusters is presented in Section 5. The results are discussed in Sections Section 6, 7 describes how this research could be extended. Finally Section 8 concludes the paper.
