Dry-cured ham plays an important role of the world's food culture. It is popular with consumers, especially in China and the Mediterranean [1]. Jinhua, Xuanwei and Rugao hams are three major hams in China, whose unique aroma are favored by consumers. Aroma is one of the most important sensory characteristics associated with its volatile composition [2]. The traditional grading method of dry-cured hams depends on sensory evaluation technicians' experiences. They classify the hams by smelling the aroma adsorbed on the bamboo sticks which are stuck into the hams [3]. However, the grading results are affected by various subjective factors and lack repeatability, which can even cause the dispute among the sensory evaluation technicians. So, it is necessary to find rapid and objective methods to evaluate and discriminate the quality of dry-cured hams.
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy can be used to characterize the molecular structural characteristics, and related researches have been carried out to predict the quality of dry-cured hams [4,5]. However, it is much more difficult to analyze food samples by IR due to the complex matrix. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy is a rapid method [6], which can get multi-level information from macro to micro [7], and was used as the rapid identification of the authenticity of food [8] and drug [9]. Recently, with the development of infrared instrument and computer technology, Tri-step infrared spectroscopy has been established to explore the molecular structure information in foods [10]. Tri-step spectroscopy is FT-IR integrated with second derivative infrared spectroscopy (SD-IR) and two-dimensional correlation infrared spectroscopy (2DCOS-IR). SD-IR can be used to handle severely overlapped spectra and enhance the apparent resolution [8]. If the differences in FT-IR and SD-IR spectra are still hard to tell, 2DCOS-IR can further be employed to unfold FT-IR spectra in a second dimension to identify the differences [11]. Tri-step infrared spectroscopy has been proved as an efficient approach for sample discrimination [12] and quality control [13].
Computer vision technology is another method which could achieve rapid discrimination and has huge potentiality applied to food industry [14]. The intelligent sensory system with the image sensor mimics human eyes to acquire the image of the object to evaluate the quality of food [15]. It has been reported that the computer vision technology can provide a more representative result than the colorimeter on the prediction of pork color [16]. In recent years, computer vision technology implemented with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been carried out to evaluate and predict the quality of Iberian dry-cured hams [17,18]. However, there is limited research on Chinese dry-cured hams.
In this study, Chinese traditional dry-cured hams (Jinhua, Xuanwei and Rugao hams) from three different geographical origins and three different quality grades were evaluated by the Tri-step infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR, SD-IR and 2DCOS-IR) and computer vision technology. A rapid, subjective and efficient method was in an attempt to establish a characterize and discriminate the organoleptic quality of Chinese dry-cured hams comprehensively.
