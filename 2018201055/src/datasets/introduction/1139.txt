Plenty of complicated problems in science, finance and engineering have been solved with satisfied precision by means of high performance digit computers. However, even using the most advanced computers, some problems such as chaotic dynamical systems [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], are still rather difficult to solve.
It is well known that all numerical simulations are not “clean”: more or less numerical noises (i.e. truncation error and round-off error) always exist, which depend on numerical algorithms and data precision, respectively. In many cases, such kind of numerical noises can be controlled to such a tiny level (much smaller than variables under investigation) that their influence can be almost neglected. However, numerical noises increase exponentially for chaotic dynamic systems due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC), which was first discovered by Poincaré [7] in 1890 and rediscovered by Lorenz [8] in 1963 with a more famous name “butterfly effect”. Thus, for a chaotic dynamic system, a very tiny variation of initial condition may bring a huge difference of numerical simulations after a long enough time [5], [9]. Furthermore, as reported by Lorenz [10] a chaotic system is sensitive not only to initial condition but also to numerical algorithm: the (maximum) Lyapunov exponent of a chaotic model always alters between negative and positive values even when the time-step becomes rather small. Teixeira et al. [11] further investigated the time step sensitivity of three nonlinear atmospheric models by means of traditional algorithms in double precision, and made a rather pessimistic conclusion that “for chaotic systems, numerical convergence cannot be guaranteed forever”.
Certainly, the reliability of computer-generated simulation of chaotic systems is a fundamental problem. Anosov [12] and Bowen [13] proved that uniformly hyperbolic systems have the so-called shadowing property, say, a computer-generated (or noisy) orbit will stay close to (shadow) true orbits with adjusted initial conditions for arbitrarily long times [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. However, it is a pity that hardly any of chaotic systems is uniformly hyperbolic. Dawson et al. [18] showed that the non-existence of such shadowing trajectories may be caused by finite-time Lyapunov exponents of a system fluctuating about zero. For the non-hyperbolic chaotic systems with unstable dimension variability, no true trajectory of reasonable length can be found to exist near any numerical trajectories [19]. It was found [20] that extremely small numerical noises might result in macroscopic errors even in simulation average statistics that are several orders of magnitude larger than the noise level. Thus, the good promise from the Shadow Lemma [12], [13] for a uniformly hyperbolic system does not work on many non-hyperbolic systems [21]. It seems that we had to be satisfied with finite-length shadows for non-hyperbolic systems [22]. Note that most of investigations on shadows are based on low dimensional dynamic systems, although a shadowing algorithm for high dimensional systems was proposed [22]. To the best of our knowledge, neither rigorous shadowing theorems nor practical shadowing algorithms have been proposed for spatio-temporal chaotic systems governed by nonlinear PDEs with an infinite number of dimensions. It seems that, although the shadowing concept is rigorous in mathematics, it is hardly used in practice for non-hyperbolic spatio-temporal chaotic systems that widely exist.
To overcome the above-mentioned limitations of traditional algorithms in double precision, Liao [23] suggested a numerical strategy in 2009, namely the “Clean Numerical Simulation” (CNS) [24], [25]. By means of the CNS, reliable/convergent numerical simulations of chaotic dynamical systems can be obtained in a controllable interval of time 0 ≤ t ≤ Tc, where Tc is called “critical predictable time”. The CNS is based on the high-order Taylor expansion method [26](1)f(t+Δt)=f(t)+∑m=1M1m!dmf(t)dtm(Δt)m,where f is a function, t and Δt denote the time and time-step, respectively, which is adopted to decrease the truncation error to a required level by means of a large enough order M, and the use of the multiple precision (MP, called the MPFR library in the C language) [27], which is adopted to decrease the round-off error to a required level via reserving a large enough number Ns of significant digit for all physical/numerical variables and parameters. Besides, an additional simulation with even smaller numerical noises is necessary to determine the critical predictable time Tc by comparing these two simulations with each other, as mentioned below.
The CNS is based on such a hypothesis that the level of numerical noises increases exponentially (in an average meaning) within an interval of time t ∈ [0, Tc], i.e.(2)E(t)=E0exp(κt),t∈[0,Tc],where the constant κ > 0 is called noise-growing exponent, E0 denotes the level of initial noises (i.e. truncation and round-off error), and E(t) is the level of evolving noises of numerical simulation, respectively. In theory, the critical predictable time Tc is governed by a critical level of noise Ec, say,(3)Ec=E0exp(κTc).Obviously, for a fixed value of Ec, the smaller the initial noise E0, the larger the critical predictable time Tc.
However, it is practically impossible to exactly calculate the evolving noise E(t), because we do not known the true solution. So, we need a practical method with satisfied accuracy to determine Tc. Let x ∈ Ω denote a vector of spatial coordinates, ϕ(x, t) be a numerical simulation reliable in t ∈ [0, Tc] with initial noise E0, and ϕ′(x, t) be another simulation (with the same physical parameters and the same initial/boundary conditions) in t∈[0,Tc′] with the initial noise E0′ that is several orders of magnitude smaller than E0. According to the hypothesis of exponential growing of numerical noise of chaotic systems, it holds Tc′>Tc and ϕ′(x, t) in t ∈ [0, Tc] should be much closer to the true solution than ϕ(x, t). Therefore, ϕ′(x, t) can be regarded as a benchmark solution to approximately calculate the noise of ϕ(x, t) in x ∈ Ω. So, in practice, Tc is determined by comparing ϕ(x, t) with a better simulation ϕ′(x, t) having smaller noise E0′. In this way, the numerical noise of ϕ(x, t) is guaranteed below the critical level Ec of noise in the temporal interval t ∈ [0, Tc] within the whole spatial domain x∈Ω. In other words, ϕ(x, t) is a “clean” numerical simulation (CNS) in t ∈ [0, Tc] and x∈Ω. This provides us a heuristic explanation of the strategy of the CNS. Note that the CNS works even for non-pyherbolic systems and thus is more general than the shadowing theorem [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17].
The CNS has been successfully used to gain reliable computer-generated simulations of many chaotic systems. For example, using traditional numerical algorithms in double precision, one often gains reliable/convergent numerical simulations of chaotic solution of Lorenz equation in a rather short interval, say, approximately [0, 32]. However, by means of the CNS, a convergent and reliable numerical simulation of the chaotic solution of Lorenz equations in a rather long interval [0, 10, 000] was obtained for the first time [28]. Besides, numerical noises of the CNS can be much smaller even than micro-level physical uncertainty so that, via the CNS, one can provide a rigorous theoretical evidence that the micro-level physical thermal fluctuation is the origin of the macroscopic randomness of Rayleigh–Bénard turbulent flows [29]. In addition, the CNS has been successfully adopted to find more than 2000 new periodic orbits of three-body system [30], [31], [32]. The discovery of these new periodic orbits were reported twice by New Scientist [33], [34], because only three families of periodic orbits of three-body problem were reported in three hundred years after Newton mentioned this famous problem! All of these illustrate the validity and potential of the CNS for complicated nonlinear problems.
A spatio-temporal chaos has an infinite number of dimensions in principle, and thus is more difficult to solve than a temporal chaos. It is worth noting that, the spatio-temporal chaos may have a close relationship with turbulence [35]. For the two-dimensional Rayleigh–Bénard turbulent flows described by the Navier–Stokes equations, the Galerkin–Fourier spectral method is used in the frame of the CNS, which is however rather time-consuming [29]. In this manuscript, we propose a new strategy of the CNS in physical space for spatio-temporal chaotic dynamic systems so as to greatly increase the computational efficiency. Then, using the reliable simulation given by the CNS as a benchmark solution, we further investigate the influence of the numerical noises on simulations of spatio-temporal chaos gained by the traditional algorithms in double precision. Using the sine-Gordon equation [36] as an example, we illustrate that numerical noises can lead to great deviations not only in spatio-temporal trajectories but also even in statistics for spatio-temporal chaos! The new strategy of the CNS in physical space provides us an efficient way to more accurately study lots of spatio-temporal chaotic systems in science and engineering in a long enough interval of time so as to reveal some new physical truths by means of clearing away numerical noises.
