Inductive reasoning (IR) considered as one of the most important component skill of almost all transversal skills (Molnár, Greiff, & Csapó, 2013; Söderqvist, Nutley, Ottersen, Grill, & Klingberg, 2012) such as problem solving (Wu & Molnár, 2018a, 2018b) and general intelligence (Klauer & Phye, 2008; Klauer, Willmes, & Phye, 2002; Sternberg and Gardner, 1983), it constitutes a driving force of cognitive development (Perret, 2015). It plays a central role in learning processes, such as knowledge acquisition and application (Bisanz, Bisanz, & Korpan, 1994; Hamers, De Koning, & Sijtsma, 2000; Klauer, 1990, 1996; Molnár et al., 2013; Pellegrino & Glaser, 1982) and is a good indicator of learning potential (Csapó & Nikolov, 2009; Resing, 1993). IR plays a part in a wide range of daily cognitive activities, including categorical generalization, analogical reasoning, causal reasoning or probabilistic judgement (Perret, 2015). “Inductive reasoning enables one to detect regularities, rules, or generalizations and, conversely, to detect irregularities. This is one way in which we structure our world” (Klauer et al., 2002, p. 1). This suggests that improving reasoning skills (Hattie & Anderman, 2013), especially, fostering IR should be part of formalized education, of the school activities explicitly (de Konig, 2000; Molnár, 2011; Resnick, 1987).
At the beginning of this millennium, almost the same ideas emerged, but in a new wave of teaching 21st-century skills (Molnár & Csapó, 2019; Voogt, Erstad, Dede, & Mishra, 2013; Wegerif, 2006). Fostering thinking skills or more specifically, a set of cognitive skills essential for learning and creating new knowledge became interesting concepts for educational policy (Wegerif, Li, & Kaufman, 2017; Vainikainen, Hautamaki, Hotulainen, & Kupiainen, 2015).
It is commonly assumed that the development of reasoning skills are embedded in the ordinary school material (de Konig, 2000), focusing mainly on reading writing and mathematics (Molnár, 2011). However, according to Molnár and Csapó (2019) there was no appreciable development noticeable regarding students reasoning skills in reading and science between Grades 2 and 6 and “there was a steady increase detectable in mathematics, especially in the first four years of schooling […] Overall, these results highlighted the importance, sensitivity and potential of the development of thinking skills in the early years of schooling”. Thus enhancing thinking skills must become a real goal in education (Vainikainen et al., 2015).
One of the major challenges in classroom teaching comes from the large differences between students in terms of their abilities. Training programs are needed which can be applied even on classroom level and which can handle the individual differences, can fit the actual needs of students’ cognitive level (Pásztor, 2016). Face-to-face programs are not very successful (Molnár & Lorincz, 2012) in this regard, but technology-based training programs can provide feasible solutions to address these challenges (Csapó, Lőrincz, & Molnár, 2012). Beyond adaptive fostering technology has the power of a higher level motivation by pupils of the 21st century (Csapó et al., 2012; McGaw et al., 2012)
In the present paper we address a technology-based training program of inductive reasoning for 9–11-year-old students and presents the direct result of the evaluation study. The online training consists of 120 playful problems based on Klauer’s “Cognitive training for children” concept and on his theory of inductive reasoning (Klauer, 1989). All of the problems are embedded in Mathematics content, thus the training tasks are applicable during normal school hours as part of the Mathematics lesson. According to our knowledge, it does not exist any online available training program in Arabic, which is empirically proved and focuses on the development of students’ inductive reasoning skills in educational context.
