Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The key factor in reducing the mortality is to find signs and symptoms of breast cancer at its early stage by clinical examination. The earlier the cancers are detected, the better the treatment provided. However, early detection requires an accurate and reliable diagnosis which should also be able to differentiate benign and malignant tumors. Previously, the most effective modality for detecting and diagnosing breast cancer is mammography [4]. However, there are some limitations of mammography in breast cancer detection. Mammography can hardly detect breast cancer in young women with dense breasts. Besides, the ionizing radiation of mammography can increase the health risk for the patients and radiologists. An important alternative to mammography is Breast Ultrasound (BUS) imaging. BUS imaging is preferred because of its noninvasive, nonradioactive and cost-effective nature [3] and it is more suitable for large-scale breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Also, the Ultrasound is more sensitive than mammography for detecting abnormalities in dense breasts, hence, it is more valuable for women younger than 35â€¯years of age. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) methods have been developed to improve the performance of the breast cancer diagnosis. In this work a CAD system is developed incorporating preprocessing by Speckle Reducing Anisotropic Diffusion (SRAD) [18], and segmentation using the active contour model. The texture features are extracted using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and are input to the classifier. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, Decision tree algorithm and Random Forest classifier are used and the accuracy of the classifiers is computed to identify the effective one for breast cancer detection using BUS images.
