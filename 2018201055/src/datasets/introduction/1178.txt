Pain, stress, and anxiety during and after the surgical insertion of dental implants have a major effect in patient rejection of dental implant as a viable choice for teeth replacement.1,2 Many patients argue about the risk of pain that may be encountered if they accepted such treatment. Even if the patient accepted the treatment, just knowing that suturing is needed after surgery could raise the level of anxiety which further increases the patient's perception of pain.3,4
Controlling pain and anxiety caused by implant surgery can be achieved surgically by minimally invasive procedures such as flapless implant surgery with immediate loading protocol (to avoid a second surgery for fixture exposure) and pharmacologically by the use of effective analgesics.5,6
Computer applications and systems are currently regarded as an integral facilitation technology in different medical aspects such as data analysis, computer guided therapy, imaging and telemedicine.7, 8, 9
Computer guided flapless implant surgery using cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is an accurate, simple and minimally invasive procedure that may not require suturing and thus yields a minimal perception of pain. It was reported to have a high success rate, which was found to be comparable to that of the open flap technique.10,11 The advancement of imaging techniques allowed the flapless implant surgery to be favored by many clinicians due to its reduced surgical time, faster wound healing, minimal bleeding and lesser amount of crestal bone resorption as the detachment of the periosteum is avoided.6
According to WHO (World Health Organization), paracetamol or acetaminophen is the first step on the pain control ladder and is considered as the first-line therapy for many painful conditions.12 Safety of this drug and its minimal side effects makes it a valuable choice for control of pain. Unlike NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), paracetamol does not cause adverse effects on bone metabolism or gastro-intestinal disturbances and can be prescribed safely for patients with gastritis and peptic ulcers.13,14
It was also found that paracetamol is able to decrease the unpleasantness when patients are subjected to noise blasts. This may suggest a great benefit when used before dental operations, as we continuously need to work with noisy tools.15
Ibuprofen on the other hand, is usually regarded as a more effective analgesic than paracetamol due to its additional anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting cyclooxygenases (COX-1 and COX-2).16 Unfortunately, inhibition of COX-1 affect mainly the gastric mucosa causing stomach injury and to a lesser extent platelet aggregation causing subclinical bleeding tendency.14 The importance of COX-2 (which is an enzyme that promotes swelling and inflammation, thus increases the supply of cells involved in bone formation and implant osseointegration) was addresses in some studies.17,18 It was shown that mice with deficiency in COX-2 had very minimal amount of bone formation around implants when compared with the control.19
Another indirect adverse effect of ibuprofen on osseointegration of dental implants is that it may lead to stomach disturbances, which may necessitate the use of proton pump inhibitors. These drugs was also found to impair osseointegration of dental implants.20
Level of salivary cortisol was found to be a reliable and accurate measure of stress and anxiety for more than half a century.21,22 It was used in dentistry to measure the level of anxiety during dental treatment.23,24
To our knowledge, no other study has investigated the effect of paracetamol on stress reduction in implant surgeries. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the ability of paracetamol to lower stress and anxiety when compared with ibuprofen during and after a minimally traumatic computer guided flapless implant surgery with immediate loading protocol using one-piece dental implant.
