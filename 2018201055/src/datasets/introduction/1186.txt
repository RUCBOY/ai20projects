Despite a long evolution of additive manufacturing (AM), starting from the first patent in 1971 [1], 3-D printing technology has only recently exploded in popularity due to the radical decreases in costs brought on by the introduction of the self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) 3-D printer [[2], [3], [4]]. With the generalized material extrusion printing process called fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology gaining prominence in the field with the expiration of fused deposition modeling (FDM) patents, FFF now dominates the 3-D printing market for printers in use [5]. Making AM accessible to the masses of consumers has enabled the emergence of a distributed manufacturing paradigm [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]], where 3-D printing can be used to manufacture open source products for the consumer and by the consumer directly for less (in many cases more than an order of magnitude less) money than purchasing of mass-manufactured proprietary products [10,[15], [16], [17], [18]]. The downloaded substitution values [19,20] for digital manufacturing with AM of even sophisticated high-end products [[21], [22], [23], [24]] provides a high return on investment [25]. In addition, there is some evidence that AM distributed manufacturing reduces the impact on the environment [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. However, both the economics and environmental impact of distributed manufacturing is heavily impacted by success rate. Early work on self-built RepRaps estimated a 20 % failure rate [9] and more recent values of about 10 % [31], which is in the range (1–20 %) of recent polling of the Reddit r/3Dprinting community [32].
Although the cost of printing with an FFF-based 3-D printer is trivial compared to the other AM techniques, printing errors are substantial enough to impact the economic and environmental merits of the approach. To this end, several studies and techniques have been attempted to reduce failure rates. Nuchitprasitchai et al. [33] were able to detect the “blocked nozzle” and “incomplete print” failures for six different objects in five colors. The printed objects have been tested in a single- and double-camera experiments to determine critical 5% deviations in shape and size at every 50th layer. In the subsequent work [34], the authors used three pairs of cameras 120 degrees apart to reconstruct the 3-D surface points of the printed objects at every 30th layer to detect critical 10 % size deviations. The method was tested on several gear-shaped objects, however, due to the complexity of the design and significant computational load, the processing time of one layer can reach 8.5 min [34]. Garanger et al. [35] implemented a closed-loop control system for a certain additive manufacturing process to reach the acceptable stiffness for leaf spring-like objects, however, the system requires mechanical measurements and does not cover a wide range of 3-D printed products, which reduces the versatility of the method and the possibility of its scaling. Delli and Chang [36] proposed a binary (failed/not failed) 3-D printing error classification approach based on a supervised machine learning technique, where the quality check is being performed at critical stages during the printing process. The considered method does not allow classification of detected defects and is also applicable only for supervised printing, where an ideal print sample is available at each control point [36]. Fastowicz and Okarma [37] developed a quality assessment method based on texture analysis using the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix [[38], [39], [40]] and selected Haralick features [41], which allows determining the degree of homogeneity of the printed areas. In [42], Cummings et al., developed a closed-loop control framework that detects and corrects filament bonding failures by using the ultrasonic sensor and manipulating the print bed temperature during the printing process. Rao et al. [43] developed a heterogeneous sensor framework for real-time surface roughness analysis based on such printing parameters as extruder temperature, layer thickness on build quality, and feed to flow ratio. Jin et al. [44] introduced a system of automatic correction of extrusion defects based on machine learning. The method, however, assumes the presence of a large image database (the order of hundreds of thousands) and performs the analysis of only rectangular print fragments for over- and under extrusion [44]. He et al. [45] developed a layer-wise vision-based system for monitoring the external geometric profile of FFF fabricated parts. This method covers simple geometric shapes and does not take into account the internal structure of the printed layers. Finally, the authors of “The Spaghetti Detective” project [46] utilize the webcam to detect critical “spaghetti” failures based on machine learning techniques. This method allows stopping the printing process and notifying the user in case of fatal errors such as model detachment and nozzle positioning failure. However, this does not cover a wide range of possible malfunctions and does not allow implementing any correction algorithms.
In the more mature areas of AM with higher-priced materials and 3-D printers, various methods of quality control have been instituted to minimize print failure. Scime and Beth [47] introduced an in-situ anomaly detection approach based on the unsupervised machine learning technique for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing. The developed method [47] determines the possible causes for partial fusion failures and provides potential strategies to build quality enhancement in the future. Xiong et al. [48] developed a camera-based system in gas metal arc welding to monitor and control the distance between the nozzle and the top surface by compensating such parameters as the deposition rate and working flat level. Nassar et al. [49] developed a temperature-based inner layer control strategy and analyzed its effects on the hardness and microstructure of the metal printed component. In both [48] and [49], the authors developed closed-loop control capabilities, but the methods, however, focus on microscopic properties without considering the global macrostructure of the object being built. Okaro et al. [50] introduced a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm based on large sets of photodiode data for automatic “faulty” and “acceptable” tensile strength assessment in laser power bed fusion additive manufacturing. Garanger et al. [51] suggested a number of semantic rules within 3-D printing files, which provide desired specifications and, based on material properties, real-time topology and finite element analysis, generate feedback laws for the control system. Yuan et al. [52] developed a two-step machine learning approach to real-time laser track welds assessment in LPBF processes. Sitthi-Amorn et al. [53] introduced a layer-wise correction technique for multi-material 3-D printing. Razaviarab et al. [54] proposed a closed-loop machine learning algorithm to detect layer defects in metal printing.
The key point of the previous works is addressing a limited number of specific cases of local defects without taking into account the global parameters of the printed parts (such as full-scale shift or deformation, deviation of the dimensions of the parts from the calculated ones, etc.). Most of the methods described also do not imply an on-the-fly algorithm for compensating, correcting or eliminating manufacturing failures.
In order to mature the FFF-based 3-D printing quality control to reach that of the more expensive AM technologies, this study presents and tests a free and open source software algorithm and hardware structure based on computer vision, which allows layer-wise analysis of 3-D printing processes to segment and track manufacturing errors, and repairing procedures to generate appropriate printer actions during fabrication. These repair-based actions are designed to minimize the waste of printing material and printing time caused by erroneous printing attempts. The approach is based on monocular multiple-stage image processing that monitors the external shape of the printed object and internal structure of the layers. One camera does not provide the analysis of the entire surface of the printed part, however, it has significant advantages in ease of use and allows detecting the majority of failures in most common printing shapes, while the use of multiple cameras greatly complicates the calibration process and increases the computational load, which may inhibit the large-scale use of such a system in the future. The developed framework analyzes both global (deformation of overall dimensions) and local (deformation of filling) deviations of print modes, it restores the level of scale and displacement of the deformed layer and introduces a potential opportunity of repairing internal defects in printed layers. This will save material and time. The runtime as a function of layers is quantified and the results are discussed.
