Adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a well-accepted quality indicator of screening colonoscopy and is defined as the proportion of patients who have one or more adenoma detected while undergoing screening colonoscopy. Higher ADR by standard colonoscopy (SC) has shown to decrease CRC incidence thereby improving CRC related morbidity and mortality [1].
A growing body of evidence has evaluated the use of artificial intelligence (AI) known as computer-vision in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of health related conditions based on medical imaging [2–7]. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is a type of deep machine learning algorithm that uses convolutions of the input image in order to extract the most relevant information that helps to classify the image into different entities. Based on the accumulated data features, a deep CNN can diagnose newly acquired clinical images prospectively [8–9]. Recent evidence has evaluated the use of CNN based algorithms in real-time colonoscopy to improve ADR by means of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [2–7].
In this analysis, we aim to quantitatively appraise the current reported data on ADR during colonoscopy in presence of CNN based computer aided detection (CADe) from prospectively conducted parallel RCTs in real life scenario.
