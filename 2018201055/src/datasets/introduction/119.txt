Medical ultrasound has been frequently used in disease diagnosis as well as interventional imaging guidance and therapy monitoring, because of its real-time capability, low cost, and wide availability. A transducer transmits ultrasound waves into biological tissue, which interacts with the tissue, and receives the backscattered waves, processed and beamformed as radiofrequency (RF) signals. Conventional B-mode ultrasound utilizes only the envelope amplitude information of backscattered RF signals, and uses log-compression which makes B-mode ultrasound a qualitative modality. Acoustically, biological tissues can be modelled as a collection of ultrasonic scatterers [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Ultrasound tissue characterization involves investigating the interaction of ultrasound waves with tissue microstructures (scatterers) by analyzing quantitatively backscattered RF signals for disease diagnosis and therapy monitoring, known as quantitative ultrasound (QUS) techniques. QUS extracts quantified information associated with tissue microstructure characteristics from RF signals [10], including attenuation coefficient, speed of sound, backscatter coefficient, scatterer size, Lizzi-Feleppa spectral parameters, envelope statistics, scatterer properties, and elastography. QUS has become a complement to conventional B-mode ultrasound.
Ultrasound backscatter envelope statistics are an important group of QUS techniques [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Among them, two techniques have been commercialized [17]: acoustic structure quantification (ASQ) that measures the difference between the envelope statistics and the Rayleigh distribution, and ultrasound Nakagami imaging based on the Nakagami distribution [12]. The homodyned K (HK) distribution [18], [19] is another generalized model for describing envelope statistics whose parameters have a physical meaning. The Nakagami distribution has one less parameter than the HK distribution [13], and the Nakagami distribution is an approximation of the HK distribution [20]. However, there is analytical complexity in estimating the HK model parameters. Dutt and Greenleaf [21] initiated the estimation of HK parameters for ultrasound imaging, with an estimator based on the even moments of envelope signals. In recent years, improved methods for estimating HK parameters have been proposed, which are based on the integer or fractional moments of envelope signals. These include (i) the estimator that uses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the skewness based on the first three integer moments of the intensity (i.e., the square of the envelope), which is termed “FTM” [22], (ii) the level-curve estimator that uses the SNR, skewness, and kurtosis based on fractional moments of the envelope, which is termed “RSK” [23], [24], and (iii) the estimator that uses the first moment of the intensity and two log-moments (i.e., X- and U-statistics), which is termed “XU” [25]. In addition, HK parameters can be estimated using a maximum likelihood estimation method [26].
Table 1 summarizes ultrasound tissue characterization with the HK model. The HK model parameters have been used to quantitatively characterize phantoms [27], [28], [29], [30], porcine myocardium in vivo [31], mice breast cancer in vivo [32], human breast lesions in vivo [33]-[35], response of advanced human breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in vivo [36], cancerous human lymph nodes ex vivo [37], porcine red blood cell aggregation ex vivo [38], human carotid artery plaque in vivo [39], human skin ulcer ex vivo [40], lateral epicondylosis of human elbows in vivo [41], nonalcoholic steatohepatitis of rats in vivo [42], and hepatic steatosis of rabbit livers ex vivo [43], duct livers in vivo [44], rat livers in vivo [45], [46], and human livers in vivo [47], [48]. For these applications, the mostly used estimators are RSK and XU (Table 1). Next, there is a need to develop a new parameter estimation method of the HK distribution that is accurate, fast, and simple to implement.Table 1.

Estimating the parameters of the HK distribution from ultrasound backscattered RF signals is an inverse problem and can be formulated as a function approximation problem, to which artificial neural networks (ANNs) are well suited [49]. Inspired by previous works on parameter estimation of the K distribution using ANNs [49], [50], [51], we hypothesized that ANNs might also be used for estimating the HK parameters. In this study, we proposed an ANN based estimator of the HK distribution. The proposed ANN estimator inherited the advantages of RSK and XU estimators through extracting five feature parameters from backscatter envelope signals as the input of the ANN: SNR, skewness, kurtosis, as well as X- and U-statistics. Computer simulation and clinical experiments were performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed ANN estimator.
