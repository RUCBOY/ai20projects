Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important cereal that has been broadly cultivated worldwide for human consumption and animal feed. However, maize kernels are susceptible to infection by toxigenic fungi, especially Fusarium spp. and Aspergillus spp. in pre- and post-harvest conditions [1]. The proliferation of fungi in maize not only leads to a reduction in yield and quality with significant economic losses, but also results in the production of carcinogenic secondary metabolites, named mycotoxins, which impose a serious threat to human and animal health [2]. Traditionally, the presence of fungi has been identified using microbiological or immunological methods in laboratory, such as plate-counting, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence, nucleic acid-based tests (NAT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. Although reliable, sensitive and specific, they are generally time-consuming, labor-intensive and technically complicated. Hence, rapid and cost-effective methods are still highly desirable when a large number of grains need to be screened at grain handling facilities.
Among easy-to-use and low-cost alternative methods, visible/near infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy and computer vision have attracted a lot of interests recently, mainly because of their rapidity, simplicity and potential for on-line analysis [7]. Vis/NIR spectroscopy can record vibrational response of chemical bonds such as OH, CH and NH in grain that is related to its internal components [8]. While computer vision, which simulates human visual system, can evaluate grain quality according to external attributes, such as color, size and surface texture [9]. Considering the accurate determination of mycotoxins is very challenging, because they are often present in quite small quantities. It will be an alternative way to identify fungal infection in grains at early stage to prevent mycotoxins contamination. Currently, both spectroscopy and image methods have been used for rapid detection of hazardous Fusarium spp., Aspergillus spp., Diplodia spp. or other fungal infection in maize [10,11], wheat [12,13], rice [14,15] and other grains [16,17].
However, the deterioration of grains caused by fungal contamination is accompanied by complicated changes in both internal compositions (carbohydrate, protein, fat, etc.) and external attributes (color, shape, texture, etc.). Vis/NIR spectroscopy is generally based on point-scanning and cannot provide much useful information about external characteristics of samples. Meanwhile, computer vision is hard to detect internal defect or lower level of infection where clear physiological change is not obvious. Since single information can only describe one of the aspects, it is recommended that combination of spectroscopy and image will provide more complete and complementary information [18]. Some authors have already combined the two techniques for quality prediction of meat, fish, fruit and the results were generally improved [[19], [20], [21]]. However, no such fusion was investigated in grains. In addition, the vast majority of previous works still remains in static detection, lacking the speed requirement for on-line detection. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an emerging method that integrates traditional imaging and spectroscopy to provide both spatial and spectral information about an object, which allows the characterization of the object more reliably. It has already been applied for detection of Aspergillus spp., Fusarium spp. and Penicillium spp. infection in maize and other grains [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. But it is still not very suitable for on-line detection due to huge data volumes and considerable processing time [26].
Therefore, the objective of this present study was to investigate the integration of Vis/NIR spectroscopy and computer vision for on-line detection of hazardous Aspergillus spp. and Fusarium spp. infection in maize. The intention is to take advantage of the complementarity of two types of techniques, one for local evaluation of internal chemical property, the other for global assessment of external physical property, and to improve detection accuracy. In addition, it is supported by both theoretical research and practical experience that appropriate feature selection from original data is necessary to improve modeling efficiency and prediction accuracy [27]. Thus, the specific objectives were: 1) to study the correlation between spectral/image information and fungal infection in maize in on-line detection; 2) to extract the representative features from raw spectral and image data for further modeling; 3) to fuse spectral and image features for more effective qualitative and quantitative prediction of fungal contamination in maize.
