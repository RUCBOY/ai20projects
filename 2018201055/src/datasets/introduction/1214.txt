Computation of delay bound of teletraffic (traffic for short) plays a role in computer science for quality of service in computer communications or cyber physical systems, see for examples [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. This paper will contribute four fractal delay bounds of traffic, which are tighter than conventional non-fractal ones.
Denote by x(t) instantaneous arrival traffic time series. The unit of x(t) is byte when it is taken as the packet size of a packet arriving at time t. Its size is restricted by (1)0≤xmin≤x(t)≤xmax,where xmin and xmax are specified by protocols and IEEE standard without technical reason. For instance, without considering the Ethernet preamble, header or CRC, the Ethernet protocol forces all packets to have xmin=64 bytes and xmax=1518 bytes [19].
Usually, a server S serves a number of connections within a time interval [0, t]. Let xj(t) be the instantaneous arrival traffic from connection j (j=1, 2, …, J). Denote by Xj(t) the accumulated amount of xj(t) in [0, t]. It is given by (2)Xj(t)=∫0txj(u)du.Generally, S serves Xj(t) on an interval-by-interval basis for j=1, 2, …, J [19].
Let Yj(t) be departure traffic of S that is driven by Xj(t). Let dj(t) be delay that Xj(t) suffers from S. Then, (3)Yj(t)=Xj(t−dj(t)).Since dj(t) is random [20], [21], [22] and Xj(t) is of fractal [11], [23], delay computation is a difficulty.
In order to overcome the difficulty, people pay attention to finding a bound of dj(t) for j=1, 2, …, J within [0, t] instead of obtaining instantaneous dj(t) for each connection. Denote by dm a bound of dj(t) for all connections (j=1, 2, …, J) within [0, t]. Then, if we can assure dj(t) ≤
dm for j=1, 2, …, J in [0, t], the quality of service of Xj(t) in delay for all connections (j=1, 2, …, J) within [0, t] can be guaranteed. Thus, the research issue of delay bound is essential in computer communications.
Note dm relates to a service time length of S that serves Xj(t) while the service time length relates to the size of Xj(t). Since traffic is a fractal time series, Xj(t) is random. Thus, instead of directly computing Xj(t), people concern with a bound of Xj(t) for j=1, 2, …, J in [0, t]. Denote by Xm a bound of Xj(t) for all connections (j=1, 2, …, J) within [0, t]. Then, as long as S serves Xm with a guaranteed dm in [0, t], it is assured for S to serve Xj(t) with a guaranteed dm for any connection j=1, 2, …, J within [0, t]. This research way, shortly speaking, implies that one has to research arrival traffic bound in order to study traffic delay bound, according to the theory of network calculus introduced by Cruz [24].
Without losing generality, we omit the subscript j for Xj(t) or dj(t) in what follows. Write the general form of accumulated arrival traffic in [0, t] by (4)X(t)=∫0tx(u)du.The network calculus pays attention to two key properties of traffic [1], [2], [3], [24], [25], [26].
One property of traffic is called burstiness in the field. It is a local property of traffic [24], [25], [26]. Cruz used a symbol σ to characterize burstiness [24]. It is in the form (5)limt→0∫0tx(u)du≤σ,see [1], [2], [3], [11], [12], [13], [14], [24], [25], [26]. The parameter σ measures a local property of traffic because it is obtained under the condition of an interval [0, t] → [0, 0] when t → 0. The other property is long-term average rate. Denote it by ρ [24]. It is given by (6)limt→∞∫0tx(u)dut≤ρ.The parameter ρ characterizes a global property of traffic as it is attained under the condition of [0, t] → [0, ∞] for t →
∞.
Combining (5) with (6) yields an inequality for representing a bound of X(t) in the form (7)∫0tx(u)du=X(t)≤σ+ρt.The above is called (σ, ρ) shaper of traffic. We call it the Cruz model of traffic for the memento of Cruz. The unit of σ is byte × sec while that of ρ byte when x(t) stands for packet size. It is worth noting that two parameters σ and ρ are independent each other.
Let Y(t) be departure traffic from a server S. Let ⊗ be the min-plus convolution operator. Denote by S(t) a service curve of S. Then, (8)X(t)⊗S(t)=YXS(t)≤Y(t),where X(t), S(t), and YSX(t) are nonnegative and increasing in the wide sense [1], [2], [3], [24], [25], [26]. When S(t) is designed such that ( [1], [2], [3], [24], [25], [26]) (9)YXS(t)≤Y(t)=σ+ρ(t−d),where d is delay with the unit sec, one has a delay bound in the form (10)d=d(t)≤σ+ρt−YXS(t)ρ≜dCruz1.We use the subscript Cruz for dCruz1 to imply that it is based on the Cruz model (σ, ρ). Note that dCruz1
≥ 0 due to (9).
The quantity dCruz1 in (10) is irrelevant to the statistics of traffic. That is a significant advantage of network calculus. It implies that delay computation is simple without the statistics of traffic considering. However, the simple computation of delay bound in (10) is at the cost of sacrifice of network resources because arrival traffic bound (7) is loose. The sacrifice of network resources may be such that the theory of network calculus [24] is difficult to be practically applied. Consequently, tighter bounds of X(t) are desired.
In addition to (7), there are 3 probabilistic models in the aspect of bounds of X(t). One is the exponential bound [27], [28]. It is in the form (11)Pr∫0tx(u)du≥σ+ρt≤Ae−vσ,where A and v are constants, and Pr(.) is the probability of ⋅. Clearly, (11) requires v ≥ 0 and A ≥ 0. Let vσ
=
σv. Then, (11) may be rewritten by (12)Pr∫0tx(u)du≥σvv+ρt≤Ae−σv.Since the maximum of Pr(.) is 1 and e−vσ∈[0,1], A has to be 1 in the above. Thus, the above becomes (13)Pr∫0tx(u)du≥σvv+ρt≤e−σv.
Note that the probabilistic bound e−vσ may only be a hypothesis. On this track, therefore, [29] proposed a generalized form of (12). It is given by (14)Pr∫stx(u)du≥σ+ρ(t−s)≤f(σ).The above bounding function f(σ) is only a hypothesis too. Its concrete form lacks.
In the field, [5] presented a probabilistic bound of X(t) in the form (15)PrX(t+τ)−X(t)≤Gδ(τ)>1−δ,where Gδ(τ) is a non-negative function if (15) holds and δ is positive infinitesimal. When τ is small enough, it reflects local property. For large τ, it reflects global property. Nevertheless, a concrete form of Gδ(τ) is lacking.
One thing in common with respect to (11), (14), (15) is that they lack in considering fractal properties of traffic, such as long-range dependence and self-similarity, referring [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63] for fractal time series and traffic. As a matter of fact, finding a tighter bound of X(t) becomes a bottleneck work to study a tighter delay bound of traffic. In this regard, our previous work [54] proposed a fractal bound of X(t), see (21) below, which is tighter than the conventional one (7). Based on that, this paper contributes four fractal traffic delay bounds that are tighter than corresponding non-fractal ones.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Four fractal delay bounds are presented in Section 2. Case study is given in Section 3. Discussions are in Section 4, which is followed by conclusions.
