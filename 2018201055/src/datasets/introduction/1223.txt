Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of various metal additive manufacturing (AM) technologies, from powder bed fusion, directed energy deposition, and binder jetting, to additive friction stir deposition, allowing for net-shaping of a broad range of metals and alloys [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. However, AM also features a variety of defects like pores, internal micro-cracks, and air bubbles that can be present in massive quantities with heterogeneous distributions in the as-printed materials [5,10], and are found to severely degrade the static and fatigue mechanical properties and thus the reliability of the binder jetting parts [11]. The reliability of AM parts critically depends on our quality control capabilities, which allows optimization to reduce or eliminate these defects [12]. This necessitates the development of advanced inspection schemes to enable complete volumetric examination on the macroscopic level as well as comprehensive understandings of the defect characteristics and their global evolution during AM and post-processing.
Understanding defect evolution has been challenging in current AM research [[13], [14], [15]]. The first challenge comes from the acquisition of the defect information throughout macroscopic volumes. A lot of work in AM has focused on local defect characterization using destructive approaches, in which a slice of material is subjected to optical, scanning electron, or transmission electron microscopy [[16], [17], [18]]. These approaches are valid only if the defect information of the slice is representative of the whole material, which is rarely the case for metal AM—the printed material has location-dependent thermal histories that are governed by the component geometries and hatch patterns. In contrast, ultrasonic wave and X-ray allow for non-destructive testing of large volumes; as a result, tools like pulse-echo ultrasonic testing, laser ultrasonic testing, and X-ray computed tomography (XCT) are becoming popular in metal AM inspection [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. Among them, XCT stands out for its superior spatial resolution and deep penetration capability that can provide rich 3D morphological information for all internal defects [[21], [22], [23]]. For example, inspections of porosity in Laser Powder Bed Fusion based additive manufacturing has been widely explored with X-ray CT scan, revealing a rich database of porosity emerged from various mechanisms, such as keyhole collapse [24] and lack of fusion [25]. However, the porosity in LPBF systems has significantly different spatial distributions and morphological properties from the pores in binder jetted materials; the LPBF pores are usually much less densely populated and often clustered, while binder jetting is characterized by large numbers of pores that are universally distributed in the sample [10,11]. New analyzing approaches are needed to efficiently address the challenges associated with binder jetted materials. In addition, high-resolution XCT for large-scale sample is slow; it may take hours to characterize a millimeter-scale volume with micrometer-scale spatial resolution.
The second challenge stems from automated defect registration. While the high-resolution volumetric XCT data provides comprehensive structural information, the size of the dataset is massive (∼ 2–15 GB), involving a large quantity of 3D defects with morphological features spanning over several orders of magnitude. As a result, defect identification and characterization need to be automated with 3D morphological analysis algorithms. Some commercial software codes, such as FEI Avizo [26], and free image analysis softwares, such as ImageJ/Fiji [27,28], are able to perform the semi-automated defect analysis for XCT data to provide some useful information of defects, such as porosity fraction, pore area/volume size, position, etc. in 2D slices [27] or 3D volume [26]. These pre-defined parameters, however, are not optimal to characterize the pores morphological features in binder jetted samples, such as extrusion and necking. This limits the capability for quantitative defect categorization and dynamic evolution analysis. More comprehensive and reliable morphological characterization approaches tailored for the binder jetting are needed. Recently, there has been great interest in developing computer vision based automated inspection [14,[29], [30], [31]]; in particular, deep learning approaches have enabled example-based rather than conventional rule-based algorithms [32,33]. Progress in this regard will facilitate automated 3D analysis approaches for advanced inspection in metal AM.
The third challenge lies in efficient data analysis of defects with complex shapes, where quantification of the morphology is essential to understand the global defect evolution during AM and post-processing. Currently, the defect information in AM is typically represented by a single metric, porosity, which is the volume fraction of pores [[34], [35], [36]]. The porosity can effectively describe the quality of AM parts only if the spatial distribution of pores is uniform and all of the pores are similar in sizes and shapes. It is also well known that porosity alone is insufficient to account for the part properties such as permeability, elastic anisotropy and fracture toughness [37,38], which are highly dependent on the pore shape, orientation, and spatial distribution. Understanding the underlying correlations and trends for large defect datasets is therefore of paramount importance. Such quantification and assessment can be explored through statistical extremes, such as the maximum volume [39,40]. Here, we explore an alternative big data approach to extract evolutional features from the comprehensive dataset of all pores.
Quantitative big data analysis not only provides a holistic picture for global defect evolution during AM or post-processing, but can also give rise to new physical insights beyond vision-based qualitative description [41].
To address all these challenges, the goal of this work is to establish a new inspection approach for AM research in binder jetting materials, which integrates the recent advances in (i) fast tomography, (ii) 3D morphological analysis, and (iii) machine learning-based big data analysis. Leveraging deep learning algorithms, fast tomography is used to collect high-resolution XCT data with only a fraction of the normal data acquisition time [[42], [43], [44], [45]]. Employment of computer vision algorithms allows us to process large sets of X-ray CT data for holistic defect registration and morphology parameterization more reliably and efficiently. The big data analysis enables us to extract the key morphological descriptors of the defects and to categorize the defects into multiple morphological groups based on feature similarity [[46], [47], [48], [49], [50]]. As a result, global defect evolution during AM or post-processing can be quantified, and the most salient changes of defect characteristics can be revealed.
Here, we demonstrate this method by examining the post-processing in binder jetting additive manufacturing, which involves substantial global pore evolution from the green state, to the sintered state, and to the hot isostatic pressed (HIPed) state. We use copper as a model system, which is difficult to print using powder bed fusion and directed energy deposition due to its high reflectivity and high thermal conductivity [51], but are readily printed by binder jetting with good quality—as long as the internal pores can be effectively reduced via post-processing. We show that the approach is effective at detecting and handling the information associated with the large number (∼105) of pores in macroscopic samples, and the pore morphology can be sufficiently represented by a few morphological descriptors based on principal component analysis (PCA). The detected pores are found to be best categorized into four morphological groups, including quasi-spherical pores, small elongated pores with high solidity (a.k.a. convexity, which is used to quantify the amount of concavities of a shape within in its convex boundary. See supplementary information for more information regarding the definition of solidity.), large elongated pores with low solidity, and reticulated defects. By quantifying the evolution of the pore morphological parameters and the weight of each categorized morphological group, we find a reduction in the pore size and eccentricity after sintering and HIP. During sintering, the interconnected reticulated defects break up into smaller pores, while the HIP process is more effective at reducing the size and increasing the solidity of the isolated pores.
