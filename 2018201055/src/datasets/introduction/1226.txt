Hundreds of studies have been conducted in recent decades on the use of computers and educational technology in mathematics education. More than 20 meta-analyses (see Table 1) have been carried out over the past 30 years to examine the effects of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) on mathematics achievement. These reviews generally confirmed that CAI had a positive influence on mathematics performance. However, the overall effect sizes in these meta-analyses varied considerably, from +0.10 to +0.54. Perhaps one of the main reasons for the variations in effect sizes was that each review used different inclusion criteria. For example, the two reviews carried out by Bangert-Drowns, Kulik and Kulik (1985) and Kulik, Kulik and Bangert-Drowns (1985) selected studies using the following criteria: (a) the study should be carried out in an actual classroom setting; (b) the study should have a control group; (c) the attainment test of the study should be fair to the control group; and (d) the attrition rate of the study should be low. The reviews by Slavin and his colleagues (Cheung & Slavin, 2013; Pellegrini, Inns, Lake, & Slavin, 2018; Slavin & Lake, 2008; Slavin, Lake, & Groff, 2009) adopted stricter inclusion criteria, requiring qualifying studies to show initial equivalence between the experimental and the control group, to have a minimum of 12-weeks study duration, and a minimum of two teachers in each group to avoid the possible confounding of teacher effect with treatment effect. They also excluded over-aligned and researcher-made measures, including studies in which students taught on computers were tested on computers which control students did not use. These rigorous standards could partly explain why their overall effect sizes (+0.19 for elementary; +0.10 for secondary) were smaller than those of other reviewers.Table 1.

But we only extracted studies on mathematics.
The vast majority of participants covered in previous reviews were students from Western, developed countries, especially the U.S. and the U.K. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic research syntheses have been made on the impact of educational technology on mathematics achievement in mainland China ∗.The present study hopes to fill this gap, and compare outcomes using similar review standards.
Mathematics education in mainland China has attracted widespread international attention due to the excellent performance of Chinese students in international benchmark assessments. In 2003, Henze, Bos, Voss, and Xu (2004)) randomly sampled 2,547 eighteen-year-old students from four provinces in China, who were tested using assessments from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Three of the four provinces were ranked in first, second, and third place respectively among all participating economies, and the fourth was ranked close behind the leading European countries. In 2009 and 2012, more than 5,000 students in Shanghai participated in each round of the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), and were twice ranked first in Mathematical Literacy (PISA, 2009,2012). However, one must interpret such international comparisons of this kind with care, as they represent only selected portions of a vast country (Carnoy & Rothstein, 2013). Nevertheless, such reports have certainly raised interest in Chinese education.
Mainland China includes rural backwaters as well as modern cities, and it is trying to make rapid progress nationwide. China has a particular focus on applications of technology for mathematics, and numerous studies have evaluated a wide variety of approaches to improving outcomes in this subject. Yet due to the language barrier, the findings of these studies are not widely known outside of China itself, and cannot therefore be compared with Western research.
The overwhelming majority of included studies in previous meta-analyses, perhaps with the single exception of Liao (1998, 2007), were conducted in English-speaking countries. No study has yet reviewed CAI studies in mainland China. The inclusion of data from such studies represents an important addition to the findings of previous studies. Our findings may help us uncover some common characteristics and patterns in the use of educational technology in different countries.
Specifically, the research questions of this meta-analysis are as follows:
1Do Chinese CAI programs perform better than traditional teaching models in terms of improving mathematics achievement in grades 1-12?2What kinds of CAI are most effective for Chinese students in math?3How do the substantive and methodological features of qualifying studies moderate the effects of CAI on math achievement?
1.1. Theoretical FrameworkIn this review, the term “computer-assisted instruction (CAI)” refers to the teaching and learning process supported by computer-based programs or applications. CAI occurs in grades 1-12, both in school or out of school, and its purpose is to improve students’ mathematics achievement, not their computer skills.In the CAI field, Clark (1983) and Kozma (1994)’s “media effects” debate is well known. Clark (1983) argued that “media are mere vehicles that deliver instruction but not influence student achievement any more than the truck that delivers our groceries causes changes in our nutrition”. Kozma (1994) responded by saying that Clark created an “unnecessary schism between medium and method”. Current CAI programs emphasize not only the use of new delivery tools, but also the educational idea behind the media and the integration between new teaching methods and educational technology. For instance, the meta-analysis by Lou, Abrami, and Apollonia (2001)) compared the effect of small group learning with educational technology and that of individual learning with educational technology; the research by Van der Kleij, Feskens, and Eggen (2015)) contrasted the effects of different feedback methods in computer-based learning. However, this research field needs more studies to focus on combinations of pedagogy and educational technology from different perspectives.Mainland China’s experience provides useful information in this respect. On the one hand, the informatization of basic education was a core objective of China’s educational development. In 2001, the PRC’s Ministry of Education began to implement the eighth round of its national curriculum reform. This represented the most systematic and ambitious attempt to transform the basic education curriculum system in mainland China since 1949 (Yin, 2013). The guiding document of the reform clearly stated that foundational educators should energetically promote the application of educational technology in the teaching and learning process, and facilitate the integration of educational technology and subject curriculum (PRC Ministry of Education, 2001). The Compendium of National Medium-and-Long-Term Educational Reform and Development (2010-2020) had a separate chapter for the informatization of education, which emphasized the development and application of educational technology and related resources, and the modernization of instructional method (PRC Ministry of Education, 2010). One of ten strategic tasks proposed by China’s Education Modernization 2035 is to accelerate the educational reform in the information age, which stressed the application of modern technology to the innovation of teaching and learning model (PRC Ministry of Education, 2019).On the other hand, the eighth round of national curriculum reform also pointed out that the process of curriculum implementation needed a fundamental shift, and that an autonomous, exploratory and cooperative teaching and learning model should be strongly advocated (PRC Ministry of Education, 2001; Zhong, Cui, & Zhang, 2001). The reason behind the decision was that the transmitting teaching model had a long history in mainland China, and was still entrenched at all levels of school education. The transmission instructional model is a teacher-centred model in which the teacher’s role is to present and explain knowledge to students in a predetermined order, and students passively receive what teachers teach. The constructivist offers a sharp contrast view to the transmission perspective. The basic tenets of constructivism are that knowledge, instead of being objective and fixed, is personal social, and cultural and that knowledge is actively created by the learner, not passively received from the environment (Arends, 2012; Clements & Battista, 1990).This curriculum reform caused a debate between transmission model and constructivism model in China. Some highly influential scholars considered that transmission and mastery of knowledge and skills remained the basic function of school education (Fan & Zhong, 2005, 2008, Cai, 2005; Wang, 2004). Therefore, some significant compromises were introduced to the revised mathematics curriculum standards (PRC Ministry of Education, 2011, 2017; Shi, Ma, & Liu, 2012). The new standards reemphasized the importance of knowledge and skills transmission.In this context, our review classified CAI with the pedagogy adopted by teachers in the teaching and learning process, because the development of these CAI programs included in this review is not just based on new media, but also espouses a particular view of education, which determines the choice of media, curriculum contents and instructional methods (Mayer & Johnson, 2008; Mayer, 2001; Nathan & Robinson, 2001). We identify three different types of CAI: (a) Inquiry-CAI (I-CAI); (b) Cooperative-CAI (C-CAI); and (c) Transmission-CAI (T-CAI). The following paragraphs discuss the various pedagogies involved in greater detail.Student-centered inquiry learning is considered to be a teaching approach in which meaningful contexts play a central role in both individual and class learning (Calder, 2013). In this approach, students are encouraged to pose questions, issues or inquiries that interest them, and learning is co-constructed (Lazonder & Harmsen, 2016). This often leads to enhanced student ownership, engagement, and understanding. Teachers have to view themselves as both inquirers and facilitators. They should be prepared to take risks and cede some control over content knowledge and processes (Calder, 2013). In the I-CAI model, the hardware and software are used as discovery tools, and students have considerable freedom to manipulate them, whereas they are mostly manipulated by educational technology in T-CAI and S-CAI. A case in point is a study by Liu (2012) that briefly described I-CAI at work. Liu and his students had a math lesson on “inlay” in his trial. At the beginning of the lesson, Liu displayed several inlays of medieval glass to interest his students. He then gave students a webpage named “Jigsaw Lab”, which could simulate the process of flooring. On the webpage, students could floor “their rooms” with different kinds of geometric figures. Next, the teacher posed a series of questions which they planned to solve, such as “Do arbitrary triangles inlay with each other?” Students tried to answer these questions through exploration on the webpage, and exchanged their works and ideas with the teacher and other students. Finally, the teacher summarized their findings and highlighted the most important conclusions.Cooperative learning occurs as students interact with others in groups to reach shared learning goals (Johnson, Johnson, & Stanne, 2000). It is a more teacher-directed and highly structured collaborative approach in which collaboration among students in groups is strongly encouraged and expected. In cooperative learning, students share their thoughts and ideas and respond to each other at the same time. This experience generates shared meaning and understanding in groups. Cooperative learning is in general more effective than individualized learning as students working in group setting can capitalize on the resources and skills of their peers in the learning process (Terwel, Herfs, Mertens, & Perrenet, 1994). The basic approach of C-CAI programs is to take advantage of educational technology to assist students’ cooperative learning. The instructional model used by Yang (2010) offers a representative example. At the beginning of the lesson, the teacher divided students into groups and helped each student or group to make a feasible study plan. Then students used the network to check data and communicated with group members on a social platform. Finally, each group took presentation tools to share their learning outcomes with the teacher and their classmates.The primary aim of transmission teaching is to transmit facts, skills, and values to students. Specifically, this teaching orientation stresses mastery of traditional school subjects through traditional teaching methodologies (Miller & Seller, 1990). Teachers play the role of an explainer or presenter, and deliver the content knowledge to students in a predetermined order specified in the textbook. The content typically follows the sequence of definitions/theorems, facts/properties, techniques, examples, practice examples, word problems, and further practice (Kahn & Kyle, 2002). For T-CAI programs, the main function of computers and educational technology is to increase transmission efficiency. He (2015) offers an instructive example of how T-CAI was carried out in the classroom. When the teacher introduced conic curves to students for the first time, according to the textbook, she needed to cut a circular cone from different angles. This was a difficult thing to do in a real-life situation, so the teacher in the control group usually presented four pictures to students. In contrast, in the experimental group, the teacher could manipulate a plane to cut a circular cone as many times as she liked in an application. The teacher knew that there were a total of four different kinds of conic curve, so she led students to observe these conic curves and explain their concepts and features.Besides considering the three types of CAI already mentioned, this paper also included Supplemental-CAI (S-CAI). The distinction is that S-CAI keeps the regular curriculum intact, and is implemented outside of regular classes, such as during the midday rest or after school. If the three previous CAIs can be regarded as substitutes for the traditional curriculum and instruction, S-CAI should be thought of as a supplement. The meta-analysis by Lauer et al. (2006) affirmed the positive effect of out-of-school-time programs on student achievement. The study carried out by Lai, Luo, Zhang, Huang, and Rozelle (2015)) showed how a typical S-CAI program worked in mainland China. In the intervention group, there were no math teachers, and only students working in teams with the help of computers. The software consisted of instructional videos and games, aiming at improving basic competencies, and the animated video helped students to review, and the games to practice.
