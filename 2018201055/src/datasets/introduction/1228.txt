Optical three-dimensional (3D) measurement methods [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] are widely used in various fields, such as manufacturing, biomedical system, computer science, security system, archaeological exploration and so on. Optical 3D measurement is an important and valid way to obtain the surface information of object. It has become a significant branch of modern surveying since it has the advantages of non-contact measurement, high measuring accuracy, high speed data acquiring and robustness to noise.
Fourier transform profilometry (FTP) [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] is a 3D measurement method which first proposed by Takeda M and Mutoh K in 1983, it is a method commonly used in single-shot measurement since only one deformed pattern is needed to obtain the surface information of object. It has broad prospect in dynamic 3D measurement. By projecting a sinusoidal grating, FTP can reconstruct the measured object by demodulating the fundamental component extracting from the Fourier spectrum. But the accuracy would be somehow limited due to its filtering operation. Phase measuring profilometry (PMP) [11], [12], [13] is an effective way to reconstruct the object and is widely known for its feature of high accuracy and reliability. In general, PMP uses multiple (≥3) deformed patterns with given shifting phase to retrieve the phase information of the measured object. It can calculate the phase distribution point to point. There is no interference between every pair of adjacent points. It can enhance the noise immunity of profilometry. But it may not be used directly in real-time 3D measurement since three or more deformed patterns are needed. Then, color phase-shifting measurement [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19] has been proposed which only uses single-shot for 3D reconstruction. The color fringe pattern is encoded with three phase shifting sinusoidal fringe patterns into the RGB (red, green, yellow) components which can achieve simultaneous a color grating projecting and a single-shot color deformed pattern capturing. It has the advantages of easy implement and fast speed. But it may bring the overall phase error caused by the color crosstalk and color imbalance. Furthermore, the measuring progress may be complex when the object has a color texture feature. Guan et al. [20] established a composite structured pattern which combining multiple patterns into a single-shot frame projection. Each phase-shifting sinusoidal fringe pattern is modulated into corresponding orthogonal sinusoidal fringe patterns with different frequencies. Then the 3D shape of object can be reconstructed with the deformed sinusoidal deformed patterns demodulated from the captured deformed composite pattern. This method can overcome the limitation of color phase-shifting measurement and realize real-time or on-line measurement. But in the composite structure pattern, it contains three modulating fringe patterns and three phase-shifting sinusoidal fringe patterns [21]. That is to say, at least six fringe patterns share at most 256 gray levels that the commonly used digital projector can project. So the dynamical range may be limited to some extent. Recently, our research group established a real-time 3D measurement method based on computer-generated moiré profilometry (CGMP) [22]. It has potential for high speed 3D shape measurement for the feature that only one sinusoidal deformed fringe pattern is needed. In this paper, a new computer-generated moiré profilometry based on orthogonal modulated computer-generated moiré profilometry (OMCGMP) is proposed. Different from CGMP, the projected grating is not sinusoidal but composite which contains two sinusoidal fringe patterns with π phase difference modulated by two other orthogonal sinusoidal fringe patterns with different frequencies. The composite structure pattern contains only four fringe patterns sharing 256 gray levels rather than six or more fringe patterns of composite pattern by PMP. The two moiré fringes used for 3D reconstruction can be extracted from the captured deformed composite pattern. It can realize real-time acquisition because of its single-shot feature. After background operation processing, the measuring result can maintain its continuity and realize real-time capability. So it has potential in real-time or online measurements [23], [24], [25].
