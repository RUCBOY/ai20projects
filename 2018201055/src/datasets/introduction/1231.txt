In modern optical manufacturing technologies, computer-controlled optical surfacing (CCOS) [1], [2] technology by different kinds of lap tools still plays a significant role in high-precision aspherical optics, even though some deterministic techniques like Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF) [3], [4], [5] or Ion Beam Figuring (IBF) [6], [7], [8], [9] are widely applied. The lap tools in CCOS are different from MRF or IBF, and one of the differences is that the tool paths of laps are always limited inside the optical surface; that is, the lap tool cannot move to the very edge of the optical surface to avoid the danger of the laps turning over [10]. This limitation of the tool path, by restricting the convolution in the dwell-time algorithm, usually causes a type of mid-spatial-frequency surface error, especially when a large lap is used to figure the optics. The mid-spatial-frequency residual surface error is a significant obstacle to opticians involved in further improving the precision of optics. Moreover, in many cases, although the peak-to-valley (PV), root mean square (RMS), and roughness meet the requirements, the mid-spatial-frequency surface error reduces the imaging quality in an optical system. Forbes [11] has observed never-ending struggles with mid-spatial frequencies.
In CCOS, the use of different-sized grinding or polishing laps in manufacturing optics is a routine practice [12], [1], [13]. When small laps are predominantly used to correct the surface error, the time consumption will be increased. In contrast, when large laps are predominantly used, the mid-spatial-frequency results from tool-path limitation become one of the key causes that restrict the accuracy of optics. Therefore, to restrain the mid-spatial-frequency surface error as well as ensure a high manufacturing efficiency, an optimized strategy is developed in this study.
First, the phenomenon and influence of the incomplete convolution in the dwell-time algorithm are analyzed. Then, the complete convolution in the dwell-time algorithm and an optimized strategy to use different-sized laps are introduced in detail. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to validate the methods and strategy developed in this article.
