An epidemic started in December 2019 from Wuhan, China, where infected people suffered from pneumonia-like symptoms which later spread over more than 200 countries world-wide. The root cause of infection was found to be a novel virus that bore structural similarities with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related Coronaviruses, hence named as SARS-CoV-2 (Bogoch et al., 2020; Hui et al., 2020; Paules et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020). It's the seventh Coronavirus that has been isolated from humans and the third one to cause a severe infection leading to a global pandemic (Munster et al., 2020). The virus causes contagious disease which is termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. The virus can be spread through common means such as air droplets and personal contacts etc. By the first week of January 2020, a total 4 cases were found to be positive with 7 critically ill and one death. But the number increased at a logarithmic scale making it an uncontrolled pandemic. Presently, more than 2 million positive cases are reported globally with more than 0.12 million deaths (Zhao et al., 2020). Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS-CoV are notorious for their fatality rates and have caused 36% and 10% deaths, respectively. However, despite belonging to same family, currently SARS-CoV-2 has a fatality rate of 2% but it is prone to vary in future (Baez-Santos et al., 2014; Organization, 2019; Udwadia and Raju, 2020; WHO, 2018; Widagdo et al., 2017).
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus having a genome size of approximately 30,000 bps. The Open Reading Frame (ORF) constitutes two types of proteins, structural (Spike (S) glycoprotein, small Envelope (E) glycoprotein and membrane (M) glycoprotein and nucleocapsid (N) protein) as well nonstructural (NS) protein (i.e. nsp1-16) (Ibrahim et al., 2019). Although all proteins of SARS-CoV-2 have an important role in pathogenesis and replication, S is a promising drug target as it is involved in attachment to the human cell and intracellular entry. It is a homo-trimeric protein that attaches itself to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using its receptor-binding domain and mediates cell entry. The structure of S cleaves at the boundary between its two domains, i.e., S1 and S2. In the prefusion conformation, these subunits remain non-covalently attached. S2 subunit of protein encompasses the fusion machinery while S1 has a crucial role in attachment to the receptor as it contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) (Belouzard et al., 2012; Li et al., 2005a; Walls et al., 2020).
Moreover, Binding immunoglobulin Protein (BiP) also known as Glucose Regulating Protein 78 (GRP78) of humans is the master chaperon protein found on the lumen of the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) also has a role in viral recognition. This Chaperon protien bond to three enzymes Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6), Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 (IRE1) and Protein kinase RNA-like Endoplasmic Reticulum Kinase (PERK) and release them after the accumulation of unfolded proteins (Lee, 2005; Li and Lee, 2006; Quinones et al., 2008; Rao et al., 2004). SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibits protein synthesis and enhance the process of protein refolding. It also brings the cell in a state of stress causing GRP78 to translocate to the cell membrane and expose its Substrate binding Domain (SBD) for virus recognition (Kim et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2002).
Researchers all around the world are endeavoring to find antiviral treatment to cater COVID-19. Several drugs like Favipiravir, Remdesivir, Arbidol, and Chloroquine are under investigational as well as clinical trials to treat it. Arbidol, Ribavirin, Chloroquine phosphate, Lopinavir/Ritonavir, and Immunity-boosting Interferon α (IFN-α) have also been included in the updated guidelines as therapy for COVID-19 by National Health Commission (NHC) of China. However, so far, no drug has been approved by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Dong et al., 2020). Computer-aided drug design project saves the cost and labor to test all the compounds in the lab and help in the screening of potent ligands/inhibitor that can target the majority of strains (Kapetanovic, 2008). Hence, the current study is aimed to explore drugs against S of SARS-CoV-2 using in silico pharmacophore modelling approach and virtual screening of lead compounds.
