Antibiotic resistance is a serious global health problem. Over the past decade, 50% and 80% of global antibiotic prescriptions have been inappropriately used to treat colds and acute bronchitis, respectively [1], [2]. In 2007, European countries reported 400,000 multidrug-resistant bacterial infections with 25,000 attributable deaths. In the U.S. alone, antibiotic resistance causes more than 2 million infections and 23,000 deaths per year. It was estimated that over 700,000 people died in 2014 as a result of antibiotic resistance globally, and this figure could rise to 10 million by 2050, surpassing cancer as the leading cause of death [3], [4]. Overuse of antibiotics is a major risk factor for antibiotic resistance [5]. According to previous studies, reducing antibiotic prescriptions in primary care settings can effectively reduce inappropriate antibiotic use, thus reducing the risk of drug resistance [6], [7].
Previous attempts to reduce antibiotic prescriptions were based on interventions involving email feedback [8], [9], expert audit and education [10], [11], [12], [13], online feedback [14], personalized prescription feedback data [15] and automated alarm feedback [16], [17]. These methods often make the physicians feel that they are being supervised, which elicits negative emotions and leads to negative results [9], [13].
In contrast to the rapid economic development in China, the quality of primary care is still limited. Overuse of antibiotics is one of the serious problems amidst antibiotic stewardship difficulties, especially in primary care settings [2], [18], [19]. Paperless prescription systems based on computer networks have spread to primary care institutions of China. These factors prompted us to consider the effectiveness, acceptability and sustainability of a novel feedback intervention and justified us to design an automated, confidential feedback system that also provides precautions and contraindications of each antibiotic prescribed.
The aim of this study was to develop a computerized feedback system and to investigate the effectiveness of this intervention on the antibiotic prescription rates among primary care physicians.
