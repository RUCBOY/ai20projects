Metasurfaces have gained growing development in recent years because they are a kind of artificially engineered materials whose optical properties arise primarily from their structures rather than the characteristics of their constituents. By artificially adjusting metasurfaces to regulate the electromagnetic properties at the subwavelength scale, metasurfaces can break material limitations to precisely modify the wavefront of light via the amplitude, phase, and polarization. Metasurfaces generally consists of a single layer of meta-atoms which can introduce the discontinuous phase in the intersurface, and this phase discontinuity can achieve a negative refractive index [1], [2], cloaking [3], [4], [5], and imaging [6], [7], [8] and so on. For instance, researchers designed C-shape [9], [10], [11] and V-shape [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] structures, and changed the size and appearance of these meta-atoms to achieve ultrathin metalenses [10], [17], [18], the spin Hall effect of light [19], [20], [21], [22], and optical holography [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Among these, the shape, size, and rotation angle of the unit cell of the metalens can be modified to achieve different functions such as anomalous reflection and optical rotation in single metalens [9], [16], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Conventional optical systems need to accumulate optical path length to control the wavefront and achieve the desired function. However, the metalens allows optics to be highly integrated, facilitating future integrated optical structures.
As one of the metalenses, multifocal metalenses, which allows the incident beam to focus at different positions along the direction of light beam propagation, has been used in the field of imaging systems, and optical communications [11], [32], [33]. In general, the classic design strategy of a multifocal metalens is to calculate the single focal metalens using the phase distribution formula, and then arrange and combine the single focal metalenses to form a focal plane array (FPAs) to achieve the multi-focusing function, but this device is relatively large in size and complicated in design [9], [34], [35], [36], [37]. He et al. used the Yang-Gu amplitude-phase retrieval algorithm to obtain the phase distribution on the metasurface. Through multiple iterative calculations on the metasurface and the focusing surface, the optimal solution of the phase distribution of multiple point light sources on the metasurface was obtained, and a good multipoint focus effect was received [10], but the amount of calculation is large, and the use of 8 C-shaped unit cell increases the discontinuity of the phase gradient. Using those methods for multifocal metalenses limited with the low focusing efficiency, inflexible design, complicated and tedious design process, and high requirements for manufacturing processes and assembly. In order to overcome this problem, we have used computer-generated holography (CGH) technology to perform all metalenses phase distribution and design of multifocal metalenses. The CGH method has advantages, such as improving the focusing efficiency of spots, flexibility of the metalens design, simplified design process of multifocal metalens, and fast access of metasurface phase distribution et. al.
In this article, we design a transmissive metalens by exploring the CGH method and all-dielectric material. Phase matching of the unit structure achieved by using the Pancharatnam-Berry (P–B) phase [38]. Recently, the light beam focusing realized through the P–B phase delay of metasurface [39], [40], [41], [42]. Lin et al. used multilayer P-B phase to realize the longitudinal single-wavelength multifocal metalens at 480 nm [39]. Lv et al. utilize subwavelength gratings etched on silver layer and glass substrate to realize multifocal metalens structures at 532 nm [42]. The authors improved the metalens performance by using classic phase distribution formula to get the metalens surface phase. Here, we use the CGH to get the metalens surface phase. Firstly, the focusing effect of a single focal metalens designed by this method over a certain visible range will be discussed. Secondly, we discuss the focusing effect of the designed multifocal metalens in the visible range. The right circular polarization can be split in the longitudinal direction and focused into four focal points. Finally, we propose a multifocal metalens composed of zones utilizing the same unit cell in the region of visible light. Among them, the metalens has excellent focusing efficiency and breaks through the optical diffraction limit. The simulation results show that this metalens has significant potential applications in particles manipulation and high resolution imaging.
