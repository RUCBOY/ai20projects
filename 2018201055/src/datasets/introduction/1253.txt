Bismuth silicon oxides, obtained by crystallisation of the Bi2O3–SiO2 system, such as Bi12SiO20 and Bi4Si3O12, have attracted much interest due to their technological applications [[1], [2], [3]] in medicine, geological exploration, nuclear physics and high energy physics [4,5]. In particular, Bi12SiO20 is used in scintillators and photorefractive materials, in lasers [6,7] and in materials with applications in electrooptics, acoustics, and piezotechnics, where physical properties such as photorefractivity, photoconductivity, optical activity, reflection holography, lensometry, the velocity of ultrasound wave propagation are important [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. Bi4Si3O12 is used as a highly efficient scintillator in gamma ray spectroscopy and high energy physics, and in non-linear optical devices, nuclear medicine, and photorefractive materials [5].
In general, the physical properties observed in both compounds are directly or indirectly influenced by intrinsic or extrinsic defects. Information about defects, including the dopant ions involved, their valence and local symmetry, mechanisms of charge compensation (when necessary), and the predominance of intrinsic defects is essential information that can help explain the material properties and also help to improve and enhance particular properties. Atomistic computer modelling has been shown to be a powerful method for obtaining detailed information about intrinsic and extrinsic defects. Recently, this method has been employed with success in point defect calculations on other sillenite compounds, such as Bi12GeO20 [17,18] and Bi12TiO20 [19], related compounds in the Bi2O3–MeO2 series (where Me ​= ​Ge, Si, Ti and Mn) system [20] and applied in BiVO4 scheelite structure [21].
In this paper, atomistic computer modelling based on lattice energy minimisation is applied to study the defect properties in the bismuth silicate compounds. Additional intrinsic defects formed by electron and hole trapping and antisite defects are considered as well as the more familiar Frenkel and Schottky defects. Extrinsic defects are then considered in a study of doping by a range of rare earth ions where solution energies, solution schemes and solubility limits are obtained.
