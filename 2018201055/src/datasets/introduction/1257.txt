Clinical practice guidelines for the management of knee osteoarthritis (OA) consistently recommend patient education and self-management, exercise therapy, and weight management as core first-line treatments [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. These interventions are effective, low to moderate cost, and have minimal risk of adverse events, making them high-value care options. A range of adjunctive treatment options are also recommended for patients whose symptoms are not optimally alleviated by these first-line treatments and where adjunctive treatments may provide a further therapeutic window for core first-line treatments to be delivered. However, there is less consensus regarding these second-line or adjunctive treatments, as evidenced by variability in recommendations between guidelines, and little guidance is available as to how they should be prioritised.
Given limited resources and increasing demand for healthcare, the prioritisation of potential alternative treatments should be informed, at least in part, by their cost-effectiveness. For a fixed healthcare budget, prioritisation of the most cost-effective treatments provides the greatest possible health gains to the population. To allow meaningful comparison across different health conditions and treatment options, estimation of cost-effectiveness should be based on cost-utility analysis, comparing the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained in the target population with the incremental costs of the intervention [5]. Given the chronic nature of OA, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) should consider a long time horizon, preferably over the lifetime of those receiving treatment.
There is limited or no published cost-effectiveness data for many recommended treatments for OA [4,6,7]. In the absence of primary data on cost-effectiveness, computer simulation modelling can be used to combine available data on treatment effectiveness and adverse events, preferably from randomised controlled trials, with other sources of data on patient trajectories and the healthcare resources required for different treatments, to estimate treatment cost-effectiveness [[8], [9], [10]]. Even where trial-based cost-effectiveness data are available, simulation modelling can extend the analysis beyond the typically limited trial follow-up period and can provide results tailored to a specific policy context (e.g. by adjusting for differing target populations, resource availability, competing treatment pathways, or treatment costs). Simulation modelling is increasingly being used to model the economic impact and cost-effectiveness of interventions across many health conditions [11], including OA [[12], [13], [14], [15]].
The aim of this study was to use a previously validated computer simulation model [12] to estimate the potential lifetime incremental health gains, costs, and cost-effectiveness of recommended adjunctive treatments for knee OA, delivered in addition to recommended core treatments, compared with core treatments only, in the context of the New Zealand (NZ) healthcare system.
