Computer experiments are being widely used in many fields recently, and space-filling designs have been appropriate designs for computer experiments (Fang et al., 2006). A space-filling design is a design that spreads its points in the design region uniformly, where the uniformity can be evaluated by some distance or discrepancy criteria. Based on the effect sparsity principle (Wu and Hamada, 2009), only a few factors are expected to be active in a computer experiment. Therefore, for a high-dimensional design region, it may be more reasonable to consider the space-filling properties in low-dimensional projections (Joseph et al., 2015) and (Sun et al., 2019). There have been fruitful approaches for constructing space-filling designs with good low-dimensional stratifications. Latin hypercube designs (LHDs), proposed by McKay et al. (1979), are of utmost popularity among the space-filling designs. An LHD with n runs possesses n equally spaced levels, which guarantees the maximum stratification in one dimension. Owen (1992) proposed randomized orthogonal arrays (OAs), which can be used to generalize LHDs and lattice samplings. Tang (1993) constructed LHDs based on OAs for getting designs with attractive g-dimensional space-filling property for any g no more than t, where t is the strength of the corresponding OAs. Recently, He and Tang (2013) introduced strong orthogonal arrays (SOAs) and Mukerjee et al. (2014) proposed mappable nearly orthogonal arrays (MNOAs), both can be used to construct space-filling designs better than those based on ordinary OAs.
In addition to the space-filling property, the column-orthogonality is also a desirable aspect for designs of computer experiments since it allows uncorrelated estimations of the main effects in linear models and effective factor screening in Gaussian process models. A number of methods have been proposed to construct orthogonal designs (ODs). Some are on the construction of orthogonal LHDs (OLHDs), see e.g., Steinberg and Lin (2006), Bingham et al. (2009), Pang et al. (2009), Sun et al., 2009, Sun et al., 2010, Lin et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2010, Georgiou (2009), Georgiou and Stylianou (2011), Yang and Liu (2012), Yin and Liu (2013), Ai et al. (2012), Georgiou and Efthimiou (2014), Sun and Tang (2017a), Wang et al. (2018) and the references therein. Besides, Liu and Liu (2015) and Zhou and Tang (2019) studied the constructions of column-orthogonal SOAs. Sun and Tang (2017b) provided constructions of ODs with two-dimensional space-filling properties.
In this paper, we introduce a new class of ODs with both two- and three-dimensional space-filling properties, which include OLHDs as special cases. To see the benefits of using such a design, we now provide an illustrative example. For a given run size 81, an OA of 9 levels (with strength 2) can accommodate 10 factors, which can achieve stratifications on 9 × 9 grids in all two dimensions, an OA of 3 levels (with strength 2) can accommodate 40 factors, which can achieve stratifications on 3 × 3 grids in all two dimensions, while an OA of strength 3 with 3 levels can accommodate 10 factors, which can achieve stratifications on 3 × 3 × 3 grids in all three dimensions. The column-orthogonal SOA with 81 runs of strength 2+ constructed in Zhou and Tang (2019) can accommodate 13 factors each of 9 levels, which achieves stratifications on 3 × 9 and 9 × 3 grids in any two dimensions. Now consider the OD constructed in this paper for run size 81, it can accommodate 38 factors each of 9 levels, and guarantee stratifications on 3 × 9 and 9 × 3 grids in 654 out of all 703 (i.e., 93.03%) two dimensions and 3 × 3 grids for all two dimensions. Meanwhile it achieves stratifications on 3 × 3 × 3 grids in 7992 out of all 8436 (i.e., 94.74%) three dimensions. We can see that the OD has competitive space-filling properties while can accommodate more factors, making it a good choice for computer experiments.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces some preliminaries used in this paper. In Section 3, we provide the construction methods and some theoretical results. Section 4 considers the mixed-level case of this kind of ODs when the factors have different numbers of levels. Concluding remarks are provided in Section 5. All proofs are deferred to Appendix A.
