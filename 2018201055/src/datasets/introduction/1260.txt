Building stones used in religious, military, and civil architectural heritage are among the most important building materials that ensure the transfer of immovable cultural assets to the present day, thanks to their strength and physical and mechanical properties. The sustainable preservation of stone monuments, which are part of the cultural heritage, is very important. The weathering processes that occur in these structures over time threaten the transfer of monuments to subsequent generations. The types of weathering must be analyzed, and restoration applications must be planned according to the degree of degradation, in order to overcome this problem [1]. Degradation analysis is very important because the petrographic, textural, physical (porosty, density, water absorption by weight, etc.), and mechanical (uniaxial compressive strength, Schmidt hammer and Leeb hardness, etc.) properties of the rock types (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary) may cause changes derived from atmospheric processes and the differentiation of the degradation types that will develop in the rocks related to this process. Therefore, it is important to determine the lithology of the building stones used in monuments, and, if possible, identify the ancient stone quarry, especially in cases where replacements are to be made [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. Treatments that are unsuitable for the original stone, such as consolidation, patching, and water repellent sealing, may increase the speed of degradation by altering the physical and mechanical properties of the stone [6]. Furthermore, it is important to collect the stone material to be used in replacements and completion applications from the ancient quarry [7,8]. In cases when the ancient quarry cannot be found (for example, having disappeared under anthropic actions such as waste dumping), or sits within a protected area and extraction of new blocks is nearly impossible [9], rocks with properties closest to the original rocks should be used [7,10,11]. In cases when they are not used, the aesthetic properties and appearance of the cultural heritage site may be lost (Fig. 1).Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. An example of structures that have lost their aesthetic properties and appearance as a result of the wrong completion in Konya cultural heritage; a) Kızılören Caravanserai, b) Kuruçeşme caravanserai.
The monuments in the Konya cultural heritage site, shown in Fig. 1, underwent restoration work with incorrect determination of the stone lithology. Upon examination, it was found that the new rocks, which were not similar in texture or color to the original stones, reduced the aesthetic value of the monuments. Additionally, the combination of original and replacement rocks caused technical problems in both monuments due to mismatched physical and mechanical properties, increasing the degree of weathering observed in the original stones.
Historically, different stone lithologies have sometimes been used in buildings in order to improve their aesthetic appearance. Geo-lithological mapping of historical buildings can provide guidance in determining stone types before restoration and in determining the weathering behaviors of different rock types. Generally, lithologies in stone monuments are determined by vision-based in situ methods [[12], [13], [14], [15]]. However, this method may lead to incorrect classification of lithology and improper restoration applications in cases when the restorator who performs the examination is inexperienced, or when no opinion is received from a geo-engineering research team. Furthermore, buildings consisting of different stone materials may lead to errors since they increase the working time for their petrographic determination by in-situ methods. Terrestrial laser scanner or photogrammetry methods have been suggested by many authors to reduce working time in field studies [4,5,5,6,[6], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]. Although both methods have great advantages, orthophoto images must be examined using vision-based methods in the detection of lithology, making data interpretation potentially difficult.
Deep learning (DL), which has been developed in recent years, may be an effective way to overcome these difficulties. DL attempts to imitate the human brain, and is an artificial intelligence application with automatic feature extraction capability [21]. Using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based DL trained by machine learning, highly accurate and precise algorithms can be created for semantic segmentation [22], object detection [23], and instance segmentation [24]. These DL algorithms, which are commonly used in many disciplines, have recently been implemented in studies specific to immovable cultural heritage, leading to significant findings [[25], [26], [27], [28]]. Among these studies, Wang et al. [25] determined the efflorescence and spalling weathering types in historic brick walls with the Faster R–CNN algorithm, and found average precision (AP) values in the range of 0.824–0.996 for the classes. Wang et al. [26] also proposed a two-level algorithm, including Faster R–CNN and Mask R–CNN, to determine damage in historic glazed tiles, and obtained an AP value of 0.975%. Hatır et al. [27] used DL to classify eight different weathering anomalies and fresh rock images common in the historic structures of the Konya region, and determined the weathering types at a very high accuracy rate of 99.4%. Zou et al. [28] developed a Faster R–CNN–based detection model to detect robust and damaged building components in historic buildings, with AP values between 0.9056% and 0.7475%.
The application of the DL method, which is used in areas such as face recognition [29], speech recognition [30], and autonomous driving [31], at cultural heritage sites is quite new and limited. Algorithms developed specifically for historic buildings have potential to lead restoration works, but previous studies have focused only on damage detection in monuments, and not on the determination of traditional building materials. The aim of this study is to eliminate human-induced errors by automatically obtaining a geo-lithological map, which is of key importance in restoration applications of stone heritage, via computer vision. However, mapping wide and high-façade monuments can be complicated since state-of-art DL algorithms such as Single Shot Detector (SSD) [32], You Only Look Once (YOLO) [33], and Faster R–CNN [34] perform target detection with a bounding box. In this study, a method based on Mask R–CNN is proposed to overcome this problem. The proposed method was used to determine the contour data of the stones in the Konya heritage site, and then to apply masks of different colors according to lithology diversity, thus obtaining lithology maps.
