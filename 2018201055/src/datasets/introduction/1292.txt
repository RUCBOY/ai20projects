Patients with bone metastases carry a risk of pathological fractures. [[1], [2], [3]] If a pathological fracture occurs in a weight-bearing bone such as the femur, this leads to an immediate decrease in the patient’s mobility and self-care, and as a result in a reduced quality of life and possibly shortened survival [4,5]. Treatment of bone metastases in intact femurs is, therefore, based on the expected fracture risk [6,7]. Patients with an expected low fracture risk are treated with radiotherapy, usually a single fraction (SF) of 8 Gy, to relieve pain, whereas patients with an expected high fracture risk are considered firstly for preventive stabilizing surgery. In case of an expected high fracture risk, but the patient refuses surgery, radiotherapy in multiple fractions (MF) will be given, with the goal to prevent a pathological fracture by inducing remineralization [[6], [7], [8]].
Currently, fracture risk assessment is based on available imaging such as conventional radiographs and CT scans, on which lesion characteristics like size [7,9,10] and radiographic appearance [7,[9], [10], [11]] are measured. Mirels et al.[11] developed a scoring system that is widely used for fracture risk assessment. This score combines ratings of pain, lesion type, size and location, and runs from 4 to 12. Generally, a patient should be considered for surgery if the Mirels’ score is 9 or higher [11]. However, it is known that this score is very conservative and results in large numbers of overtreatment (positive predictive value (PPV) of 14%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%). As a consequence, patients who would never have developed a fracture during their remaining lifetime undergo surgery [7].
Fracture risk can be assessed by measuring axial cortical involvement of the metastatic lesion on conventional radiographs, [6] which has shown to be more accurate compared to Mirels’ scoring system [7]. Recently, the accuracy of the 30 mm threshold of axial cortical involvement was validated using 100 patients with 110 femoral bone metastases [12]. The negative predictive value (NPV) of the 30 mm threshold was high (96–97%), indicating that the 30 mm threshold was very accurate for ruling out pathological fractures. However, the positive predictive value (PPV) was limited (20–23%), which means that only one of four or five patients who were identified as high risk indeed fractured their femur during follow-up, indicating substantial overtreatment [6,12].
Since actual pathological fractures result in higher morbidity and mortality [4,5] and are associated with longer hospital stays and higher costs [13] compared to prophylactic surgery of impending lesions, surgical overtreatment is generally accepted. However, unnecessary invasive treatments should be prevented as much as possible since this results in additional costs, hospitalisation and a certain risk of complications, especially in cancer patients with often poor general clinical condition and limited life expectancy. Hence, there is still room for improvement and a need to develop a more accurate fracture risk assessment tool.
A patient-specific finite element (FE) computer model based on quantitative CT scans (QCT) is a promising tool for fracture risk assessment. [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]] In a recent cohort study [21], we showed that the fracture risk assessments of the FE models were superior to those of experienced clinicians that assessed fracture risk in a test set-up on digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). A limitation of that study was the poor visibility of the metastases on the DRRs. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to compare fracture risk assessments by FE computer models with fracture risk assessments based on axial cortical involvement on diagnostic radiographs as described in current clinical guidelines for cancer patients with femoral bone metastases.
