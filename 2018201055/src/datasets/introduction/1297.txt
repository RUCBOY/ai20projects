Each year in the Gauteng province of South Africa, approximately 1300 bodies are incinerated without a known identity [1,2]. Identification is not always possible with conventional methods such as DNA comparisons and fingerprints. Therefore, more creative methods, including facial approximation, have been implemented to assist in the identification of unknown persons from their skeletal remains in South Africa. In collaboration with the Victim Identification Centre (VIC) of the South African Police Service (SAPS), the Forensic Anthropology Research Centre (FARC) at the University of Pretoria works toward finding solutions for many of the challenges in the identification of unknown skeletal remains found within the South African population. In particular, attention has been given to the development of South African standards for establishing a biological profile (age, sex, stature, and ancestry) in adults and children; the validation of current research methodologies and improvements of methods used in facial approximation and skull-to-photo superimposition [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. Facial approximation methods are employed to estimate the antemortem appearance of an individual from their skeletal remains, providing information about an individual which can be conveyed to the public. Facial approximation is based on the assumed morphological relationship between the soft- tissue envelope and the underlying skull substrate [7]. Facial approximation is a useful tool in the identification of a corpse that is unrecognizable due to its state of decomposition, soft-tissue mutilation, or incineration, and with no other available evidence for identification [8]. The history and development of facial approximation methodology and its applications have exposed the depth of human variation within and between populations and forms the foundation for the current development of valid and reliable population-specific standards. However, prior to approximating a face from the cranial substrate, the practitioner needs information as to the individual’s biological profile, which includes estimations of ancestry, sex, age, and stature. Assortative mating among South African groups certainly strengthened the already notable biological variation in the country and engendered the perpetuation of skeletal variation within the population such that forensic anthropologists are able to classify an unknown into one of the three main socially identified groups: black, “coloured”, or white South Africans [2]. Currently, the facial approximation division of the SAPS uses facial sculpting with modeling software to perform 3D manual approximation of faces following the estimation of the biological profile (sex, age, and ancestry) by anthropologists at the FARC, University of Pretoria. The facial approximation process involves the 3D surface scanning of the target skull (unidentified skull) with a Metrascan 210, a 3D surface of the target skull, which is transposed onto Freeform modeling software, following the manual application of soft-tissue thicknesses at specific craniometrics points using a 3D stylus. Facial features are adjusted, using the same process, on the skull according to North American databases of soft tissue thicknesses derived from cadaver studies. After the final touches by the forensic artists, the final 3D facial approximation is printed and presented to the family for possible recognition. The main critiques of these current facial approximation techniques are the inherent subjectivity in manual methods, the references used, the non-consideration of population specificities, the lack of standardization, and the poor correlations between bony facial structures and soft-tissue, which limit the objectivity and the accuracy of the estimation.
The scientific community in the field of facial approximation recognized that manual approximation methods require a high degree of anatomical and sculptural expertise and remain difficult and subjective in practice. The manual 3D facial approximation technique used by the VIC in South Africa relies on the expertise of a forensic artist to manipulate a 3D stylus. Therefore, the interpretations of two different forensic artists from the same skull can result in the creation of two substantially different faces [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Furthermore, manual approximations are time-consuming and are often limited to a single approximation. Today, traditional 2D or 3D manual techniques of facial approximation are considered unsuitable for application to the judicial system, which requires precision, reliability, and knowledge of possible quantization errors [12]. The reliability of the facial approximation methods used by the VIC in South Africa is further challenged by the available reference sample. The use of cadavers for recording soft-tissue thicknesses has been extensively criticized in recent craniofacial identification literature with poor relationships having been reported between cadaver-based and in vivo measurements on account of tissue deformation from post-mortem changes [14] namely dehydration and shrinkage as well as swelling with the onset of putrefaction [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. In addition, the utilization of guidelines derived from populations other than South Africans is also problematic. The non-consideration of South African standards, taking into account the population specificities, in current facial features approximation techniques such as for the approximation of the nose, limits the objectivity and the accuracy of the approximation, and by extension, the success of the recognition. Following the literature, facial features have been determined to be essential for perceiving and remembering faces [[23], [24], [25]]. The nose is of particular interest as it is a prominent feature, displaying much variation, and therefore, its approximation could be invaluable in the identification of an unknown person. The nose is an important feature to accurately predict in facial recognition, especially in profile view and in a three-quarter view [23]. The morphology of the nose is often manually approximated from the shape and size of the nasal aperture, represented by the position of the pronasale, subnasale, and alare landmarks [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. These nasal profile prediction methods are time- consuming, often limited to a single approximation, and has been demonstrated to be highly varied and subjective, rendering their applications useless in a court of law [32]. In South Africa, a new approach is needed to address the reliability and validity of facial approximation, particularly with regard to its overall accuracy and population specificity.
To accurately assess the structural and functional coherence of correlations between bony facial structures and facial soft-tissue, a definition of a biologically meaningful region of interest, not limited to the nasal aperture and the nasal bones, for the approximation of the nose, is proposed in this study. During craniofacial development, from birth to death, the morphology of the nose is influenced by the remodeling of the underlying skeletal structure [33], emphasizing the fact that the components of the nose cannot be considered as independent elements of the craniofacial skeleton. In addition, in nasal approximation, a biologically meaningful region of interest is rarely considered. A biologically meaningful region of interest is defined as a skeletal region which demonstrates substantial shape variation, impacting on the external morphology, and is influenced by factors such as sex, age, and ancestry. In the scientific literature, it has been demonstrated that the growth and development of the human craniofacial skeleton results from the interdependence of its different components, which are influenced by multifactorial processes involving hormonal, genetic, and epigenetic factors such as ancestry, sex, age and external stimuli [[34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]]. According to the literature, differences in the rate of soft-tissue facial aging exists and varies according to the decade of life, sex, and ancestry [46,47]. Recent studies on the facial approximation of the nose among South African groups [48] and on other European and Asian populations [7], demonstrate the importance of considering factors such as sex and ancestry in the approximation of the nose. Effective techniques considering the effects of population, sexual dimorphism, and aging on the morphology of the nose need to be developed. Failure to account for this suite of variations may impact on the accuracy of the final facial approximation.
To further improve the accuracy of facial approximation of the nose in the South African population, this study proposes the development of a computer-based method using large databases of 3D representations of hard- and soft-tissues of the face. In general, all computer-based methods share the foundational premise that information about the complete skull versus information of the skin is used for mapping a template face onto a dry skull [49]. The prediction is performed by using a soft-tissue representation generated from the database by applying a deformation, based on the correlation between skin and skull-surfaces incorporated in the database. As compared to a human expert, a computer is consistent and objective. The computer integrates all the modeling assumptions and repeatedly generates the same output data. As compared to forensic artists, some procedures can be automated, such as the creation of multiple approximations from the same target skull, using different modeling assumptions (ancestry, age, sex). An additional advantage of using computer-based facial approximation is the convenience of visualization.
Furthermore, the facial approximation process is more accessible to a wide range of forensic experts without extensive expertise in computer science or computer-based facial approximation fields. In practice, software development for computerized facial approximations of an individual could benefit law enforcement agencies by allowing faster, easier, and more efficient generations of multiple representations of an individual. Tilotta and colleagues [50] and Schlager [7] developed computer-assisted methods for the prediction of the structure of the external surface of the nose based on conventional computer tomography (CT) scans. Compared to manual methods, automation of facial approximation of the nose, using large 3D surface samples, offered increased objectivity and the possibility of standardization. However, the use of conventional CT scans as initial references for facial approximation methods is influenced by supination effects on the face due to the horizontal position of the patient during scanning [[51], [52], [53]]. In addition, the slice thickness of conventional CT scans, which generally ranges from 0.6 mm to 1.5 mm [7,13,50], may induce errors in the manual landmark placement on the 3D hard- and soft-tissue surfaces. Although, automation of facial approximation of the nose increased objectivity as compared to the traditional manual methods, the manual placements of landmarks on large 3D surface samples affected the accuracy of the standardization. Indeed, these methods for approximation of the nose involve manual placements of landmarks for the definition of the region of interest [7,50]. Manual placement of landmarks is extremely time-consuming on large 3D surface samples and may induce important observer subjectivity and errors in placing these landmarks. As a result, manual landmarking may render the analysis less repeatable and accurate for the facial approximation process. To address this shortcoming, a new computer-assisted method is proposed in this study.
This study aimed to provide accurate statistical models for predicting nasal soft-tissue shape from information about the underlying skull subtract among a CBCT South African sample. The acquisition and extraction of the relevant anatomical structures (hard- and soft-tissue) was performed using an automated three-dimensional (3D) method based on an automatic dense landmarking procedure, and analyzed by geometric morphometric methods (GMM). Firstly, a shape variation analysis was performed to provide an overview of the influence of sex, aging, and allometry on the overall hard- and soft-tissue shape variation. Secondly, statistical models for predicting nasal soft-tissue shape from information about the underlying hard-tissue configuration were created, and additional factors such as sex and age were added to the models as additional information in the predictors. To compare our results to other research results comparable to the methods proposed in this study, the accuracy of the estimated soft-tissue nose was evaluated in terms of metric deviations.
