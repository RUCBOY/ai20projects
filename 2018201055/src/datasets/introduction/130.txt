Tobacco use is the main preventable cause of death and disease worldwide, accounting for more than five million deaths annually (Warren et al., 2009). Adolescent smoking is a major factor for adult smoking (Hu et al., 2006, Thomas et al., 2013), with those starting at earlier ages being more likely to remain regular smokers and less likely to quit (Elders et al., 1994, Tyas and Pederson, 1998, Riggs et al., 2007, Walker and Loprinzi, 2014, Wiener et al., 2016). Tobacco use often starts in adolescence (Gilman et al., 2003). It thus makes sense to target smoking prevention programs to young adolescents.
School-based programs offer the advantage of reaching a very high percentage of children (Thomas et al., 2013, Hodder et al., 2014). There are a wide variety of school-based programs aimed at decreasing substance use (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Schools: School-based education for drug abuse prevention. Vienna, ISBN 92-1-, 2004, Gorman et al., 2007, Dobbins et al., 2008, Faggiano et al., 2008, Ringwalt et al., 2008, Thomas et al., 2013), with most targeted toward increasing youth knowledge of the effects of substances, supporting attitudes and values that decrease the likelihood of substance use, and providing youth with the skills to resist substance use. For a program aimed at decreasing substance use to be effective it is important that it addresses each of these component parts.
Our work in this study was aimed at increasing youth knowledge of the physiological and pharmacological effects of nicotine. To accomplish this, we used active learning strategies, as this type of learning has been shown to highly effective in helping students process, understand and use information, as well as retain the information they have learned (Taraban et al., 2007, Dyson et al., 2009, Gleason and PharmD, 2011). Interacting with their classmates and the materials in an active learning session motivates the students to be positively engaged in the material (Ajewole, 1991, Kettanurak et al., 2001, Gleason and PharmD, 2011, Boctor, 2013, Crozier, 2015), preventing boredom that occurs from passively listening to a lecture (Ajewole, 1991, Kettanurak et al., 2001, Salomon, 1983). Not only does the process of active learning significantly influence student’s learning of scientific information, but much more information is retained when the knowledge is actively learned (Ajewole, 1991, Boctor, 2013, Gleason and PharmD, 2011, Gonen et al., 2016, Grol et al., 2017, Gross et al., 2017, Taraban et al., 2007).
An attractive, yet previously elusive, component of a school-based program directed toward substance abuse is one that enables students to directly observe and quantify behavioral effects of an addictive substance (e.g. nicotine, alcohol) in a living organism. Mammals (e.g. rats, mice) are used in research laboratories to study preclinical effects of drugs of abuse, but methodological, legal and practical issues make them unsuitable for school-based programs. A cost-effective alternative is planarians, which are flatworms with primitive, yet centralized, nervous systems (Raffa and Rawls, 2008). Planarians, following exposure to nicotine and other stimulant drugs, show mammalian-like behaviors that include conditioned place preference, physical dependence, enhanced motility, and stereotypical activity (e.g. C-shape spasms or hyperkinesias) (Pagan et al., 2009, Rawls et al., 2011, Raffa et al., 2013, Phelps et al., 2019). For the present program, C-shapes were selected as the endpoint. C-shapes induced by nicotine are highly reproducible and quantifiable, and resemble nicotine-induced stereotypical behavior in rodents. Although the exact relationship between C-shape spasms displayed by planarians and stereotypy displayed by rodents is unclear (Le Foll and Goldberg, 2005), drugs that possess abuse liability in humans often enhance stereotypical activity in rodents (Koob, 1992). Moreover, nicotine-induced C-spasms are concentration-dependent, with lower concentrations producing minimal effects and higher concentrations eliciting marked enhancements (Rawls et al., 2011). Planarians also possess mammalian-like neurotransmitter systems, including dopamine, serotonin, GABA and glutamate, which are known to underlie nicotine-induced motor and reinforcing effects (Nishimura et al., 2010).
Thus, to begin teaching students about behavioral effects of nicotine related to abuse liability, we made use of the aforementioned studies showing that nicotine produces C-spasms in planarians. Student learning about the physiological and pharmacological effects of nicotine was facilitated by having them perform experiments in which planarians were exposed to various concentrations of nicotine and the influence of nicotine on their behavior was observed, quantified, recorded and students were then given the opportunity to discuss their findings with others and draw conclusions from their experimental findings. We report here that this strategy was highly effective in teaching basic principles about how nicotine influences an animal’s physiology and providing a context in which students (4th through 12th grade) learned about the brain mechanisms leading to addictive behaviors.
