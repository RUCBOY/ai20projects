Gallbladder polyp is a common disease with a reported prevalence variation between 4 and 7% [6], [26]. It can be classified as neoplastic and non-neoplastic lesions. Surgical treatment is necessary for neoplastic polyps [12], including adenomas, adenocarcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and other types of malignant tumors[17], [27]. Non-neoplastic polyps mainly include cholesterol, inflammatory polyps, adenomyosis, fibromas, representing for 90–95% of gallbladder polyps, which have rare or no malignant transformation possibility [17], [27]. Non-neoplastic polyps are unnecessary to be over treated with operation, but the regular follow-up is required. However, current guidelines only recommend cholecystectomy for gallbladder polyp with diameter larger than 10 mm [12], [25]. Therefore, accurate preoperative diagnosis is important for the decision making for the management of gallbladder polyps.
Many imaging techniques, such as transabdominal ultrasonography, endoscopic ultrasonography, MRI, CT or PET-CT have been used for the diagnosis of gallbladder polyps, especially ultrasound examination. Ultrasonography is undoubtedly the first-line imaging investigation for the diagnosis of gallbladder diseases. High resolution ultrasonography (HRUS) is an emerging new tool that is capable of depicting real-time static and dynamic morphological information [14]. HRUS represents the most frequently used diagnostic imaging modality in the diagnose and following up for gallbladder polyps with advantages of easily accessible, cheap, non-contrast and non-radioactive [2]. Its value has been established by many studies [8], [20], [29]. In our previous work, we have identified important features that can help the differential diagnosis of gallbladder polyps using conventional ultrasound examination and developed a diagnostic scoring system [19]. However, a reliable diagnostic result requires expertise to analyze the image with high concentration and accuracy. Currently, the results from the HRUS image analysis were disappointing with an accuracy varing between 65 and 92%, especially for unexperienced sonologists [8], [10], [20], [29], which results in many overtreatment and undertreatment cases in clinics.
Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system has its excellent potential in image based diagnosis. In [1], a CAD system is proposed to aid radiologists for a more reliable interpretation of ultrasound images of liver lesions; In [21], an expert-annotated speckle-tracking echocardiographic dataset were used for developing an automated system based on machine learning algorithms; A system called DNN-CAD to identify neoplastic or hyperplastic colorectal polyps was developed by Chen et al. [5] and achieved a high accuracy with a shorter time than endoscopists; It was also shown by Shichijo et al. [24] that a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) based diagnosis system for helicobacter pylori infection could achieve a higher accuracy and in a considerably shorter time compared to manual diagnosis by endoscopists. In this study, we developed a novel system of CAD with an AdaBoost classifier to analyze and diagnose the pathological result of gallbladder polyps (cholesterol and neoplastic lesions) by transabdominal HRUS imaging. We compared the performance of different image segmentation algorithms and the diagnostic accuracy between our proposed CAD system, CNN and sonologists in different experience levels to evaluate its clinical application.
