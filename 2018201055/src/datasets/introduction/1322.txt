Cancer is a major threat to human health and life in the world. Chemotherapy is still a predominant therapeutic modality in the clinical treatment of cancer [1]. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), another promising therapeutic strategy, has been widely used in the treatment of various cancers due to its noninvasive, less undesired side effects and high selectivity [1], [2], [3]. In the process of PDT, photosensitizers (PSs) are activated by laser irradiation of specific wavelength and then produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) including singlet oxygen (1O2), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide radical (O2–), to elicit tumor cells death or apoptosis [4], [5], [6]. Given different antineoplastic mechanisms, PDT together with chemotherapy has used to potentiate the antitumor effects.
Nano-drug delivery systems (nano-DDS) have been employed to co-deliver chemotherapeutic agents and PSs for synergistic cancer therapy [7], [8], [9]. However, most of the prepared procedure of nano-DDSs are typically sophisticated and difficult to promise reproducibility and quality control [10]. In addition, traditional carrier-based nano-DDSs are still far from satisfactory due to low drug loading and poor biocompatibility [11]. Therefore, it is highly desired to precisely design novel nano-systems to solve above dilemmas.
To construct the ingenious high-loading co-delivery systems of chemotherapeutic drugs and PSs, more attention has been paid to the computation simulation on the rational design of a stable nano-DDS [12,13]. For example, our team reported that well-designed dipeptide-based supramolecular nanocarrier could efficiently deliver camptothecin based on the structure-based virtual screening technique [14]. In addition, Zhang and his co-workers have also proved the formation mechanism of 1,1′-dioctadecyl- 3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) self-assemblies with the assistance of molecular docking [15].
Podophyllotoxin (PPT), a potent anti-tubulin agent, can significantly inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistant (MDR) of tumor cells [16], [17], [18]. Moreover, it has also been reported that PPT could increase intracellular ROS levels, which was ascribed to PPT-induced cells apoptosis via acting on the S phase of the cell cycle [19]. Nevertheless, PPT has poor water solubility, non-selective distribution and low maximum tolerated dose, hindering its clinical application [20,21].
Herein, the similarities in molecular properties between PPT and pyropheophorbide a (PPa, a common PS) were firstly investigated by dynamic simulations. Meanwhile, the intermolecular interactions between them were also evaluated via molecular docking. A novel chem-photodynamic drugs self-delivery system (PPT/PPa NPs) was reasonably built. By the in vitro and in vivo experiments, PPT/PPa NPs showed better cellular uptake efficiency, stronger cytotoxicity and larger accumulation amount at tumor tissues than that of PPa solution. Notably, PPT/PPa NPs exhibited great synergistic anti-tumor effect in 4T1 breast tumor xenograft model compared with the mixture of PPT and PPa. Such computer-aided self-delivery nanoplatform of combinational chem-PDT has been a promising strategy in future clinical applications.
