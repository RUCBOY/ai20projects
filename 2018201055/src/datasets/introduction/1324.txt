Non-destructive estimation methods are very useful in packaging systems, since based on them the possibility to the online prediction of inner properties of fruits can be made. Machine vision is a technique of Electronics field which is useful to be applied in modern pH value estimation systems. Regarding the relationship between electronic systems based on machine vision, it should be mentioned that there are two main types of intelligence: either artificial intelligence or machine intelligence. In machine vision, which is useful for developing electronic pH value estimation systems, mainly machine intelligence has been used. These systems could be either hardware or software based. We focus on software-based machine vision systems here. The number of recent techniques and applications behind the field of computer vision is very broad and huge, having among the first ones (theoretical) the level sets [17], spectral clustering and cellular learning automata [7], to name a few, and among the second (applications) texture recognition [5], lung nodule detection [10], [19], real-time pedestrian detection [11], [22], iris recognition [28], and coastline detection [16], to name a few.
Regarding the particular topic of interest here, different researchers have recently proposed new programs to determine the values of inner properties of various fruits. Generally speaking, the accuracy of such systems is not very high. Based on the view point of some consumers, the main quality aspects for fruits and vegetables are size, appearance and color, but other persons believe that inner properties of fruits and vegetables such as titratable acidity (TA), soluble solids content (SSC), soluble solids to acid (SSC/TA) ratio and texture, are more important than external properties or appearance [1], [21], [3], [4], [13]. Several studies for grading based on size, mass, or volume are already available in the literature, like for instance [18], [6], [26], [24]. The common basics under all these methods is image processing. In fact, only after proper image segmentation and feature extraction, based on different linear or non-linear methods, various inner fruit properties are estimated. Some valid examples of researches that focus over the determination of inner properties in a non-destructive fashion, include [27], [2], [23], [25].
Rungpichayapichet et al. [23] proposed a non-destructive method for predicting physicochemical characteristics of firmness, TSS, and TA of mango fruit at different stages of ripening using hyperspectral images. For the training phase of the proposed algorithm, 160 mango fruit samples were used, unhealthy mango fruits were isolated by visual inspection, and the remainder mangos were selected for testing purposes. Predictive models were developed using spectral data in visible and infrared regions by means of a least partial squares regression. A multiple linear regression method was used to identify 16 important factors in firmness, 17 factors in TA, and 20 factors in TSS. Results showed that there is an important correlation between hyperspectral images and physicochemical properties of firmness, TSS and TA. The value of the determination coefficient and the root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between hyperspectral images and firmness, R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 2.83, hyperspectral and TSS R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 0.24% and hyperspectral and TA R2 = 0.5 and RMSE = 2.0%.
Munera et al. [20] used visible and near-infrared spectral reflection images to determine the physicochemical properties and evaluate internal quality of two nectarine varieties, BigTop and Magique, during the ripeness period using both ripening index (RPI) and internal quality index (IQI). Fruits were collected from garden, in Lerida of Spain, during the maturity period. Samples were placed in groups with 25 samples and stored under controlled conditions (temperature 15  °C and relative humidity 90%). In each experiment, in addition to the extraction of properties like firmness, TSS, TA and meat color, using an industrial camera (CoolSNAP ES, Photometrics, AZ, USA), 60 hyperspectral pictures were taken, in the range of 450 nm to 1040 nm wavelengths (every 10 nm, one image). In the next stage, RPI and IQI indeces were computed in order to link spectral information with physicochemical properties from nectarine, and input in a least partial squares regression system. Results showed a highest correlation coefficient of determination value of 0.87.
The aim of this study is to introduce a machine vision system for non-destructive determination of the pH values in three different orange varieties, Bam, Blood and Thomson, based on image processing and various hybrid Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. This system may be useful in the packaging industry including grading based on the pH value.
