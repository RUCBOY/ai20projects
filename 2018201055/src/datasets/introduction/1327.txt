More than 50 years ago, Resler and Rosensweig [1] reported the first synthesis of a stable suspension of magnetic nanoparticles in a magneto-passive carrier liquid, nowadays known as a ferrofluid or magnetic fluid. This was the first step in designing soft magnetic materials which respond to external magnetic fields. The first attempts to describe ferrofluid properties theoretically [2], [3] were based on the theory of an ideal (noninteracting) paramagnetic gas [4], [5], according to which the fractional (scalar) magnetization ML and initial magnetic susceptibility χL of ferrofluids are determined by a simple and convenient Langevin law: (1)ML=cothα−1α,χL=ρm23kBT,where ρ is the magnetic particle number concentration and α=mH∕kBT is the Langevin parameter (the relation of the Zeeman interaction energy of the particle magnetic moment m with the external magnetic field H to the thermal energy kBT=β−1).
Since then ferrofluids have been the subject of intense scrutiny, with regard to their structure, phase behavior, and dynamics [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. It became clear that a theory based on a single-particle approximation, like expressions (1), is only valid for an infinitely diluted suspension, when the interparticle magnetic interactions can be neglected. It was proved that interparticle magnetic correlations greatly increase the static magnetic susceptibility of ferrofluids [11], [13], [14], [15], change the spectrum of its dynamic susceptibility [10], [16], [17], and lead to the self-assembly of ferroparticles into chains, rings, branched structures, and three-dimensional percolating networks [18], [19]. A vast range of theoretical models has been developed to link the macroscopic properties of ferrofluids to their internal microscopic structure and the interactions between the magnetic nanoparticles. Examples include Weiss’s mean-field theory [20], [21], the mean-spherical approximation closure of the Ornstein–Zernike equation [22], [23], the high-temperature approximation [24], first-order [25] and second-order modified mean-field theories [26], and the Born–Mayer cluster-expansion theories [27], [28].
Today, the design of soft magnetic materials has steadily progressed: it is now possible to embed magnetic particles into polymer matrices, creating magnetoresponsive elastomers and ferrogels. These materials can be remotely aligned and guided under external fields [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], which has opened up broad opportunities for theirs applications in biomedicine and technology [34], [35], [36], [37]. Current experimental techniques offer different strategies for the synthesis of magnetoresponsive elastomers and ferrogels. Usually, in ferrogels the polymer matrix is only weakly cross-linked; therefore, magnetic particles can diffuse through the network and build some agglomerates. Magnetoresponsive elastomers typically consist of a highly cross-linked matrix which is so compact that translations of particles dispersed in the matrix might be hindered, especially when the particles are large. The spatial distribution of particles in a magnetoresponsive elastomer can be either isotropic or anisotropic (chain-like, plane-like), that depends on the method of preparation [29], [38], [39], [40]. Isotropic distribution of magnetic particles inside an elastomer are achieved by cross-linking of a polymer melt with well-dispersed magnetic particles without applying external magnetic field. Using 3D printing technologies allows to embed particles in the given regular order [41]. The material properties significantly depend on the particles’ distribution in the material and the particle–matrix relationship [42].
Improving the synthesis technology and developing methods for using magnetoresponsive elastomers and ferrogels requires solving fundamental problems related to predicting the behavior of ensembles of magnetic particles in a polymer matrix. Because of the complex microstructure of these systems, their full explicit atomistic modeling unfeasible. Considerable simplifications at the microscopic level should be chosen very carefully in order to attain a proper representation of the experimental system. Computer simulation models usually represent the embedded magnetic particles as beads with point magnetic dipoles, whereas particle–particle and particle–polymer matrix interactions are modeled with different levels of detail [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]. Obviously, the more naturally the microscopic details are presented in a simulation model, the more expensive becomes the cost of computations. Another way to study the behavior of the ensembles of magnetic particles in a polymer matrix is the continuum-mechanics approach, which is based on the numerical solution of balance laws in different formulations and Maxwell’s equation for magnetic field [49], [50].
Theories resulting in explicit analytical expressions characterizing accurately the response of the magnetic particle ensemble in a polymer matrix on the external magnetic field still represent a challenge. The development of these theories is based on two main strategies dealing with the description of the internal structure of these systems. The first takes into account only particle–matrix interactions, using, for example, the effective Jeffreys model [51], [52], the Kelvin model [53], or assuming that the particles in the matrix are completely immobilized [54]. In the latter case, the reaction of the magnetic moment to an external field occurs only according to the Néel mechanism. The second strategy includes accounting for particle–particle dipolar interactions. These models were developed only for ensembles of immobilized magnetic particles, that correspond to systems with a sufficiently hard polymer matrix. In particular, the explicit expressions for the static magnetization and initial magnetic susceptibility of ensembles of immobilized superparamagnetic spherical particles were determined in [42], [55]; the dynamic magnetic susceptibility of an ensemble of immobilized superparamagnetic particles in a weak, linearly polarized ac magnetic field was studied in [56], where the particles’ easy magnetization axes were aligned with some given angle to the ac field. In these studies, it was assumed that particles were randomly distributed and fixed in the matrix; therefore, the discrete material properties were not taken into account. The interparticle dipole–dipole interaction was taken into account based on the first order modified mean-field model, in the framework of which the orientation of the magnetic moment of a randomly chosen particle is influenced by an external magnetic field and by the total dipolar field produced by all other magnetic moments.
In this paper, we study the effect of dipole–dipole interparticle interactions on the static thermodynamic and magnetic properties of an ensemble of magnetic particles embedded in a polymer matrix, taking their microscopic discrete structure explicitly into account. We assume that magnetic particles are embedded on the nodes of the regular cubic lattice and can rotate at lattice nodes under the influence of an external magnetic field and as a result of interparticle dipole–dipole interactions; however, particle translational degrees of freedom are turned off. This model will be studied theoretically based on rigorous methods of statistical physics as well as with help of computer simulation. Two types of real magnetic composites correspond to model system considered here. In the first case, the particles have a rigid connection with the carrier matrix and they are characterized by a Neel mechanism of magnetic moment relaxation. However, the internal magnetic anisotropy of particles in this case is low and the magnetic moment can freely rotate inside the particle body. Typically, the size of such particles is small and the dipole–field relationship turns out quite weak. In the second case, the particles can rotate in some “caverns” of the host medium and the orientation of the magnetic moment changes according to the Brownian mechanism. Usually such particles have a large size and react strongly with the field.
This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, the model system is described, the analytical results for the Helmholtz free energy expansion are derived, and simulation details are summarized. The results of a comparison of the theoretical predictions with simulation data are presented in Section 3. Section 4 concludes the article.
