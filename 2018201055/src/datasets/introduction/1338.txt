Online learning updates the model on the fly using only single or a chunk of new samples [1], [2]. Compared to traditional batch learning that needs all training samples to be prepared beforehand, online learning exhibits three major advantages. First, it allows data scale to grow infinitely, and thus is well-suited for endless or lifelong learning [3]. Second, online learning yields an up-to-date model by adapting to data dynamics, making it capable of handling non-stationary issues, such as the concept shift [4]. Third, online learning preserves history information, thus avoiding repetitive batch retraining from scratch and significantly reducing the computational effort. With these advantages, online learning is nowadays widely explored in various fields, such as big-data analysis [3], large-scaled medical image-based diagnosis [5], video stream data analysis [6], [7], non-stationary physiological signal recognition [8], wearable health-monitoring apparatus [9], and so on. In the present study, we will focus on online learning for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs).
By decoding the information of electroencephalography (EEG) signals, BCIs provide a feasible way for implementing direct brain-controlled devices [10], [11], or intelligent devices that perceive the user’s mental states [12]. Wearable/portable BCIs, holding the promise of bringing the fruitful outcome of decades of laboratory BCI studies to daily lives of end users, recently draw the attention of researchers. Several such experiments/prototypes have been reported, e.g., mobile P300 spellers [13], [14], wearable navigation systems [15], [16], assistive robot devices [17], head-mounted device (HMD)-based augmented reality (AR) systems [16], [18], wearable mental-load evaluation systems [19], [20], as well as convenient EEG sensors [21], [22], [23]. However, due to the resource constraint, the well-performed batch methods, such as support vector machine (SVM) [24], step-wise linear discriminant analysis (SWLDA) [25], and more recently the Riemannian [26] and tensor-based [27] approaches, etc., normally need the classifier to be trained on another professional computer before it is applied to the wearable/portable device. A challenge is how to update the model to meet the EEG changes, which may come from either internal (mental) or external (environmental) variations, and cause a drop of performance during the long-term use of a BCI. Although an out-of-device batch retraining could be a solution, an on-device updating or training would be more convenient and desirable. Online learning, benefiting from its adaptability and high-efficient computation, naturally fits for this purpose. Several methods have been evaluated, such as the online SVM [28], [29], the passive aggressive (PA) algorithm [30], [31], etc. However, online learning still needs to be examined in the field of the BCI, especially for the event-related potential (ERP)-based BCI, or traditionally called the P300 speller (see F. Lotte’s recent review on BCI classification algorithms [32]).
The sources causing the EEG changes may include: 1) EEG non-stationarity, 2) spatial-domain variation, and 3) poor recordings. EEG is believed to be short-term stationary, and thus the BCI performance can keep stable for hours or even for days. However, EEG non-stationarity cannot be overlooked from a long-term view. It may affect morphologies and latencies of the underlying ERP components, and deteriorate the BCI performance. EEG non-stationarity may be linked to a variety of factors, such as learning effect, habituation, age, etc., but is still not fully understood. Transfer learning has been used to handle the EEG changes between sessions or even between subjects [28], [29], [33], [34]. The basic concept under transfer learning is to use data recorded in one task to boost performance in another task [35]. For a BCI, the main role of transfer learning is to reduce the calibration effort, by using data from previous sessions or other subjects. Similarly, semi/un-supervised or self-calibration methods have also been employed for this purpose [36], [37], [38]. The calibration of a BCI is normally tedious and time-consuming for the end user, and how to reduce the calibration effort becomes an important issue in the BCI research. However, it is beyond the scope of the present study. Compared to EEG non-stationarity, due to the location-specific assumption of ERPs, a more severe sudden drop of performance may occur with spatial-domain variations, which are often caused by a shift or switch of headset every time wearing the device. To ease switching of headsets, D. Wu et al. [39] proposed an active learning method, and showed its effectiveness for reducing the recalibration effort from a new headset. Spatial-domain variations may also come from spatial-distribution changes of cortical activities. To handle this kind of variations, spatial filtering methods, such as xDAWN [40] and its adaptive form, axDAWN [30], etc., which aim to find the optimal spatial combination in multi-electrode EEG recordings, have been applied. As the third source, poor recordings, mainly arising from a sensor quality/impedance change, external noises, artifacts, etc., may worsen the signal quality. This kind of EEG changes can be compensated by the dynamic stopping technique [29], [41], whose basic idea is to adaptively adjust the amount of data required for judgment, by decreasing the amount of data at good signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and increasing it at bad SNRs, to maintain a high-enough BCI throughput at different signal quality levels. It should be noted that, because dynamic stopping is based on the assumption that only the relative noise level changes, it is often used in combination with other methods, such as transfer learning.
In the above, we have briefly summarized the main reasons for EEG changes and the coping strategies to date in the field of the BCI. Though performing well, some of them, such as transfer learning [28], [29], [33], [34] and active learning [39], are computationally demanding, whereas others, such as spatial filtering [30], [40] and dynamic stopping [29], [41], may work in conjunction with online learning. Meanwhile, the label retrieving strategies taken by semi/un-supervised methods [37], [38] could also be used by online learning, in cases when true labels are unavailable.
Although using sliding buffers, it is possible to transfer batch methods, such as SVM [28], as well as their incremental forms [29], to the online setting, several drawbacks may be encountered. One possible drawback is a drop of performance arising from reduced training samples. As we know, batch methods, such as SVM, generally need large-scaled samples to get high generalization performance. Another possible drawback is, due to a lack of adaptability, data selections may be required, indicating an increased computational effort. Therefore, a genuine online algorithm would be preferred.
We investigated an adaptive projected subgradient method (APSM) [42] for online learning of the BCI. APSM is derived based on the set theoretic estimation formulation and the projections onto convex sets theory in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and provides a unifying framework for both adaptive classification and regression tasks. Concurrent projections of APSM also make it possible to boost calculating efficiency through parallel computation. In the present study, we extended the general APSM to a shrinkage form. The convergence of the proposed method was proved. It was also shown that several new valuable properties, i.e., a stable and controllable fading effect, the easiness of tuning, the least norm solution, etc., were obtained. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated, and compared with those of the general APSM, the incremental support vector machine (ISVM) [29], and the PA algorithm [30], [31], through an ERP-based BCI experiment. Beyond the BCI, the proposed method potentially can also be used in other related fields that suffer from the EEG changes, such as for tackling the Template Aging issue in EEG-based biometrics [43].
