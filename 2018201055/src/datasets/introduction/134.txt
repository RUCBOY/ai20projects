Ostracism in the form of social exclusion, rejection or isolation has been shown to constitute a threat to fundamental human needs [1] and a painful experience [2] which exerts both short- and long-term detrimental effects on physical and mental health (e.g., [3]). Social connectedness and social support, in turn, have been considered a potential stress buffering mechanism [4, 5] with protective effects on several health-related variables such as life expectancy (e.g., [6]), fitness (e.g., [7]), and psychological well-being (e.g., [8]). Accordingly, experiences of social connectedness and disconnectedness are hypothesized to affect the two main human stress axes, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and the Sympathetic-Adrenal-Medullary (SAM) axis in a contrary manner [9]. Both axes are instigated from the hypothalamus and help the organism adapt to environmental demands such as social stressors by eliciting according cognitions and behaviors (e.g., the fight-or-flight response, tend-and-befriend response, see [10]). SAM reactivity includes immediate changes in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) such as the release of catecholamines and increased cardiovascular responses. The reactivity of physiological arousal by SNS can be measured using heart rate as a sympathetic and a subset of heart rate variability as a parasympathetic marker. HPA, in turn, reacts slower than SAM, and encompasses the release of the hormone cortisol, what is an inhibiting feedback mechanism for the HPA. Cortisol is an end-product of the HPA axis and plays a crucial role regarding the stress reactivity and restoring homeostasis. Usually it is measured in saliva or blood. The reactivity of both axes to stress is associated with physical and mental health (see [11] for an overview).
Past studies which used the Cyberball Paradigm [12]—a computer based ball tossing game designed to induce experiences of social exclusion in laboratory settings—reported significantly altered cortisol levels (e.g., [13], [14], [15], [16]) and blood pressure [15] in individuals who were excluded from the Cyberball game. Most notably, a blunted cortisol response to social exclusion was reported by some authors [17,18]. Contrary to this, other evidence suggests no impact of social exclusion on cortisol (e.g., [19], [20], [21], [22]). In sum, data on the exact psychophysiological impact of ostracism experiences are still contradictory, and more research is warranted to shed light on the according mechanisms. Also, a heightened focus has been put on cortisol reactivity in the context of ostracism experiences, the SNS response (HR and HRV), in turn, has rather been underrepresented.
Furthermore, most studies have focused on acute stress reactions, and only little research exists on the prolonged impact of social exclusion experiences on subsequent stress coping. Among the small number of studies, Weik et al. [23], [24], [25] found that a prior ostracism experience is linked to a suppressed cortisol reactivity in excluded individuals during a public speaking task in front of a TV camera. Typically, socio-evaluative stressors like a public speaking scenario are assumed to provoke increased HPA- and SNS-activity [58]. This is particularly true for a paradigm traditionally used in social stress research, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST; [26]). It consists of a standardized job interview and an arithmetic task in front of a jury and has been shown to induce significant levels of stress due to the perceived uncontrollability of the situation (Kudielka et al., 2004). Williamson et al. [27], for instance, who used the TSST following the Cyberball exclusion scenario reported no changes in SNS reactivity to the TSST in those individuals who had been included in the game. Unlike most prior research, the authors attributed the decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as HR to the inclusion manipulation, and hence concluded that this may be explained by stress-reducing effects of perceived social support [28], [29], [30]. Overall, the scarcity of empirical evidence as well as the heterogeneous findings regarding not only acute HPA and SNS responses to social exclusion but also prolonged stress reactivity to other forms of social stress (e.g., [24,25,27]), warrant further research.
Additionally, methodological concerns have been expressed about the artificial nature of the traditional Cyberball paradigm (e.g., [24,31]). This has led to the development of potentially more ecologically valid alternatives in sensorially enriched virtual environments (VE) (see [32], [33], [34]). Past work suggests that the experience of being excluded from a virtual reality (VR)-based ball-tossing game [32,35] or socially supported by a virtual character [30] seems to approximate experiences observed in comparable “real” interactions. But despite this work, there is still a lack of research to HPA and SNS reactivity regarding virtual ostracism or inclusion compared to real-life interactions. A particular challenge of this setup lies in the fact that virtual characters have to be distinguished with regards to their agency, i.e. whether they are controlled by another human being (avatar) or whether they represent a computer algorithm (agent) [36]. While both seem to cause the same immediate reaction (i.e., they both pose the same threat to human needs in the context of social exclusion, e.g., [35]), the delayed reaction to avatars and agents differs. While it has been hypothesized that the observed differences may be due to different attribution mechanisms [35, 37], research is still in its infancy and lacks knowledge about the influence of virtual and real-life ostracism and inclusion on subsequent stressors.
Therefore, this research sets out to gain a better integrative understanding about differences between ostracism and social inclusion regarding alterations of HPA and SNS reactivity and investigates prolonged effects on HPA and SNS reactivity and recovery in a subsequent socio-evaluative task (TSST). Moreover, this study uses a novel ecologically valid paradigm (VR) to induce ostracism or social inclusion and investigates the influence of agency during ostracism or social inclusion (comparing: face-to-face, VR-avatar, VR-agent) on a subsequent stress response. Additionally, we controlled for the impact of fundamental social needs, perceived social support and affective cognitions (aggressive behavior, tendency to escape from the situation, emotional numbing) at baseline levels and after each stressor task.
