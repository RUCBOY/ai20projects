Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) were discovered using indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA) in the 1980s. Later, their main antigenic targets were identified to be proteins in the granules of neutrophil granulocytes. ANCAs are valuable serologic markers in various inflammatory disorders [1], [2]. In three of the small vessel vasculitides the presence and pathogenic role of ANCAs are so significant that they are grouped together as ANCA-associated vasculitides in the current Chapel Hill nosology system [3], [4]. Though not as crucial as in diagnosing vasculitides, detection of ANCA is helpful in managing inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Up to 88% of patients with ulcerative colitis have ANCA when assayed by indirect immunofluorescence method, while the rate is only 6–16% in Crohn’s disease. Several studies showed that the concomitant use of ANCA and antibodies to the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ASCA) has the highest diagnostic efficiency for differentiating ulcerative colitis from Crohn’s disease [13], [14]. In studies evaluating autoimmune liver disorders the majority of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are reported to be reactive to ANCA antigens, while a smaller fraction is positive in autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis. The significance of ANCA testing in autoimmune liver diseases is also highlighted by the fact that it is part of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group revised diagnostic scoring system [15], [16]. ANCA can be detected in other systemic inflammatory (rheumatoid arthritis, Felty’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus) and infectious (endocarditis, pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection) diseases. Sometimes ANCA occur as a paraneoplastic phenomenon or due to adverse drug reaction (hydralazine, propylthiouracil, levamisole) [2].
In the beginning indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) tests were used in ANCA diagnostics since IFA has the obvious advantage of being able to detect antibodies to all neutrophil granulocyte constituents even if the antigen is not characterized. To reduce variability of visual interpretation fluorescence patterns are now read according to the international consensus statement and its addendum [17], [18]. Classical diffuse cytoplasmic ‘C-ANCA’ is seen most frequently when anti-PR3 antibodies are present, while anti-MPO antibodies cause classical perinuclear fluorescence (‘P-ANCA’) on ethanol fixed granulocytes. Besides, ‘C-ANCA (atypical)’ and ‘atypical ANCA’ patterns are distinguished. Several laboratories use formaldehyde-fixed neutrophil granulocytes as an auxiliary substrate in addition to conventional ethanol fixation which is reported to be useful in differentiating between antinuclear antibody and ANCA and improves interpretation of patterns [19], [20].
Many, especially high throughput laboratories consider IIF methods cumbersome, labor intensive and time consuming. Other shortcomings include difficult automatization and standardization, high variability of results, subjective pattern identification, need for dark room and the possibility of transcription error during result entry [21], [22], [23]. Demand spurred reagent manufacturers to develop computer-aided immunofluorescence microscopes capable of capturing digital images of fluorescence patterns and analyzing them using software algorithms. So far eight systems were marketed which are able to discriminate at least antinuclear antibody positivity and negativity on HEp-2 cell layer [24], [25], [26]. To our knowledge the Aklides (Medipan), EUROPattern (EUROIMMUN), Helios (AESKU), Image Navigator (Immuno Concepts), Nova View (Inova) and Zenit Pro (Menarini) microscopes can also take and analyze ANCA IIF images.
Our aim was to compare the evaluation of ANCA slides using the EUROIMMUN EUROPattern automated fluorescence microscope and traditional visual reading on a substantial number of samples received in a routine setting from a wide spectrum of tertiary health care providers including immunology, rheumatology, nephrology, gastroenterology and hepatology outpatient and inpatient clinics.
