Dietary metabolizable energy (ME) strongly influences the cost of feed for poultry, and it is the first consideration for formulation. Under many practical conditions, the ME of commercial diets is calculated from tabulated energetic values of individual ingredients and their concentrations (Mateos et al., 2018) and can be confirmed using in vivo energy balance experiments (Hill and Anderson, 1958; Sibbald, 1976; Farrell, 1978; Sibbald, 1983; Bourdillon et al., 1990). However, the in vivo procedures are inefficient, time-consuming, expensive, and consequently insufficient to rapidly determine ME values when producing commercial diets (Mateos et al., 2018). Therefore, the development of a rapid, standardized laboratory procedure to estimate the ME of diets is of interest to poultry nutritionists (Jha and Tiwari, 2016; Święch, 2017; Mateos et al., 2018).
In vitro digestion can predict nutrient digestibility of feed for poultry because it mimics the major process of in vivo digestion (Sakamoto et al., 1980; Clunies et al., 1984; Valdes and Leeson, 1992; Losada et al., 2009, 2010; Yegani et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2014; Bryan et al., 2018; Pan et al., 2018). However, conventional in vitro digestion has redundant steps that are subject to an operator who must manually adjust the digestion conditions and separate the digested byproduct (Sakamoto et al., 1980; Clunies et al., 1984; Clunies and Leeson, 1984; Valdes and Leeson, 1992; Boisen and Fernández, 1997; Yegani and Korver, 2012). Recently, we developed a novel, computer-controlled simulated digestion system (CCSDS) to automatically predict the digestibility of feed for roosters (Zhao et al., 2014). The in vitro digestible energy (IVDE) determined with CCSDS was highly correlated with ME across 16 feed ingredients (Zhao et al., 2014). However, little work has verified these findings in compound diets. Furthermore, the sensitivity of IVDE is unknown when the dietary ME values vary by 50 to 100 kcal/kg. Using rooster as an animal model, the objectives of this study were to 1) test the sensitivity of IVDE of diets across a wide range of ME and 2) establish and validate a prediction model of ME from IVDE in compound diets made with various cereal grains.
