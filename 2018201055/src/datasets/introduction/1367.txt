Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a noninvasive technology that enables communication between the user's brain and a digital device (e.g. smart wheelchairs, computers, or prosthesis), usually named agent. BCI allows the recognition of the user's intention by decoding the neural activity through electroencephalography (EEG) in order to control the agent and improve its performances. Reaching this goal implies high cognitive attention and effort, since the user is asked a considerable concentration on the stimuli provided while operating a BCI.
In literature, many works analyzed the capability of the BCI to recognize erroneous behavior of agents directly from the user's brain signals [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Errors in the recognition of the user's intention elicit potentials called evoked Error-related EEG Potentials (ErrPs). ErrPs were analyzed for the first time in 1990, in a study about choice-reaction tasks [8]; in the same work, the typical ErrPs waveform was defined. In this paradigm, the user monitors the agent's actions providing a feedback that can be used to improve the overall performance of the agent. ErrP is physiologically defined as a two components brain signal, consisting in negative and positive peaks, associated with the response monitoring and error detection processes. Both peaks originate in the anterior cingulate cortex, a frontal brain structure involved in the cognitive and affective brain processes [9]. Typically, the signal is generated within 500 ms from the erroneous agent decision, where the first component is a negative peak at almost 50–100 ms. After the negative peak, a positive peak is generated, further divided into fronto-central and centroparietal components [10].
The works [1,2] provide and explain some examples where ErrP signals are generated when a user monitors the performance of an agent, without performing a direct control. Unlike traditional BCI systems, the user does not provide continuous commands, but only monitors the agent's performance, thus making possible to tailor the agent's behavior to the user's needs and preferences [3]. Furthermore, in the experimental protocol proposed in [1], the user tried to move a cursor towards a target location (either using a keyboard or mental commands). Moreover, it showed the possibility to recognize and correct an erroneous decision of the agent exploiting the EEG signals.
The application of ErrPs in BCI technology has increased during the last years, especially for the correction of the system behavior through what is called reinforcement learning. Precisely, the most common application of ErrP was done in BCI spellers, where during the spelling of a word, a character can be discarded if wrong [4]. ErrPs can be involved as a suitable alternative or a complementary signal for BCI systems, especially as supervision or feedback signal during the execution of the task [7]. ErrPs have turned out to be used for fixing this kind of problems, as demonstrated in an experiment carried in [5], where a biofeedback based on ErrPs is applied to a closed-loop system for the behavioral correction of a robot. The feasibility in using the ErrPs combined to BCI signals for correcting the erroneous commands was investigated in [6]; in addition, the authors in [11] found out that ErrPs are also elicited as a misinterpretation of user's intent. Another research [12] proposed the classification of error related potentials from EEG during a real-world driving task. While the subject was driving, a directional cue was shown before reaching an intersection and the proposed system infers whether the cued direction coincided with the subject's intention. Other works investigated the co-adaptation of human-agent using ErrPs and decoding of ErrPs in tasks with continuous feedback [13,14].
The most important challenge of non-invasive BCI applications relates to the performances, since the control cannot offer a constant level of assistance due to the weakness and noisy of EEG signals [15], [16], [17]. Consequently, the application of spatial filters to improve the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and the single-trial classification is worthy of investigation. Spatial filters are proposed in the literature with the aim to increase the SNR by using a weighted sum of all electrodes rather than relying on a single, or a small sub-set, of EEG channels. Some examples of spatial filters are the so-called xDAWN and the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) [15,18]. Variants and extensions of CSP are proposed in [18], [19], [20], trying to overcome the drawbacks of CSP and improve the classification of single-trial EEG. In [21,22], the authors proposed adaptive spatial filters, the former based on ensembles of CSP patches whereas the latter based on a combination of blind source separation and regression analysis.
In this work, Functional Source Separation (FSS) has been considered to estimate a spatial filter for learning the ErrPs in BCI context. In order to enhance evoked ErrPs, FSS algorithm is designed by considering the ErrPs as a functional constraints [23], [24], [25], [26]. A direct comparison between the FSS [23] and the xDAWN algorithm [15,27] is presented to show the capability of the spatial filters to enhance the evoked ErrPs. Moreover, a single-trial classification was reported to assess the performances of FSS with respect to xDAWN. Moreover, the FSS and xDAWN based methods are also compared with the single channels Cz and FCz, usually selected to monitor ErrPs [1], in terms of single-trial classification.
Section 1 of this paper presents the experimental protocol, the spatial filters and the Bayesian Linear Discriminant Analysis (BLDA) classification algorithm used in the study. Section 2 exposes the idea of using the FSS as spatial filter for learning the ErrPs in BCI. Experimental results are presented in Section 3 including a qualitative evaluation of the spatial filters and the single-trial classification. In Section 4, we discuss the overall results and draw conclusion. Finally, in Section 5, we highlight the future works.
