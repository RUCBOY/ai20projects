Species have traditionally been delimited on the basis of morphological characteristics that could be determined by studies of museum specimens. In recent years, other methods have gained importance in species delimitation. For example, songs are now routinely used in taxonomic assessments of birds (reviews in Alström and Ranft, 2003, Alström et al., 2013). Of even greater significance is the rapid development of DNA sequencing technologies and analysis of genetic data. A large number of species in all major clades of organisms have been identified using DNA sequence data, and DNA data have proven particularly useful in groups with poor morphological differentiation among species (e.g. Díaz-Tapia et al., 2018, Funk et al., 2012, Garg et al., 2016, Janzen et al., 2017, Jeppson et al.,, Martinsson and Erséus, 2017). Early studies using DNA sequence data frequently compared genetic distances among species as a yardstick of taxonomic distinctness (“A and B differ by x%, and are therefore appropriately treated as separate species”) (e.g. Helbig et al., 1995). Later, the “barcoding gap”, i.e. the difference between within- and between-population genetic distances in a “barcoding gene”, such as the mitochondrial CO1, has frequently been used to delimit different species (Hebert et al., 2003, Hebert et al.,, JANZEN et al., 2009, Saitoh et al., 2015, WARD, 2009). These approaches have been criticised for various reasons, e.g. that they require arbitrarily determined distance thresholds, that differences in single genes do not necessarily reflect species-level differences or true relationships, and that distances calculated by different studies, using different methods or even using non-homologous sequences, cannot usually be directly compared; the importance of broad sampling across taxa has also been stressed (e.g. Bergsten et al., 2012 and references therein; Fregin et al., 2012, Knowles et al., 2007, Wiemers and Fiedler, 2007, Will et al., 2005, Yang and Rannala, 2017).
In recent years, several species delimitation programs based on molecular data have been developed (reviews by Camargo and Sites, 2013, Fujita et al., 2012, Rannala, 2015). Some of these use single loci as inputs, such as the General Mixed Yule Coalescent model (GMYC) (Pons et al., 2006, Reid and Carstens, 2012) and mPTP (Kapli et al., 2017). Other programs use multilocus data, which should be inherently superior to single-locus data, as a single-locus tree does not necessarily agree with the species tree (Edwards, 2009, Maddison and Wiens, 1997, Page and Charleston, 1998), and inevitably provides less information than a multilocus dataset. Some such approaches use Bayes Factors to discriminate between species hypotheses (Grummer et al., 2014, Leaché et al., 2014). In contrast, BPP (Flouri et al., 2018, Yang, 2015, Yang and Rannala, 2010, Yang and Rannala, 2014, Yang and Rannala, 2017), DISSECT (Jones et al., 2015) and its successor STACEY (Jones, 2015, Jones, 2017) in the BEAST2 package (Bouckaert et al., 2014) apply the multispecies coalescent model (MSC; Rannala and Yang, 2003) in a Bayesian framework to jointly infer the phylogeny and delimit species. The MSC accounts for incomplete lineage sorting and hence for the ubiquitous gene tree vs. species tree conflict (Rannala and Yang, 2003). However, MSC methods typically do not account for gene flow (with a few exceptions, e.g. IMa3 [Hey, 2010] and DENIM [Jones, 2019]), which could result in the merging of distinct lineages or underestimation of their divergence times (Camargo et al., 2012), and Leaché et al. (2019) showed that violations of the assumptions make the MSC methods inconsistent, such that more data will lead to more “species”. The recently published multispecies-coalescent-with-introgression (MSci) model accommodates introgression, although genomic data may be needed to properly account for this process (Flouris et al., 2020).
Here, we investigate species limits in the genus Alaudala in the avian family Alaudidae (larks) using a Bayesian species delimitation method as well as more traditional methods based on multiple independent data. From a taxonomic point of view, the Alaudidae is one of the least studied of the families within the superfamily Sylvioidea (reviewed in Alström et al., 2013a). The family comprises approximately 100 species distributed across six continents, although most occur in Africa (nearly 80% of the species) and Eurasia (nearly 40% of the species; some overlap with Africa) (Gill et al., 2020). In Africa, there are two main centres of diversity: one in the north-east arid zone (Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia) and one in the south-west arid zone (South Africa, Namibia and Botswana) (de Juana et al., 2004). Larks are found in various types of open habitats, ranging from sandy or stony deserts to tundra, steppe and savannah (de Juana et al., 2004).
The number of recognised species of larks has increased by nearly 30% over the past six decades (Peters, 1960, 76 species; Gill et al., 2020, 98 species). This increase is due largely to studies of molecular and/or vocal data that have revealed considerable cryptic diversity and the distinctness of several taxa that were previously treated as subspecies of the same species (Alström, 1998, Guillaumet et al., 2005, Guillaumet et al., 2006, Guillaumet et al., 2008, RYAN et al., 1998, Ryan and Bloomer, 1999). In addition, ALSTRÖM et al., 2013, Drovetski et al., 2014, Ghorbani et al., 2020a, Stervander et al., 2016 have highlighted multiple cases of deep mitochondrial divergences among taxa that are presently usually considered to be conspecific. It seems likely that the number of species of larks will continue to increase as new studies are undertaken using modern integrative methods combining different classes of data (morphological, vocal, genetic, behavioural and other data).
Our knowledge of phylogenetic relationships has also improved markedly in recent years. Only one comprehensive molecular phylogeny has been published for the Alaudidae to date, comprising >80% of the species (Alström et al., 2013b). This study revealed multiple cases of parallel evolution as well as strongly divergent closely related lineages. It also exposed an exceptionally high level of disagreement between traditional morphology-based classifications and phylogenetic relationships. For example, in the genus Calandrella, the type species (Red-capped Lark C. cinerea) and two other Calandrella species formed the sister clade to the morphologically strikingly different genus Eremophila, whereas four other species traditionally placed in Calandrella were found to form the sister clade to the markedly different-looking Eremalauda and Chersophilus. Alström et al. (2013b) reinstated the genus name Alaudala for the second of these traditional Calandrella clades, which included the Lesser Short-toed Lark A. rufescens, Asian Short-toed Lark A. cheleensis and Sand Lark A. raytal, and which form the focus of the present study.
The Alaudala rufescens complex, as here defined, comprises A. rufescens sensu stricto and A. cheleensis (Christidis, 2018, Gill et al., 2020). These two species are often treated as conspecific (under the name A. rufescens; e.g. de Juana and Suárez, 2020, del Hoyo and Collar, 2016, MEINERTZHAGEN, 1951, Shirihai and Svensson, 2018, Peters, 1960). In total, 15–16 subspecies are recognised within this complex, which is widespread, from the Canary Islands to north-eastern China (de Juana and Suárez, 2020, Christidis, 2018, Gill et al., 2020; Fig. 1). The Sand Lark A. raytal has also been treated as conspecific with A. rufescens (as well as the Somali Short-toed Lark A. somalica; Meinertzhagen, 1951), and Alström et al. (2013b) showed that A. raytal is nested within the A. rufescens complex. Alaudala raytal occurs from southern Iran to Myanmar, with usually three recognised subspecies (de Juana and Suárez, 2020, Christidis, 2018, Gill et al., 2020; Fig. 1). Ghorbani et al. (2020b) analysed mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA from throughout the range of the A. rufescens–A. raytal complex. They found five deeply diverged mtDNA clades, four of which were deeply separated also in trees based on nuclear DNA. They concluded that the taxonomy was in need of revision, but stressed that additional data were needed before any formal taxonomic revision should be undertaken.Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

We here assess the clades identified by Ghorbani et al. (2020b) combining non-genetic data such as plumage, morphometrics, vocalisations, sexual displays, habitat choice and geographical distributions (including bioclimatic separation) with gene/species trees. We also use a species delimitation method that is based on the multispecies coalescent (STACEY), and evaluate the performance of this computer-based method compared to our holistic integrative taxonomic approach.
