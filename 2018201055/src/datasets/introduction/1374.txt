The mean-field theory is widely used in modern nuclear structure [1]. The conventional way to incorporate the pairing correlation [2] at the mean-field level is by introducing quasiparticles [3]. This way has the advantage of simplicity: the ground state is written as a Slater Determinant (quasiparticle vacuum) that allows quick numerical algorithms and clear physical interpretations [1], [4]. The drawback is that quasiparticles break the exact particle number [1], [4]. Only the average particle number is guaranteed by the chemical potential, and effectively the target nucleus is substituted by an average over neighboring nuclei. The substitution error may not be small, especially in phase transition regions of sharp property changes.
To cue the problems, projecting onto good particle number is necessary [1], [4]. When feasible, variation after projection (VAP) [5] is preferred over projection after variation (PAV) [1], [4]. The standard way of projecting is by numerical integration over the gauge angle [4], [5]. However, this way may not be very easy when performing VAP, because the time-consuming projection is needed many times [6]. In the literature there are far fewer realistic applications of VAP+BCS (for example, see [5], [7], [8], [9]) or VAP+HFB (for example, see [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]) than those of the HF+BCS or HFB theory without projection.
It is easy to analytically project the quasiparticle vacuum onto good particle number — the result is a coherent-pair condensate [state of zero generalized seniority [15], see Eq. (1)]. In Ref. [16] we proposed a scheme to apply the variational principle directly to the coherent-pair condensate (VDPC). The result is equivalent to that of VAP, but VDPC always conserves the particle number and avoids the time-consuming numerical projection. Reference [16] considers VDPC+BCS, and this work publishes its computer code. Our next work will extend to VDPC+HFB. For a literature review in more detail, please see the introduction part of Ref. [16].
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the analytical VDPC expressions used in coding. Section 3 describes the computer code. Then we apply the code to a semirealistic example in Section 4 and to the pairing Hamiltonian in Section 5. The work is summarized in Section 6.
