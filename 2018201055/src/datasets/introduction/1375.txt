Coupling is a powerful technique in probability theory, with which random variables can be linked to or compared with each other. It has been widely used in the studies of random walks and Markov chains, interacting particle systems and diffusions, just name a few, in order to establish limit theorems about them, to develop approximations for them, or to derive correlation inequalities between them [1]. Coupling has also been employed as a key tool in the theory of optimal transport [2]. In computer science, it has been widely applied in analysis of random algorithms, machine learning, and verification of security protocols and differential privacy (for example, see [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]).
Roughly speaking, given two probability distributions, coupling them means constructing a joint distribution that admits them as marginals of the joint distribution. As is well known, there is a simple and natural correspondence between probability theory and quantum theory: probability distributions/density operators (mixed quantum states), marginal distributions/partial traces, and more. This correspondence suggests us to explore the possibility of generalising the coupling techniques for reasoning about quantum systems. Indeed, several attempts along this line have already been made; for example, a notion of quantum coupling was defined by Carlen, Lebowitz and Lieb [8] in their research on the extension problem of density operators, and it was beautifully used by Winter [9] to derive some uniform continuity bounds for quantum entropies.
The aim of this paper is to present a more systematic study of quantum couplings in the case of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We define a quantum generalisation of lifting, a coupling under certain constraints and establish several basic properties of quantum couplings and liftings. In particular, Strassen's theorem [10] is a fundamental theorem about couplings in probability theory that can be used to bound the probability of an event in a distribution by the probability of an event in another distribution coupled with the first. We prove a quantum generalisation of Strassen's theorem.
