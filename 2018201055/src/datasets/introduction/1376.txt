The development of polymer membranes with nanoscale structures has played a significant role in various fields, such as separation, catalysis, bio-sensor, drug delivery, water treatment and nanolithography etc. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Therefore, nanoporous membrane preparation has become a hotspot in membrane science.
Nowadays, a commonly used method to create pores in self-assembled block copolymer films is the etching of sacrificial domains or the extraction of an added homopolymer [8], [9], [10]. This method is so complicated to prepare the nanoporous membrane. To overcome this problem, Karunakaran et al. [11] developed a simpler method to prepare nanoporous membranes by combining self-assembly with non-solvent induced phase separation (NIPS). The nanopores are formed during immersion of a concentrated block copolymer (BCP) solution in a water bath (non-solvent). NIPS is the most commonly used method because of its simplicity. Porous membranes prepared by the NIPS method have an ordered and uniform pore size, and the preparation process is simple. Besides NIPS [12], other available methods of preparing nanoporous membranes include thermal induced phase separation (TIPS) [13] and vapor induced phase separation (VIPS) [14].
Today, some block copolymers have been prepared to form porous membrane by block copolymer self-assembly. Most of them contains at least one hydrophobic group and one hydrophilic group. For instance, Karunakaran et al. prepared nanoporous membranes using amphiphilic block polymers (PS-b-PEO and PS-b-P4VP) [15], [16]. Several other research groups also discovered that amphiphilic block polymers could also produce nanoporous membranes. Such diblock polymers and triblock polymers were also used to prepare porous membrane such as PS-P2VP [17], P(S-co-I)-b-PDMAEMA [18] and PI-b-PS-b-P4VP [19]. It was barely reported that double hydrophobic block copolymer could form porous membrane by self-assembly. Only Karunakaran et al. [11] utilized NIPS method to prepare the porous membrane with double hydrophobic block copolymer PS-b-PMMA. However, the mechanism of porous membrane formation by using double hydrophobic group block is not clear at the molecular level. Computer simulation is an important means to explain the membrane-forming mechanism of block polymers; it can save experimental costs and time, therefore computer simulation becomes a very important complemental tool.
At present, polymer simulation methods include all-atom molecular dynamics [20], coarse-grained molecular dynamics [21], Monte Carlo [22], [23] and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) [24]. The DPD method applies the coarse-grained model and the soft potential, which is in the mesoscale and consistent with the time scale of polymer self-assembly [25], [26], [27].
So far, DPD has been applied in the field of preparing polymer porous membranes. For example, Tang et al. [28] used DPD to simulate TIPS method to investigate the membrane formation process via PVDF-DPC system. Wang et al. [29] used DPD to simulate the process of pore formation by self-assembly of PS-P4VP block copolymers with the NIPS method. Marques et al. [30] utilized DPD to simulate the solvent exchange process at different polymer concentrations. Johansson et al. [31] used DPD method to simulate the formation process of Nafion polymer membrane and calculate the tortuosity of the membrane.
In this work, DPD simulations are used to study the self-assembly of double hydrophobic block copolymer PS-b-PMMA and the mechanism of pore formation via NIPS. Effects of polymer concentration, block ratio and different solvents on the process of porous membrane formation are investigated. Besides investigating factors affecting the morphology and pore size, the porous membrane formation process and the micro-phase separation mechanism are also studied.
