1.1. Nasal septal deviationThe nasal septum is a separating wall that divides the nasal cavity into two halves [1]. The nasal septum, which is composed of cartilage and bone tissues, provides the underlying structure of the nose and gives its shape [2]. It also plays a significant role in the downward and forward displacement of the maxilla [3], [4]. Enlow [5] stated that the nasal septum is still considered as the symbol for the force that causes displacement of the nasomaxillary complex even if the growth process is multifactorial. On the other hand, Moss et al. [6], [7] advocated that the nasal septum had an only passive role in the displacement of the maxilla and functional matrix mechanism in relation with expanding nasal septum is just responsible for the forward and downward displacement of the maxilla. Therefore, the role of the nasal septum on craniofacial growth is controversial.Nasal septal deviation (NSD), is one of the most common nasal diseases, is defined as the deflection to one or both sides of the bone or septum cartilage at varying degrees [8]. The incidence of NSD has been reported about 19.4%–65% [9], [10] and intrauterine pressures and trauma from birth are regarded as one of the leading reasons for NSD [11]. Even about 80% rate at some degree of deviation has been encountered when adult skulls of more than one ethnicity were evaluated [11]. Analysis of ethnic backgrounds has revealed an increased prevalence of septal deviation in Caucasian children compared to African children [12]. Some researchers have reported that the variation in the incidence is caused by the difference in the definition of the deviations [13]. Stallman et al. [10] classified deviations as mild, moderate, or severe. However, Smith et al. [9] described it as a deflection of more than 4 mm from the midline.From a rhinological aspect, the NSD raises the nasal airway resistance on the affected side and poses a crucial problem that leads to asymmetric airflow in the nasal cavity [14], [15]. Some common dental problems like narrow maxilla and posterior crossbite associated with mouth breathing [16] lead to an increase in rhinological diseases such as upper airway infections, sinusitis, and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome [17], [18]. On the other hand, some controversial studies found no statistically significant relationships between the dimension and the morphology of upper airways and skeletal malocclusion [19].The potential effect of NSD on craniofacial growth in childhood is still a challenging issue. D’Ascanio et al. [20] compared skeletal and dental features in children with chronic nasal-breathing obstruction secondary to NSD and nose-breathing controls in their multicenter cephalometric study. They reported that mouth-breathing children show both skeletal and dental anomalies in comparison to the nose-breathing control group.
1.2. Nasal septal deviation and rapid maxillary expansion treatmentAngell [21] described the mechanical principals of widening the arch using rapid maxillary expansion (RME). Widening the arch is a standard technique to correct the transverse maxillary deficiency of children and adolescents in orthodontic treatment. During the expansion, lateral forces from the RME appliance separate mid-palatal suture [22], affect lateral nasal walls and increase of nasal cavity dimensions [23].The positive effect of RME treatment on NSD was firstly reported in 1975 by Gray [24]. More recently, Farronato et al. [25] and Maspero et al. [26] treated children with a transverse maxillary deficiency with RME and reported a 94% reduction in NSD. Although there are many studies about the effect of RME on the dimensions of the nasal cavity and airway [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], only a few authors evaluated the changes in the nasal septum following to the RME.Furthermore, most studies used two-dimensional (2D) images only, instead of three-dimensional (3D) images, in cephalometric analysis to assess the NSD changes produced by RME in the literature.
1.3. Use of cone-beam computed tomographyCone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is one of the medical imaging techniques based on X-rays. In this technique, the X-rays are applied in different ways to form a conic shape [33]. CBCT has been a very common imaging technique due to its advantageous including reasonably high-quality, relatively lower exposing radiation, low-cost, appreciable easy-to-access among other 3D imaging techniques [35]. From its invention, it takes a substantial role in different applications in the field of implant dentistry [35], endodontics [34], ear-nose-throat [25], [26], [32], [40], [42], orthopedics [36], and interventional radiology (IR) [37], image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) [38], and many other medical applications. Besides, the CBCT has become the gold standard in dentistry. It is very useful in imaging the oral and maxillofacial area [39].Professional dentists can notice maxillary sinuses even in 2D images easily. On the other hand, they are able to capture all sinuses and nasal cavity by using high-quality CBCT scans [41]. Also, they can diagnose anatomic variants of the deviated nasal septum, concha bullosa, and paradoxical turbinate.In a recent review article, the authors investigated the quality of CBCT studies for evaluating the effects of RME treatment on upper airway morphology. They scanned 1088 articles from the literature that are published before the end of 2016. They focused only on CBCT studies based on visualizing the upper airway before and after an RME treatment. The mean quality score of these studies is 50% (ranged from 36% to 68%). They emphasized the inconsistency in CBCT protocols including the head posture, the tongue position, and segmentations. They concluded a requirement of a validated and consistent protocol [32].Shokri et al studied CBCT scans to explain anatomical variations of the nasal cavity and ethmoidal sinuses. They evaluated 250 CBCT scans in their study. They concluded that operating surgeons and radiologists must be careful about the nasal region before the operation to avoid complications after the operation [42]. In another study, Mudgade et al. [40] investigated the existence of anatomic variations in maxillary sinuses. They evaluated CBCT images acquired from 150 subjects. They reported that the precise assessment of maxillary sinuses is very important to prevent non-essential surgical operations [40].
1.4. Aim of the studyThis study aimed to evaluate the changes of NSD following RME, using tortuosity ratio measured from three-dimensional (3D) images that are acquired by a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT). For this purpose, we developed a novel Matlab application to analyze 3D images and constituted the null hypothesis as there was no significant effect (or difference) of RME treatment on the degree of NSD.
