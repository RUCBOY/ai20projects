A machine-identifiable temporary optical signal that is only present in crop plants and not weeds can enable rapid differentiation of crops from weeds for robotic weeding applications. Compounds such as sulfate are mobile in the plant after absorption by the roots and can be transport up into the foliage (Lappartient et al., 1999). The properties of compounds such as molecular weight, and lipophilicity as represented by the octanol water partition coefficient (log Kow), influence their permeability and uptake in plants (Inoue et al., 1998, Salanenka and Taylor, 2006, Satchivi, 2014). Compounds with intermediate polarity (log Kow = 0–2) are readily transported through the plant xylem to the shoot (Briggs et al., 1982, Hsu et al., 1990). A compound that has a unique optical appearance and can be detected in trace amounts in plants is desirable. Fluorescent tracers contain fluorophores that can be excited by specific wavelengths. Upon excitation, very low doses of fluorophores produce significant fluorescence emissions. Rhodamine B (Rh-B) (Water solubility = 20 g/L at 15 °C, Log Kow = 1.5, molar mass = 479, excitation/emission at 555/582 nm) is a fluorescent xanthene dye which has been included on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 4B list (conforming to 40 CFR 180.2020). According to the EPA, Rh-B (not to exceed 60 ppm on the treated seed and 2% by weight of the formulated product) is exempt from food use tolerance because it is unlikely to cause residues in food or on food, under section 180.2020 of 40 CFR Ch. I (7–1–07 Edition, the Code of Federal Regulations). The EPA has concluded that the current use of Rh-B at this level does not adversely affect the environment or public health.
Computer vision is capable of analyzing digital image information to determine food authenticity or to perform automated plant care tasks (Pu et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2019; Alwaseela et al., 2019; Su et al., 2019d; Su et al., 2019b; Su et al., 2019a; Lee et al., 1999; Su and Sun, 2016; Sun, 2000; Slaughter et al., 2008; Su et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2012b). The main bottleneck limiting the widespread application of automatic weed control systems in modern agriculture is the lack of universal and robust smart sensing methods to rapidly identify crops in the field. Automatic sensing of crops grown in an agricultural field typically involves sensing living plants against a background of bare soil or soil and plant debris (Tian and Slaughter, 1998). A common method of measuring crop identity is to develop fast non-contact spectroscopic sensors (Yang et al., 2012; Su and Sun, 2019; Su et al., 2019c; Khaled et al., 2018, Li et al., 1997, Liang et al., 2015, Tiwari et al., 2013). In addition to the spectral characteristics, image features can be incorporated into the sensing process to create a high spatial resolution crop and weed map to fully understand the spatial information of the surrounding environment. Hyperspectral images consisting of a large number of consecutive spectral wavelengths can be used for on-line detection (Su and Sun, 2016a, Zhang et al., 2012a), but it takes a lot of effort to identify the target specimen (Su and Sun, 2016b; Su and Sun, 2016; Su and Sun, 2017; Su et al., 2017; Su and Sun, 2017; Gao et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2019). For instance, Zhang et al. (2012b) developed a weeding robot equipped with a hyperspectral camera to kill weeds in real-time from a moving tractor, but the tractor travel speed was constrained by the hyperspectral sensing system.
Using spectral imaging with band-pass filters is a promising method for automated assessment of specimens containing fluorescent signals (Blackburn et al., 2011, Larsson et al., 2017, Su and Sun, 2018a, Su and Sun, 2018b). Specifically, an effective imaging method based on ultraviolet (UV) radiation was developed to identify fluorescent compounds directly applied to tomato stems and lettuce leaves (Nguyen et al., 2017, Vuong et al., 2017). Similarly, a seed treatment technique combined with the image recognition system successfully visualized the translocation of Rh-B within snap bean stems, allowing automatic differentiation of crop plants from weeds (Su et al., 2019e). Varying doses of Rh-B solutions were compared (0.001, 0.01, 1, 5 g l−1). The highest fluorescence emission was observed for the seeds treated with Rh-B solution of 0.1 g l−1 (Su et al., 2019f). However, they found that the Rh-B signal was not transported beyond the snap bean stems into the leaves when applied to the exterior of the ungerminated seed. As material passage of a compound through the seed coat varies among plant species, it is necessary to apply the signaling material to the root system rather than the seed coat in many vegetable crops (Wu et al., 2013). To produce the strongest fluorescent signal without phytotoxicity, it is necessary to optimize the dose of Rh-B dye. The fluorescence intensity of plants treated with the same dose of Rh-B could be significantly different if the pretreatment method of plant root was different. Besides UV light, green light can also be used to excite Rh-B (Field, 2002, Han et al., 2003). Furthermore, the photostability of fluorescent compounds is essential for applications that involve lengthy exposure of the material to light (Eggeling et al., 1998). Rh-B is subject to photodegradation as UV and visible light combined with oxygen in the air degrade Rh-B (Qu et al., 1998, Watanabe et al., 1977). According to the known degradation mechanisms, Wilhelm and Stephan (2007) demonstrated that Rh-B could be completely degraded due to a complete disappearance of organic carbon. Nevertheless, Rh-B is still considered a promising systemic tracer as it is detectable in live animals for many weeks. For example, the persistence of the Rh-B (62 to 108 ppm) lasted for at least 6 weeks in the hair of dosed stoats and beavers (Lindsey, 1983, Spurr, 2002). As solar irradiation can cause significant signal decay over time (Song et al., 1995), it is necessary to characterize the susceptibility of systemic Rh-B in plant tissues to photodegradation in full sunlight during the 3 to 5 week period after planting during the critical period of weed removal. Additionally, it is essential to document the impacts of using the Rh-B tracer on plant health and vigor because of the cytotoxicity of high doses of fluorescent compounds (O'brien et al., 2000).
The focus of this study was to investigate whether Rh-B would be a suitably persistent and a reliable systemic crop signaling compound for celery in the field using root uptake. Specific objectives were (1) development of a method for the application of a systemic crop signaling compound to celery plants through the root system, (2) evaluation of the effects of a range of Rh-B doses on root uptake and crop biomass, (3) assessment of the photostability of the crop signaling compound in full sunlight. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the photobleaching, stability and persistence of a signaling compound in celery under sunlight.
