As per the latest release of NCBI RefSeq (July 2019), whole genomes for 93,618 organisms have been reported (including eukaryotes, prokaryotes and viruses) which can be accessed from the NCBI Genome portal (Fig. 1A) (Agarwala et al., 2016, O’Leary et al., 2016). It is also observed that out of 146,381,777 proteins with sequence information, only 154,243 proteins have structural information available at Protein Data Bank (Berman, 2000, Burley et al., 2019) (Fig. 1B), which creates approximately thousand fold gap between the sequence and structure availability of proteins. Existence of more than 12,000 diseases worldwide (Smith et al., 2014, WHO, 2017) and an annual increase of hundreds of new diseases is alarming and demands immediate attention. However, to combat this huge number of diseases, only 2,595 FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved small drug molecules are available in the market as per the release of DrugBank (version 5.1.4, released in July 2019) (Wishart et al., 2018). The recent FDA statistics highlight the fact that very few drugs reach the market per year (Fig. 1C) (Food and Drug Adiministration (FDA), 2018, Food and Drug Adiministration (FDA), 2016, Piepho, 2000), while there is always an exponential mandate for newer drugs because of the faster mutation rates of pathogens as well as microbial drug resistance (Fig. 1D). In the current scenario, on an average, each approved drug takes about 14 years from the conception to the market and costs approximately $2.6 billion (Food and Drug Adiministration (FDA), 2016). Recent developments in the computational approaches have however shown a promise to reduce the time and cost along with improved efficiencies in the drug discovery process (Cushman et al., 1977, Dragovich et al., 1998, Ekins, 2006, Greer et al., 1994, Marshall, 1987, Song et al., 2009, Talele et al., 2010, Vacca and Condra, 1997, von Itzstein et al., 1993).Download : Download high-res image (406KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Currently. there are tools available for various steps of computer aided drug discovery such as GeneMark (Borodovsky and McIninch, 1993), Glimmer (Salzberg et al., 1998), EasyGene (Larsen and Krogh, 2003), Genscan (Burge and Karlin, 1997), etc. for gene prediction; I-TASSER (Yang et al., 2015), Raptor (Kelley et al., 2015), BhageerathH (Jayaram et al., 2014), Swiss-Model (Biasini et al., 2014), etc. for protein tertiary prediction and AutoDock (Morris et al., 2009), Gold (Jones et al., 1997), etc. for virtual screening and docking studies, yet the need for a consolidated platform cannot be over emphasized. Current methods of genome annotation are mostly based on training against known genomes/genes and thus fail to deliver the expected results in the cases where no prior experimental knowledge is available. Similarly, in the absence of known homolog protein structure in the protein databank, the purely homology-based methods are usually unable to furnish reliable predictions. Likewise, if no biochemical information is available on the protein targets such as their active or functional sites, structure-based drug discovery cannot be initiated. The recent methodological developments in the field of target identification and drug repurposing are achieved maily through implementation of machine learning and artificial intelligence related techniques (Donner et al., 2018, Ekins et al., 2019, Tanoli et al., 2018, Zeng et al., 2020). However, while delivering improved results, these methods fail to provide insights into the underlying principles. Also, the over reliance of these methods on the training datasets restricts their utility in completely novel cases. The question remains as to how one can then proceed to clear the pathogen expeditiously. Considering the situation, the Genome to Drug (G2D) pathway (named as Dhanvantari) presented here, provides a promising viable solution. Its genome annotation methods, protein structure prediction algorithm, binding pocket determination, hit molecule identification methods are based on physicochemical principles which guarantee success even under extreme conditions. The computational modules used in the Dhanvantari pipeline address the major bottlenecks by not relying entirely upon the availablity of experimental knowledge. Each of the modules in the pipeline is thoroughly validated and can be used independently or in a pipeline. The pipeline can also accommodate the best predictions from other servers/research groups for gene finding, protein tertiary structure prediction, binding pocket determination, etc. to deliver hit molecules.
