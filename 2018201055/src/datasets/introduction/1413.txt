The present quick increment in applications, for example, high definition video streaming, interactive media applications, web browsing, broadband cell, social media, and so forth are highly data-intensive and resource-hungry, giving rise to a new sort of challenge called spectrum scarcity to provide high data rate services to a large number of users [1], [2]. The other contributing factor for the shortage of spectrum is the current inflexible frequency allocation systems with no dynamism in the manner and way regulatory agencies allocate spectrum to PUs [3]. Due to the fixed frequency allocation systems and exponential growth in the number of wireless devices, services, and applications, it is difficult to allocate spectrums for newly emerging technologies [4].
However, the trials by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC) demonstrate that at any given time and area, much (somewhere in the range of 80% to 90%) of the licensed spectrum is underutilized [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Such temporarily unused spectrum slots are called spectrum holes, resulting in spectral wastefulness. Subsequently, the development of new wireless applications might be hindered, including broadband access, public safety, health care, and business [10]. So as to alleviate the impact of these two causative factors of spectrum scarcity, the cognitive radio (CR) system is recommended that allows utilization of primary (licensed) user's radio spectrum again and again by secondary (unlicensed) users, as far as secondary users (SUs) do not cause any harmful interference to the primary users (PUs) in that frequency bands. This property of re-usability makes the radio spectrum a high-valued commodity with the capacity of permitting an enormous number of simultaneous users to benefit from it [3], [11].
CR is a smart wireless communication system. To accomplish the desired smartness, the principal challenge is spectrum sensing (SS) that the SUs achieve the awareness about the portion of a licensed spectrum that is not being utilized by PUs before opportunistically utilizing the temporally idle frequency [12]. Fundamentally, there are two types of SS depending on their bandwidth: narrowband SS and wideband SS [8]. Narrowband SS enables a SU to sense one narrowband channel just in one sensing period and decide in that specific slice of the spectrum whether the PU is available or absent [3], [13]. Since the next age of communication systems require high data rate and bandwidth, the convectional narrowband SS methods are impractical. On the other hand, wideband SS scans multiple channels over a wide frequency range to discover more spectral opportunities to improve spectrum efficiency. However, the Shannon-Nyquist theorem states that to guarantee the recovery of the signals from a set of uniformly spaced samples, the signal must be sampled at a rate which is at least twice the bandwidth of the signal. As the spectrum bandwidth gets wider, the amount of data acquired by sensing system grows significantly, which needs a very high-speed analog-to-digital convector (ADC) that is excessively costly, requires complicated hardware implementation that is even physically impossible to build devices capable of acquiring samples at that necessary rate for power-constrained SUs [8], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18].
The narrowband spectrum sensing techniques cannot be straightforwardly utilized for performing wideband SS [8]. Several types of approaches have been proposed to perform wideband SS. The first method was using reconfigurable bandpass filters by dividing the wideband spectrum into several narrow bands and perform sensing sequentially. This method requires a considerable sensing time to cover a broad spectrum. Due to this, the sensing delay in the process will decrease the data transmission time and subsequently results in less throughput for SUs [8], [9], [11]. Another solution is to utilize a bank of parallel narrowband filters with different center frequencies to simultaneously sense multiple frequency bands and perform joint detection. This technique provides faster sensing as compared to a reconfigurable bandpass filter-based system. However, this method requires a large number of radio frequency (RF) front-end components, which increases the size of the receiver and the power consumption of the SU during SS [11], [12].
However, the samples obtained at or above the Nyquist rate are not fully needed to represent a signal in light of the fact that, from this tremendous acquired samples, a significant portion is immediately discarded and relatively a few important ones are stored at the compression stage. In order to eliminate the collection of unnecessary samples, the compressive sensing (CS) method is proposed that combines compression with signal acquisition step [17], [18], [19]. CS technique provides the capability to recover the signal from fewer samples or measurements than the conventional approach of reconstructing a signal from acquired data which is governed by the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem [16], [19], [20], [21]. Therefore, the primary challenge in CR is spectrum sensing, in which the SUs achieve the awareness about the portion of a licensed spectrum that is not being used by PUs.
In conventional data acquisition system, all samples of the original spectrum are acquired. For the wideband spectrum, this number of spectrum samples can be in the order of torrent. This acquisition process is followed by compression, which exploits the redundancy in the signal to express in a space where most signal coefficients can be discarded with little or no loss in information. Notwithstanding, because of the practical limitations on the capabilities of SU's receiver hardware components, for the most part, ADC, it is hard to implement a wideband spectrum sensing algorithm in practice. Hence, in the conventional acquisition system, we initially acquire a considerable amount of data in which a significant portion is immediately discarded at the compression stage. This creates significant wastefulness in SU during SS. Compressive sensing tends to reduce this wastefulness by successfully combining the acquisition and compression processes simultaneously. Therefore, in this paper, the SS is employed to sense the wideband spectrum in one sensing period in CR by using CS.
CR is capable of acquiring various RF parameters to become aware of its surrounding radio environment. This can be accomplished with SS. Several spectrum sensing algorithms have been proposed in the literature. However, none of them fully satisfy the requirements of all associated measurements, for example, efficiency, implementation complexity, reliability, and secondary system throughput degradation [22].
Cyclostationary detection is a powerful spectrum sensing technique which relies on the built-in periodicity of modulated signal since they are coupled with sine wave carriers, repeating spreading code sequence or cyclic prefixes where noise has no spectral correlation. By utilizing this property, PU signals are easily differentiated from noise [23], [24], [25], [26]. Hence, this method is robust to noise uncertainty (NU). It exhibits high computational complexity. Furthermore, cyclostationary-based SS is sensitive to cyclic frequency mismatch, and it has to know the PU transmission, pulse-shaping filter, and roll-off factor, which are not easy to know in real-world scenarios [2], [11], [22], [27].
Another spectrum sensing technique is matched filter detection which is obtained by correlating the received signal with priorly known spectral features of the primary signal. In this technique, the detection needs less time to accomplish high processing task because of the coherent nature of the matched filter processing. However, a matched filter detection requires the SUs to have the exact copy of PU signals that may not be available in a real-world situations. Moreover, for coherence detection, the SUs require a dedicated receiver for licensed users which increases its complexity and it is a significant challenge for an enormous number of PUs [23], [24], [25], [26].
Eigenvalue-based advanced spectrum detecting techniques were proposed to overcome the impact of NU on the performance of the sensing [23], [24]. However, because of the required calculation of the received signals' covariance matrix and its eigenvalues, these techniques involve exceptionally high computational complexity [27].
The most widely recognized and a non-coherent way of SS is energy detection, that CR receiver does not need to know any information of the PU's signals, and it has simple hardware realization. However, the detection threshold is highly sensitive to the NU, which degrades its performance under low SNR levels. Effective SS technique needs to identify weak primary signals in view of multipath fading and shadowing phenomena, which results in power fluctuation of received PU signals [2], [11], [13], [22], [23], [24], [26], [27]. An alternative method, maximum-minimum subband energy detection based spectrum sensing technique, was proposed which is efficient and robust. It has low computational complexity, which utilizes the subband decomposition of the received signal and the difference of maximum and minimum subband energy as a test statistic. This method gives an acceptable performance at the low SNR regime with NU by viewing the minimum subband energy as an estimation for a noise variance [22], [27].
In this paper, CS-based maximum-minimum subband energy detection is proposed to enable reliable and fast sensing of the wideband spectrum. The proposed spectrum sensing technique utilizes the sparse nature of wideband signals in the frequency domain on the ground that at any time and geographical area, only a few percentages of total available channels are occupied by PUs. In this manner, the CS-based spectrum sensing technique acquires wideband signals using sampling rates lower than the Nyquist rate and detects potentially vacant spectral bands using these compressed measurements. In other words, this method replaces multiple parallel narrowband ADC or reconfigurable bandpass filters by a single ADC based spectrum sensing technique.
So as to utilize the benefits of CR communication efficiently, a CR should have the capability to monitor the surrounding radio environment over a broad spectrum range. This environmental learning over a wideband range helps to apply a versatile resource allocation and spectrum utilization techniques for the powerful utilization of the underutilized radio spectrum. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
•The proposed spectrum sensing method achieves higher performance than the existing energy detection methods.•The impact of different parameters, such as number of active PUs, NU factor, and number of measurements (compression ratio of CS), on maximum-minimum subband energy detection performance are thoroughly investigated both analytically and using simulations.•The effect of decreasing the number of measurements on spectrum sensing time of the proposed technique is also studied.
