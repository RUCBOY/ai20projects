For n∈N, let [n]:={0,1,…,n−1}. A function class1 C is a collection of Boolean functions on [n], that is, C⊆[2][n].
A central question of learning theory is: how much data is required to learn an unknown function f⁎,
given that f⁎ is in some known function class C? Here, to learn f⁎ means to identify some function fˆ∈C such that fˆ is identical to f⁎ except on a small subset2 of [n].
The classical answer to the question above is given by the VC dimension.
Definition 1.1We say a subset U⊆[n] is shattered by C if every function on U is a restriction of some function in C. The VC dimension (Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension) [16] of C isdimVC⁡C:=max⁡{|U||U is shattered by C}.
For more than 40 years since its introduction, the VC dimension has occupied center-stage in learning theory and other analytically-flavored branches of computer science. It is a celebrated theorem in classical learning theory that the number of samples needed to learn an unknown function in C is proportional to dimVC⁡C; we point to [10] for precise statements and more details on learning theory.
In this paper, we continue the study of the learning theoretic properties of C using invariants of homological nature introduced by the third author [18]. There is a natural simplicial complex ◇C associated to a function class C, called the suboplex of C. We consider the Stanley-Reisner ideal IC of ◇C as well as its dual ideal IC⋆ — see §2 for details. One can then analyze the learning theoretic properties of C by drawing upon the vast literature on squarefree monomial ideals.
Theorem 1.2[18, Theorem 3.11] Define the homological dimension dimh⁡C of a function class C as the projective dimension of IC⋆, i.e. dimh⁡C:=projdimIC⋆. ThendimVC⁡C≤dimh⁡C.
The two quantities dimVC and dimh can be different, but they do coincide for many function classes of importance in computer science [18, Section 3.1], such as the class of parity functions, the class of polynomial threshold functions, or the class of monotone conjunctions. Our goal in this paper is two-fold: (i) to investigate the multigraded Betti numbers of IC⋆, and (ii) to identify new large families of function classes for which dimVC and dimh coincide or approximately coincide.
Our main cases of interest are function classes with suitable semi-lattice structures. Let P be a subposet of the lattice of subsets of [n] that is intersection-closed (see §4). We consider the function class C(P) defined by P by identifying subsets of [n] with their indicator functions as in [9]. Function classes arising in this way include:
•conjunctions (logical AND) of parity functions (i.e. conjunctions of linear functionals over F2), and more generally the lattice of flats of a matroid (see §5.1 and §6.3),•downward-closed classes, and more generally the face poset of a polyhedral cell complex (see §5.2), and•the class of k-CNFs (conjunctive normal forms) and the class of CSPs (constraint satisfaction problems) (see §6.2).
Our main result is a construction of an explicit free resolution of the ideal IC(P)⋆ via the order complex ΔP of P. We refer to §3 and §4 for the relevant definitions and notation.
Theorem 4.3Let P⊆2[n] be an intersection-closed poset, and S the polynomial ring of the ideal IC(P)⋆. Denote by F(ΔP) the cellular chain complex of free S-modules arising from the order complex ΔP of P, with vertices labeled by minimal generators of IC(P)⋆. Then F(ΔP) is acyclic and hence gives an S-free resolution of S/IC(P)⋆.
As a consequence, we obtain the multigraded Betti numbers of IC(P)⋆ purely in terms of the poset topology of P.
Theorem 4.4Let P⊆2[n] be an intersection-closed poset. Then the nonzero multigraded Betti numbers of IC(P)⋆ occur precisely in the degrees of certain monomials denoted m(A,B) associated to each A≤B∈P (see Definition 3.4), and in these degrees,βi,m(A,B)(IC(P)⋆)=dimk⁡H˜i−2(Δ‾[A,B];k),∀i≥1 where Δ‾[A,B] denotes the truncated order complex of the interval [A,B] (Definition 3.2).
Corollary 4.6Let P⊆2[n] be an intersection-closed poset. Then dimh⁡C(P)≤rank(P).
If furthermore all (open) intervals of P are Cohen-Macaulay (in which case we say P is interval Cohen-Macaulay), as is the case when P arises from a matroid or a polyhedral cell complex, then the multigraded Betti numbers of IC(P)⋆ are pure and can be described combinatorially by the Möbius function of P (see §5).
Theorem 5.5Let P⊆2[n] be an intersection-closed poset that is interval Cohen-Macaulay, and μP(⋅,⋅) the Möbius function of the poset P. Then (with m(A,B) as in Theorem 4.4),βi,m(A,B)(IC(P)⋆)={|μP(A,B)|ifrank([A,B])=i0otherwise.
For example, when P=PM is the lattice of flats of a matroid M, the quantity μP(F,G) for F⊆G∈P is known as the Möbius number of the matroid minor M|G/F. When P=PX is the face poset of a polyhedral cell complex X, then the quantity μP(F,G) for F⊆G∈P is the reduced Euler characteristic of the boundary complex of a polytope, which is always ±1.
In section §6, we apply our tools to give bounds for the VC dimension of various function classes of importance in learning theory, such as the class of k-CNFs, the class of D-CSPs, the class of conjunctions of parity functions, and more generally the class of conjunctions of polynomials over F2 (see §6 for definitions of these classes).
Theorem 6.3Let C be the class of k-CNFs and let C+ be the class of monotone k-CNFs in d variables. ThenΩ(dk)≤dimVC⁡C+≤dimh⁡C+≤O(dk)Ω(dk)≤dimVC⁡C≤dimh⁡C≤O(dk), where Ω and O hides constants dependent on k but independent of d.
Corollary 6.8 & 6.9Homological dimension and VC dimension coincide for the class of conjunctions of parity functions. The same holds more generally for conjunctions of degree-bounded polynomials over F2.
