Multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) [1] are currently one of the fastest growing areas in computing. An extensive increase in the size of the chip and the number of transistors per unit area allows developing chips with tens and hundreds of processor cores even now. At the same time, the problem of effective organization of a communication subsystem that would ensure quick data exchange between nodes of such NoCs is becoming urgent [2].
Since communication is carried out within the framework of a single chip, laws and principles that exist in telecommunication networks work differently in NoCs; therefore, the development of new solutions and methods for organizing data transfer in such networks is required. In particular, it is the topology that has a significant impact on NoC performance. The most common are classical regular topologies such as mesh [3] and torus [4], which do not always meet modern requirements for NoCs, especially with an increase in the number of nodes [5]. Different researchers suggest other topology options among which we can distinguish hypercube [6, 7, 8], chordal ring [9, 10], spidergon [11], L-networks [12]. Their feature is that they can be reduced to presentation in the form of ring-like graphs called circulant topologies in the general form. Optimal circulants have several significant advantages over mesh and torus topologies â€“ better structural survivability, reliability, and connectivity [13, 14]. Moreover, the mathematical aspects of the theory of circulant graphs are studied quite well; such families of graphs as recursive circulants [15], multiplicative circulants [16], ring circulants [14] having quite interesting properties are known. The previously mentioned topologies (hypercube, chordal ring, etc.), in theory, are also close to circulant topologies and often are a special case of circulant subfamily, but of a holistic consideration of circulant networks as topologies for developing NoCs has not been fully made before. It is necessary to study circulant topologies and routing algorithms in them taking into account the chip resources necessary to implement such NoCs.
