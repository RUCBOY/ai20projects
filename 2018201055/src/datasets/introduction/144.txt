This study explores the differential influences of targeted features of instructional software for intentional multimedia vocabulary learning. To achieve this, it investigates multimedia coding elements with potential for a differential impact on second language vocabulary acquisition (SLA) by connecting computer-assisted language learning (CALL) software design to theoretically grounded SLA research. The majority of SLA studies involving adults (with several exceptions, e.g. Klein & Dimroth, 2009; Gullberg, Roberts, & Dimroth, 2012) have investigated intermediate L2 learner’s abilities in terms of processing or developing linguistic representations. Unlike that majority of research, the current study controls for the influence of pre-existing linguistic knowledge, by choosing participants with no background in the L2. The intention was being to capture the abilities of learners when they encounter an L2 that is typologically distant. The participants were exposed to Arabic vocabulary as a foreign language (AFL) via the Computer-Assisted Vocabulary Acquisition software (CAVA) via three interactive interfaces in a multimedia CALL environment: a verbal-based menu driven interface (L2-L1: MDI), a visual-based graphical user interface (L2-Picture: GUI) and a visuospatial-based zoomable user interface (L2-Context: ZUI). To the best of the researchers’ knowledge, ZUI is used here for the first time in field of vocabulary CALL, and is presented alongside CAVA as an instructional software tool for intentional multimedia vocabulary learning designed by the researchers. Therefore, this study will add to the body of knowledge by exploring the effective features of three multimedia representations to provide further insight to improve CALL design.
