Because of significant strength and low-cost production, mild steel is one of the most favorable alloys in abundant industrial applications. On the other way, the high active surface can make undesirable destructive reactions via aggressive environments [1]. Recently, different strategies are taken into consideration for controlling the metals’ degradation rate against corrosion attacks [2], [3], [4]. Due to high-cost efficiency and acceptable inhibition performance, corrosion inhibitors were utilized dramatically in different applications.
Generally, the heteroatoms, that exist in most of the organic materials play an essential role in their inhibition behavior [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. The recently carried out researches results proved that the chrome/lead-based inhibitors, despite the high inhibition action, they are useless in recent days due to the significant toxicity [10], [11], [12], [13]. Besides, most of the organic inhibitors can only provide considerable protection in acidic environments and are not effective inhibiting materials in chloride-based solutions (pHs near to 7).
Recently, the organic inhibitors were employed for controlling the metal aggression in neutral environments, i.e., wastewater industries, heat exchangers, boilers, and different oil/gas equipment become a hot topic for researchers [14], [15], [16].
Scientific reports from Han et al. demonstrated the undesirable ability of 12-sodium alkyl sulfate against corrosion retardation of mild steel in saline environments. Based on the EIS spectroscopy results, by dissolving 100 ppm of 12-sodium alkyl sulfate an only 36% efficiency is reached [17]. In the other work, the GLU molecules inhibition potency was investigated by electrochemical (i.e., Tafel and EIS) approaches. The Tafel and EIS achievements proved that after dissolving 250 ppm of GLU, about 79%, and 73% values of corrosion retardation degrees are achieved, respectively [18]. The corrosive prevention property of the imidazoline was investigated by Qian and Chen [19]. Outcomes illustrated that after introducing 150 ppm of imidazoline, the corrosion attacks were suppressed by 81% degree after 168 h subjection of iron to the aggressive chloride solution. Observations from Tabatabaei et al. research demonstrated that by dissolving 800 ppm extract of Eucalyptus leaves, 75% of the aggression retardation was reached in the harsh neutral environment [20]. In the same study, ATMP was employed as an organic inhibitor in a NaCl based solution. Final reports indicated a 70% protection degree after enhancing 800 ppm ATMP in the environment [21].
As mentioned before, most of the organic-based inhibiting molecules could not provide a high degree of corrosion retardation in near-neutral chloride, including media. In order to improve the inhibition effect of the organic-based molecules, one practical/promising strategy would be combining them with inorganic metal cations [22]. In general, the heteroatoms related lone electron pairs can make string links with the vacant-orbital of the most of inorganic elements (i.e., Zn (II), Ce (III) and Sm (III)). After complexion, the organic part can cover the anodic micro-sites, and the active cathodic micro-sites can be protected via the inorganic part [23]. In other words, the dissolution/damage rate of the metal can be diminished from aggressive ions attacks by a mixed protection route.
Outcomes from Han et al. study displayed that using 4-mercaptopyridine (200 ppm), the mild steel corrosion activities in 3.5%-NaCl media can be lowered by a 98% degree. After chelating 12-sodium alkyl sulfate via 4-mercaptopyridine (1:1 wt%) the protection degree was enhanced to 99% [17]. According to Aslam et al., research the pure potassium iodide (100 ppm): GLU (250 ppm) hybrid complexes can control the metallic substrate damage rate against corrosive attacks by 82% degree [18]. The synergistic effect of imidazoline and sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate was evaluated by Qian and Chen. The evidence disclosed that 150 ppm of sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate could diminish only 16% of the chloride solution aggression. However, after using 50:150 ppm imidazoline: sodium dodecylbenzene sulphonate, the protection performance was enhanced to 88%. Scientific reports demonstrated that the pure Zn (II) ions provide 89% protection in saline solution [19]. After combining the 200:600 ppm, the Eucalyptus leaves extract: Zn, a hybrid layer with a 90% inhibition rate, was constructed on the active iron sites during 48 h exposure to 3.5%-NaCl media [20]. In another study, the EIS spectroscopy measurements proved 85% efficiency of 800 ppm Sm (III) during 48 h steel immersion in saline media. On the other side, after dissolving 600:200 ppm ATMP:Sm mixture in the solution, the enhancement of the corrosion inhibition to 88% was attained [21].
Nowadays, the toxic nature of chromatic/nitric base of inhibitors was proved by different studies. For this reason, the green inhibitors, i.e., biopolymers [24], ionic liquids [25], plant-based extracts[26], and green base inhibitors [27], were employed as organic inhibitors in chloride solution.
After polyphenols flavonoid group extraction, Quercetin can be obtained. Scientific researches have demonstrated that Quercetin can be significantly found in green tea, raw onions, berries, and ginkgo extracts. Medical applications of Quercetin was proved by various literature [28], [29]. Achievements displayed the high presence of heteroatoms that can make desirable chemical interactions via electron donation mechanism [30], [31]. Simply, high O element concentration causes chemical interactions via Fe empty orbitals that can help Quercetin adsorption on the metallic substrate.
In the recent paper, the function of corrosion-damage protection of Quercetin:Zn was evaluated by electrochemical investigations. The protection capacity of the Quercetin:Zn based deposited complexes over the metal surface was proved by Tafel curves, and the inhibition degree was displayed by the EIS technique. Additionally, the surface structure was visualized by and high-magnification FE-SEM images. The surface elemental structure was demonstrated by EDS/Mapping and GIXRD experiments. The surface nature against water contact was analyzed by contact angle (using pure water) approach. The complexes structure was characterized by FT-IR, and the absorption spectra of the constructed complexes were displayed by UV-Vis diagrams. To complement the aforementioned experiments, various theoretical assessments relying on DFT calculation associated with atomic modelings (MC and MD) were utilized so as to attain microscopic-level insights into the complexes/metal interactions.
