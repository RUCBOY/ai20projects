Electroencephalography (EEG), although introduced a long time ago, continues to be one of the first-line techniques both for the detection and prediction of neurological problems, such as epilepsy and sleep disorders, as well as for Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI) applications [1], [2], [3]. EEG signals are frequently contaminated by artifacts and noise, stemmed from physiological (e.g., eye blinks and movements, muscle, and cardiac contractions) and non-physiological (e.g., power line interference and high-frequency noise from the surrounding environment) sources [4]. The presence of such artifacts might lead to an erroneous analysis of the brain activity, especially for the long-term EEG monitoring or autonomous BCI systems, where the noise contribution is random and signal quality cannot be supervised by a human expert [5]. Thus, the automatic elimination of EEG artifacts is crucial before further processing and analysis.
Recently, simplified EEG headbands with few number of channels have gained attention as such sensors enable ambulatory EEG acquisition and monitoring [6], [7], [8]. Ambulatory-recorded EEG signals are, however, susceptible to more non-physiological artifacts than in clinic records [9]. While a simple linear filter could remove the majority of these artifacts, some require more advanced techniques as they may appear in all EEG frequency bands [10]. Amongst them are electrical shift (i.e., baseline discontinuity) and linear trend artifacts (ESLT), which may arise due to the electrode shifts or a temporary declining of the skin-electrode contact, induced current transients drifts, and electrical pop [11], [12], [13], [14].
Unfortunately, the elimination of ESLT artifacts from EEG signals has not been widely regarded in the recent literature [10], [15], [16], [17]. Three Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithms named Infomax, SOBI, and FastICA, were firstly presented for EEG denoising with satisfactory ESLT removal [13]. Later, two fully automatic algorithms based on the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and ICA, known as Automatic Wavelet Independent Component Analysis (AWICA) [11] and Enhanced AWICA (EAWICA) [14], were proposed for the filtering of several types of EEG artifacts including ESLTs. ICA based-algorithms cannot automatically reject the contaminated components and require several artifact markers to separate them from clean ones. Artifact markers in such algorithms are usually pre-trained and are not adaptive to other databases [18]. In addition, mentioned algorithm are computationally expensive, which is not favorable for ambulatory or semi-real time applications [10], [13], [17].
A multi-channel Wiener filter is an alternative approach to filter ESLT artifacts from EEG signals [19]. Although it outperformed Infomax ICA, FastICA and Canonical Component Analysis (CCA) algorithms, the mentioned algorithm needs initial calibration; the user is required to mark some of artifactual and non-artifactual segments manually to train the algorithm. Recently, Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR) algorithm has been proposed for automatic elimination of artifacts in EEG signals, tackling the initial calibration and manual setting of the artifact markers [18]. ASR’s performance, however, relies on sufficient amount of EEG data and cannot be employed for the single EEG channel.
Proposed algorithms for ESLT removal, albeit with satisfactory performance, were designed for either offline or multi-channel EEG processing. Thus, efficient algorithms for automatic removal of ESLT in short segment (i.e., 5s) of single-to-few EEG channels, suitable for portable and low-cost systems are yet lacking. The objective of this paper is to propose an automatic low-complexity algorithm for ESLT filtering, applicable for single-to-few EEG channels. For this aim, wavelet-based (WT) algorithms can be suitable as they overcome the requirement of initial calibration, several pre-trained artifact markers, and large amount of EEG channels for filtering. While effectiveness of WT-based approaches has been demonstrated for EEG signal denoising [17], [20], [21], [22], their use for elimination of ESLT artifacts in EEG signals have not been explored or validated in literature.
Amongst WT algorithms, Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) is more effective than DWT for EEG preprocessing since it is time invariant and provides a better time resolution for the artifact characterization. Thus, a smoother EEG is derived after thresholding in the wavelet domain [23], [24]. One of the main challenges in the SWT-based denoising algorithm is to select optimal level of the decomposition, as EEG signals sampled at different rates may require different number of decomposition levels [10], [15], [16], [17]. The most straightforward strategy is to use full tree decomposition of the contaminated signal and then filter the artifactual components. However, such strategy yields unnecessary computational burdens. To avoid fully decomposition, we introduce a new kurtosis-based strategy for automatic adjustment of the optimal decomposition level of SWT, regardless of sampling frequency. Using such a strategy can avoid unnecessary decomposition, make the algorithm automatic, and accelerate filtering. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm is validated on EEG signals recorded at different sampling rates and compared to the performance of AWICA and EAWICA algorithms.
