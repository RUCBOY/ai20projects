Diverse heart disease affects the lives of millions, and this disease is the leading cause of death. As people get older, they have more probability of suffering heart disease. The United Nations calculated that the number of people aged 60 years would increase by 56% in 2030 [1]. The name of the medical test that detects heart abnormalities is electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG measures the electrical activity of the heart through electrodes attached on the skin. The electrodes can be attached in different parts of the body; the most common configuration uses five electrodes [2]; other configuration uses ten electrodes [3]; these configurations measure the electrical signal. Different settings could be applied, so many kinds of leads could be created. The most common are; Lead I, Lead II, and Lead III.
Fig. 1 shows the ECG of Normal Rhythm; the waves on the ECG correspond electrical phenomena on the heart surface. P wave represents the Atrial depolarization. The QRS complex wave represents the Ventricular depolarization and the Atrial repolarization, while T wave represents the Ventricular polarization. When the electrical heart signals do not work correctly, the waveforms on the ECG change, then we know that an arrhythmia is present.Download : Download high-res image (99KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

The term arrhythmia means any change in the electrical activity of the heart. This activity may happen fast, slowly, or erratically, thus the heart beats fast, slowly or erratically. Some people experiment in irregular heartbeats, which may feel like a racing heart or fluttering. Many arrhythmias are harmless, but if they occur in a damaged heart or they are severely abnormal, these arrhythmias could be dangerous. Arrhythmias consist of an early beat (premature contraction), slow beat (bradycardia), fast beat (tachycardia), and irregular beat (fibrillation or flutter).
The arrhythmias produce alterations on the ECG signal; in consequence, the ECG signals are the most common technique used to diagnose heart diseases. This technique could be complicated for humans; for example, in a complete ECG record, each beat has to be analyzed, sometimes the records last minutes, hours, or even days. After hours of analysis, human error may appear because of tiredness. For that reason, computational methods are an alternative to interpret the ECG signals.
Some years ago, several algorithms for ECG classification had been widely developed. The classical proposes consist of the next stages: Preprocessing, Segmentation, Feature extraction, and Classifier Algorithms. About the preprocessing stage, many techniques have been applied like FIR Digital Filter [5], Adaptive Filters [6], Multiadaptive Bionic Wavelet Transform [7], Nonlinear Bayesian Filters [8], among other things. The Segmentation stage uses techniques like Quad Level Vector [9], Neural Networks [10], Genetic Algorithms [11], Wavelet Transform [12,13], Filter Banks [14] among others. The feature extraction stage applies many algorithms, these are the most common: RR Interval [15,16], proposed Normalized RR Interval, ECG segments or ECG intervals [17], another features extraction algorithms are applied in time or frequency domain [18], Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [19,20], Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) [21], Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [22] among others techniques. The final stage uses techniques like Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [23], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [24], Linear Discriminant [25], Decision Trees [26], Nearest Neighbors [27], Clustering [28], Hidden Markov Models [29], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [1,[30], [31], [32], [33]], inter alia.
Advanced signal processing and learning methods have been applied to develop computational methods to recognize ECG signals. Researchers in the literature have applied one or more of the techniques previously mentioned. In Ref. [34] used a modified U-net model to perform analysis on ECG segments. The authors in Ref. [1] applied CNN to detect the ECG signals. In Ref. [35] preprocessed the ECG signal using a low-complex digital hardware implementation for arrhythmia detection. In Ref. [36] the features of the ECG signal are calculated using Welch's method and a discrete Fourier transform, in the Classifier stage, they use two genetic ensembles based on SVM. An automated system using a combination of CNN and long short-term memory (LSTM) for detection ECG signals is proposed by Ref. [33]. In Ref. [37] extracted the features of the ECG signal using the spectral power density then a machine learning algorithms were used. In Ref. [38] the apply to deep learning(1D-CNN) to detect 17 classes of cardiac arrhythmia. A 9-layer deep CNN to identify 5 different heartbeats in ECG signals is developed by Ref. [30]. In Ref. [31] a CNN structure comprises of four convolutional layers, four max pooling layers and three fully connected layers for the diagnosis of Coronary artery disease was proposed. In Ref. [32] presented a CNN to automatically detect the different ECG segments. The main features of the ECG signals are obtained through discrete wavelet transform, followed by principal component analysis on each decomposed level, the features were reduced through statistical analysis as an input to SVM in Ref. [39]. Arrhythmias detection algorithm that combines a number of ECG parameters using SVM is investigated in Ref. [40]. In Ref. [41] presented an automated method for using a single lead of ECG sensors using PCA, DWT, and SVM. In Ref. [42] the proposal applied PCA of segmented ECG beat, then these features were independently classified using neural network and LS-SVM. In Ref. [43] the authors applied an optimum support vector machine in which the dataset is reduced to 18 features using PCA. A summary of the approaches mentioned is presented in Table 1.Table 1.

The approaches in the literature present the problem that the ECG signals have noise, the authors face the problem applying DWT or other filtering techniques. In this proposal, the signals were preprocessed to eliminate the noise and baseline wander using Wavelet based on Atomic Functions (WAF) due to it eliminates the noise better than the classic wavelets [44], then Z-score was applied to normalize the signals. After these signals were divided into segments, these segments long one second, two seconds, five seconds, and ten seconds. These segments were fed into the classifier stage to make the final decision. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 is a summary of the databases, Section 3 is a description of the proposal, the experimental results are shown in Section 4, Section 5 provides the discussions, and finally, the conclusions.
