Nowadays, the contribution of informal and non-formal learning activities to lifelong learning is widely acknowledged, with the concepts of ubiquitous, everyday, and intuitive learning drawing the attention of both educational institutions and society (e.g. [1], [2]). Despite this increasing interest, informal and non-formal activities are still underresearched, with most of their design decisions relying on the intuition of the expert or the instructional designer.
Informal and non-formal science learning activities for children occur in different places and contexts, such as museums, libraries, computer clubs, Fab Labs (i.e., digital fabrication laboratories), youth centers, conferences, or universities (e.g. [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]). Some studies have reported on entirely voluntary activities taking place in youth centers, museums, libraries, or computer clubs, whereas other studies have explored activities organized as elective, after-school classes, as extra-curricular activities, or even as summer camps (e.g. [6], [8], [10]). From the wide range of places and contexts, much attention has been given to activities taking place in a more traditional environment (i.e., museums, zoos, exhibitions, etc.). However, the links and contributions of the emerging innovative, creative learning and digital fabrication spaces to science education are still underexplored. In these spaces, the activities are constituted from diverse coding and making activities, integrating playfulness and creativity, i.e., combining fun and enjoyment as dominant elements of creating something new. With coding, we refer here to computer programming on different levels, ranging from its simplest form of computer language being taught, e.g., in primary education, to its more complex forms taught in secondary education. Making refers here to the creative production of physical artifacts.
Although most of the informal and non-formal activities are focused on STEM (Science Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), we have seen a wide diversity of design decisions with no clear rationale for how to relate the expected learning outcomes to the way in which the activity is designed [16], [17]. In a study exploring youths’ attitudes toward science from after-school programs, making and scientific argumentation activities were shown to give youth the opportunity to contextualize STEM concepts and broaden their future career options [18]. Two of the most important elements emphasized in the literature [19] are the age and gender of the participants, but there are still no clear guidelines on how these elements can be addressed during the design of the activity. There is also a lack of studies on the dynamics and relationships between the gender of the activity leader experts, the target audience (age and gender), the covered curricular subjects, the main goal, and the place of the activity, nor has there been sufficient research on the best practices and difficulties associated with these activities. This study aims to fill these research gaps. The novelty of our study is also its broad coverage in terms of content and countries involved; our research addresses the topic in an overarching way at a European level. Gaining insight into these dynamics and relationships not only increases our understanding of the ongoing non-formal and informal science learning activities in general, but it also provides a good starting point to design future activities in a more conscious way; for example, to fill existing research gaps, to increase girls’ involvement, or to design activities that better suit the anticipated audience.
To address the topic, we conducted a survey study focusing on coding, making, and playful activities in nine European countries (Austria, Finland, Greece, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the UK). In this paper, we examine responses from 128 highly experienced instructional designers and instructors of informal and non-formal science learning activities (i.e., experts) and discuss how our findings can inform future science learning activities as well as advance research in the area of informal and non-formal science learning activities for children.
