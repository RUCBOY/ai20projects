End-of-life printed circuit boards are one of the fastest-growing e-waste streams which pose potential environmental and health threats. Furthermore, due to the significant quantity of precious metals in circuit boards, finding the most effective and affordable separation method to separate the valuable metals is increasingly important to eradicate e-waste piling up in the landfills. E-waste generation is estimated to be approximately 50 million tons of e-waste per annum (Ruediger K., 2011; Huisman J., 2012). The recycling of e-waste improves supply chain sustainability and support a circular economy. Mainstream metals refining corporations are currently exploiting profits from e-waste and touting for business. High client demand for the newest and most powerful gadgets leads to increasing electronic device production. Therefore, less sophisticated techniques tend to be used for recovering metals (Purchase, D.,2020), which have harmful implications for both labor safety and the environment. These activities, which involve landfills and factories can threaten public health and ecosystems seriously. Furthermore, the implementation of efficient processes and feasible techniques is essential in valuable metals recovery from e-waste, and new and improved techniques for increased efficiency of e-waste recycling are highly sought after.

Generally, the non-metal fraction (NMF) of WPCBs represents approximately 70% of the mass of the WPCB. The NMF consists of fiberglass or cellulose as reinforcing materials (3%), EPDM (0.9%), epoxy, and phenolic or polyester as resins (3%). The most common types of WPCBs are etain (3.9%), polyethylene (2.1%), polypropylene, polyesters, and polycarbonates (6.9%), PVC (6%), and ABS (4.2%) are typical plastic components (Guo et al., 2009). The rest of the constituents are silicon, bismuth, beryllium, calcium, and magnesium oxides (Tiwary et al., 2017). On the other hand, WPCBs are an essential source of base and precious metals providing an economic incentive for their recycling (Lehner T., 1998; Bleiwas D. and Kelly T., 2001; He et al., 2006; Yang et al., 2009; Deveci H. et al., 2010). The average metal content in WPCBs is approximately 30-35% (Vasile C. et al., 2008; Birloaga I. et al., 2013; Oishi T. et al., 2007; Fogarasi S. et al., 2014).
Most of the inorganic materials included in PCBs are reported to the density range of 1.55−19.3 g/cm3. WPCBs contain various valuable metals such as copper, silver, gold, and palladium. Furthermore, the different density characteristics of the elements in PCBs can be taken into consideration for the separation of non-metals and precious metals. As gold especially has the highest density among the other elements, gravity methods can provide the best selective separation for the gold (Gray, T., 2012).
Due to the mutual challenges regarding the e-waste recycling, it is necessary to design the new methods for the recovery of metals. On the one hand, according to the newest designs of Gigabyte and Asus [1, 2] in their future PCBs, a higher amount of precious metals is being used to upgrade desired features of the electronic and electric boards’ demands. On the other hand, to recover the valuable metals, hazardous materials such as lead and flame retardant bearing chemicals require pretreatment before proper disposal (Kumar A. et al., 2018). China, India, and South Africa, which are the traditional destination of the global e-waste, have introduced new strict regulations in terms of importing e-wastes (Guarnieri P., 2020; Goodship V., 2019; Zhang S., 2015). While there are many challenges for e-waste recycling and exporting, the most effective way to solve the problem is to develop an affordable and more environmentally friendly recycling technology to ease the burden of e-waste recycling for industry. However, it is worth mentioning that precious metals extraction from virgin-mines is struggling with the technology and environmental challenges. For instance, the gold concentration in ores to be mined can be as low as 0.4 g/t and it is more complicated to concentrate the content (Lee J. C. and Srivastava R. R., 2016). Furthermore, highly toxic chemicals such as cyanide are required to recover the gold. Therefore, e-waste recycling will bring a reasonable point to be considered as the primary precious metals’ mines.
There are different physical and mechanical recycling techniques for e-waste treatment. The following separation steps use cyclone, fluidization, or jigging as the separation method (He W. et al., 2006; Xue M. et al., 2012; Barnwal A. et al., 2020; Zhu X. N. et al., 2020). These methods include different pretreatment steps such as dry crushing and pulverizing to obtain a mixture of metal and non-metal components. Magnetic separation to extract ferrous particles, eddy current, and high voltage electrostatic separators to separate the metal constituents are also utilized (Xue M. and Xu Z., 2013; Duan C. et al., 2009; Le H. L. et al., 2013; Menad N. et al., 2013; Ilyas S. et al., 2014). Regarding the feasibility of the requirements, technologies can be combined into one unit section with automated lines for e-waste recycling (Zhou L. et al., 2012; Duan C. et al., 2009). However, applying pretreatment before mechanical and physical separations affects the cost of the separation processes. In addition, the previous mechanical and physical studies encounter with some issues, for instance, agglomeration of fine particles during cyclone and fluidization. Regarding the gravity separation methods, as the particle size is reduced (<100 μm), the water flow becomes dominant over the centrifugal force therefore the gravity separation of fine particles could not be effective (Murthy Y. R. et al., 2011; Barnwal A. et al., 2020). In fluidization, the collector requirements such as ionic collectors (oil) to separate hydrophobic and hydrophilic materials will add further organic removal steps for powders, which are used for highly sensitive electrochemical recovery methods.
The significant complex, layered design of WPCBs makes it complicated to achieve an efficient separation by so-called jigging process whereas the leading force is used oscillation by the pulsing of water through the material that allows separate suspension into layers according to different densities (the heaviest concentrate forming the lowest layer and the lightest product the highest one). The negative point of this technique is the impossibility of dividing particles less than one millimeter in size (Schubert G., 1991). In addition to the abovementioned pretreatment methods, thermal treatment and pyrolysis are presented as thermal recycling techniques, which are considered as the supplementary procedure to achieve extra non-metals separation (Fujita T. et al., 2014). According to the most recent studies, high temperatures up to 800 °C have been considered to eradicate the toxic compounds emissions in separation procedures, and purifying the metals’ values (Barnwal A. et al., 2020; Nie C.C. et al., 2020; Hossain et al., 2018; Shokri et al., 2017; Ulman et al., 2018a, 2018b). However, besides high energy consumption, it is acknowledged that the different heating steps can lead to removing Au contents in the solder films. Regarding the equilibrium diagram phase, at the temperature of 250 °C, a two-phase of 63Sn-37Pb matrix and AuSn4 intermetallic compound can be formed (Vianco P.T. et al., 1996, 1993). Therefore, the introduction of a viable method without thermal treatment is of paramount for WPCBs’ recycling.

Motherboards were used as an object of research, whereas printed circuit boards can be collected either from other secondary resources. It can be noticed that even in one form of PCBs, for instance, motherboards, the amount of precious metals varied considerably through the years. In particular, gold values above 1000 ppm were reported in 1993 and 1995. Since then, all values have been reported are below 1000 ppm, with most values below 100 ppm (Bai et al., 2009, Barnwal and Dhawan, 2020). Therefore, considerable differences in the composition of collected PCBs should be considered in recycling techniques. Similar types of PCBs provide more homogeneous material to the mixtures of different e-wastes.
This work aims to define the leading affordable and more straightforward strategies for the separation of valuable metals and the non-metal fraction (NMF) from e-waste based on the dilution-gravity method (DGM) combined with a hydrocyclone. All the WPCBs’ powders are controlled by water flow during the separation process. Hydrocyclone was chosen as a feasible method that was successfully applied for separation of plastic waste (Gent M. et al, 2018, Fu S. et al, 2019). However, to the best of authors’ knowledge separation of WPCBs have not been studied extensively by hydrocyclone. The milling and sieving steps were considered as the first vital steps to concentrate the valuable components. On the one hand, it was expressed previously that fine particles are challenging for the hydrocyclone method as lower efficiencies can be obtained (Vieira, L.G. and Barrozo, M.A., 2014). On the other hand, the finer particle size distribution is vital for enhancing the recovery steps. Consequently, the optimal operating configurations of the hydrocyclone were investigated. The hydrocyclone technique is a simple design, it has high reliability, and uses low maintenance equipment which is required to separate uniform shapes, sizes, and higher density of precious metals. In addition, the dilution-gravity method (DGM) is considered as a simple, efficient method combined with hydrocyclone. The process was evaluated by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP), atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), scanning electron microscope (SEM), and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. The Rosin-Rammler-Bennett (RRB) model was used to evaluate the separation characteristics of the particle size distribution results obtained by particle size analyzer. Therefore, this study design is based on a simple, environmentally friendly method with the advantage of low toxic dust dispersion.
