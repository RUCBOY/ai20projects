Speeches have been a primary methods of communication in politics and public administration, and their pivotal role in the government and Democratic process has been noted since the ancient Greek and Roman government systems (Champion, 2000; Pepe, 2013; Triadafilopoulos, 1999; Fantham, 2003). As these speeches reflect the agenda of the speaker, analysis of the speeches can provide important insights about the way the speaker use language to communicate their views (Dowding et al., 2010; Eshbaugh-Soha, 2010; Schaffner, 1996; Boromisza-Habashi, 2010; Remer, 2008). The information era enables the digitization of archives, making very large databases accessible to large-scale manual and machine analysis of the data. That introduces a new approach to the use of language analysis that can reveal insights about political communication that are difficult to identify manually (Cardie and Wilkerson, 2008; Grimmer and Stewart, 2013; Wilkerson and Casas, 2017).
Converting transcripts of political speeches into numbers can help identify differences and trends in the language used in the speeches that are impractical to detect in large databases by manual inspection of the text (Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). It is clear that such quantitative analysis cannot capture all information, as machine analysis of text has not yet elevated to the analysis power of the human brain. Namely, computer analysis cannot yet fully “understand” the content and context of the speech or define its political meaning. However, machine analysis can reduce the speeches to text elements that can be measured, and therefore allows quantitative analysis and statistical inference of the speeches.
Substantial work has been done in the application of discourse analysis to political communication (Mahdiyan et al., 2013; Adeyanju, 2016; Bonikowski and Gidron, 2015; Reyes, 2015). Natural language processing techniques have also been used to determine ideology proportion in political speeches (Sim et al., 2013), and multi-modal methods that combine text analysis with automatic eye tracking provided additional information to the analysis of the text alone (Scherer et al., 2012). It has also been shown that a political position can be identified automatically from the speech transcript (Laver et al., 2003). Frequency of certain terms and words has also been used to show similarities and differences between politicians, and can be measured directly through their speeches (Savoy, 2010), or indirectly through social media and other content related to the politicians (Chung and Park, 2010). Analysis of political speeches was also applied to identify gender-related language differences in parliamentary speeches (Sensales et al., 2018).
The US Congressional Record is one of the longest spanning and most significant collections of political documents available. Examining this set of speeches has the potential to yield useful information about historical trends in legislative priorities, speech patterns, and other features of debate and political communication in congress. As discussed above, making such discoveries manually is difficult due to the large size of the data.
Previous approaches to analyzing trends in the US Congressional Record using automation have focused on features designed specifically for legislative speeches. Quinn et al. (2006) examined the probability of speeches to be related to a given legislative topic between 1997 and 2005. Their analysis provided clear descriptions of the length of debate on various issues (Quinn et al., 2010). Another method of analysis sought to measure changes in partisanship over time based on the association bigrams with a political party (Gentzkow et al., 2019). The study determined that partisanship remained stable from 1873 until 1994, after which an increase in partisanship of congressional speeches was identified (Gentzkow et al., 2019). Yu (2013) used computational methods to show gender differences between congressional speeches of male and female legislators between the years of 1989 and 2008. Analysis of the frequency of congressional speeches in the 103rd (1993-1994) and 109th (2005-2006) congresses showed that female legislators speak at higher rate than male legislators (Pearson and Dancey, 2011). Yu et al. (2008) used automatic document classification to identify the party of the speech automatically, and identified changes of the speeches across different years, reflected through changes in the classification accuracy of speeches based on the time difference between the training and test data. Diermeier et al. (2012) used a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to identify terms that distinguish between liberal and conservative speeches in the 101st to 108th congresses. Thomas et al. (2006) used automatic text classification to identify automatically whether a speech supports or opposes its relevant bill.
Here we applied quantitative text analysis to examine changes in congressional speeches over 138 years. The approach is based on multiple text measurements computed from each speech, and averaged in each year to obtain statistical signal reflecting the trends of these measurements.
