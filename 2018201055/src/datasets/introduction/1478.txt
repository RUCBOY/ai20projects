Network analysis has attracted considerable attention in a wide range of disciplines, such as physics, sociology, biology, computer science, and many others [1], [17], [35], [38]. The studies on complex networks are diverse, such as network structural properties, and evolutionary dynamics [39], [40]. In this paper, we focus our attention to community detection, which also plays a crucial role in network analysis. It is widely known that many networks have “community structure” [16], [27]: nodes in a network more likely to form different communities, with more links or relationships within communities and only sparse links between them. A variety of networks exhibit obvious community structure, such as social networks [41], metabolic networks [34], food web networks [20].
The reason why community detection is so vital in network analysis is due to the fact that it has many important applications in various areas. For example, after dividing a metabolic network into several small modules, one can find the crucial truth that nodes in different modules function differently with some degree of independence [17]; For some online retailers, such as www.amzon.com, one better way to make its products and services more competitive is to explicitly detect communities of customers with similar interests in the large marketing network, because it can enable retailers to set up more efficient and delicate recommendation systems that can better guide customers.
For the reasons stated above, community detection has become a central task within various areas. The challenge here is how to develop mathematical tools and computer algorithms that can detect and quantify community structure with high efficiency. To address this challenge, in recent two decades, tremendous community detection techniques and measures have been developed, such as cut-based methods [11], [36], random walks [42], edge betweenness [16], [27], modularity [28], [30], motif-based methods [3], [26], and modularity method dealing with the signed networks [22]. For more details about community detection in networks, see reports [15], [24].
However, most of existing community detection techniques face a common problem: the number of communities has to be prefixed. But it is a commonsense that in most of the time, the number of communities in a real network is unknown. Actually, to find or evaluate the number of communities is a highly non-trivial task in network science. Though hard, there are still some techniques which try to address this problem: In [29], [30], Newman put forward an recursive algorithm which is able to keep dividing networks into communities until each community is “indivisible”; Zhao [41] proposed a label switching algorithm that can find the number of communities automatically via a series of hypothesis tests; McAuley [25] developed an unsupervised machine learning method which is capable of finding overlapping community structure in ego networks.
In the field of statistics, blockmodeling methods have been extensively used in analyzing the community structure of various networks [6], [13]. Generally speaking, blockmodeling can be seen as a clustering procedure, where the nodes are clustered together according to their degree of “equivalence”. Holland [18] put forward a stochastic block model on the basis of stochastic equivalence principle, that is two nodes are called stochastic equivalence if their linking probabilities to any other node of the graph are the same. To find the community structure, there are many literatures adapt the method by fitting stochastic block model to networks. In [32], [37], the authors developed an algorithms based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, but their method suffers a highly computational complexity. Bickel et al. [7] proposed an algorithm via profile likelihood approach, they obtained the optimal solution via a greedy search algorithm. Amini et al. [2] put forward an algorithm based on pseudo likelihood method, and a standard EM algorithm was utilized to achieve the optimal value. Again, all the aforementioned statistical methods are built on the same assumption that the number of communities is prior known.
To find the number of communities, Zhao et al. [41] present an extracting method via a series of hypothesis tests, and some crucial consistency properties of their method under the block model were also established. Recently, Bickel et al. [8] put forward a hypothesis test framework via testing whether the largest eigenvalue of an appropriately centred and scaled adjacency matrix converges to the Tracy-Widom law. However, their framework suffered a tiny drawback that though the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix does converge to the Tracy-Widom law, the convergence rate is not fast enough as expected; Their simulations showed even in a graph with 500 nodes, the convergent result of the largest eigenvalue is not that well. To address this drawback, they utilized a sample correction strategy by amending associated means and variances of their test statistic from 50 random samples. However, it is reasonable to believe that it will still suffer a highly computational complexity when the network goes larger.
Our hypothesis test method is similar as that of Bickel’s [8]. The null hypothesis is that there is only one community, in other words, the whole network is generated from an Erdös-Rényi graph [14] G(n, p), where n denotes the number of nodes and p represents the connection probability between pair of nodes. In our work, we use a novel spectral method from random matrix theory. By using a result from Bai et al. [4], we show that the trace of the third-order for a centred and scaled adjacency matrix asymptotically converges to the standard normal distribution. The advantage of our method is that our test statistic converges to the normal distribution very fast even when n is small, so it is no longer necessary to consider correcting parameters like Bickel [8] did. We also prove that this limit result still holds if we replace the connection probability p with an estimation p^.
In this research, we first fit networks by utilizing stochastic block model, then put forward a hypothesis testing framework based on random matrix theory. By combining our algorithm with motif-based community detection method, we find a fast and efficient way to unveil the community structure in various networks. This paper is outlined as follows. In Section 2, we give basic backgrounds on stochastic block model and other related random matrix theory which play a central part in our framework, the corresponding hypothesis testing algorithm and motif based clustering algorithm are also listed in this part. Section 3 presents some simulation results on computer-generated networks, and we test our approach in various real networks with ground truth in Section 4. It turns out that our approach is well suited for detecting community structure in these synthetic and real networks.
