Graph theory is very important area for mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and so on. There is a lot of application in daily life, especially it is used in chemistry. The chemical graph theory is important branch of the graph theory which concerns with mathematical modeling of molecules. It also deals with the study of development of topological indices, isomerism, and found applications in quantum chemistry and stereochemistry [[14], [19]]. Topological indices are mainly used in QSAR as well as QSPR which describe the relation between chemical structure with the properties and reactivity of the compounds [19]. A topological index is a numerical value associated with chemical constitution purporting for the correlation of a chemical structure with various physical properties, chemical reactivity or biological activity [3,20]. Furthermore, topological indices are the molecular descriptors that describes the structures of chemical compounds and it help us to predict certain physico-chemical properties like boiling point, enthalpy of vaporization, stability, and so on [17]. Research on the topological indices has been intensively rising recently. There are numerous topological descriptors that have found some applications in theoretical chemistry, especially in QSPR/QSAR research [4,16,21]. A chemical graph is a graph such that each vertex represents an atom of the molecule, and represents covalent bonds between atoms by edges of the corresponding vertices [2,11].
Let G=(V(G),E(G)) be a simple undirected graph of order n and size m. Now, we give some definitions is related to graphs. For any vertex v∈V(G) , the open neighborhood of v is NG(v)={u∈V(G)|uv∈E(G)} and closed neighborhood of v is NG[v]=NG(v)∪{v}. The degree of vertex v in G denoted by degG(v), that is the size of its open neighborhood [8]. The distance dG(u,v) between two vertices u and vin G is the length of a shortest path between them. The eccentricity value of the vertex u∈V denoted by εG(u), that is the largest between vertex u and any other vertex v of G, εG(u)=maxv∈V(G)dG(u,v). Let f=uv∈E(G). Then, the degree of the edge f, denoted by degG(f), is defined to be degG(f)=degG(u)+degG(v)−2. Let f1=u1v1 and f2=u2v2 be two edges in E(G). The distance between f1 and f2, denoted by dG(f1,f2), is defined to dG(f1,f2)=min{dG(u1,u2),dG(u1,v2),dG(v1,u2),dG(v1,v2)}. The eccentricity value of the edge f∈E, denoted by εG(f), is defined as εG(f)=max{dG(f,e)|e∈E(G)}[9].
The wiener index is he first topological index in chemistry, also is defined by the chemist H. Wiener [13]. The wiener index aims to sum of the half of distances between every pair of vertices of G and it is defined as:(1)W(G)=12∑i=1n∑j=1ndG(vi,vj)
Then, a lot of topological indices were introduced after defining the Wiener index. Some of them are related to degrees of vertices or edges, some of them are related to distance THE between two vertices or edges.
More recently, a new topological index called eccentric connectivity index has been investigated. The eccentric connectivity index ξc(G) was defined by Sharma et al. [26] and has been further studied by some authors [7,18,19,25]. It has been employed successfully for the development of numerous mathematical models for the prediction of biological activities of diverse nature.
The eccentric connectivity index ξc(G) for any graph G is defined as:(2)ξc(G)=∑u∈V(G)εG(u)degG(u)
Then in Ref. [1], the modified eccentric connectivity index ξc(G) was defined as follows:(3)ξc(G)=∑u∈V(G)εG(u)δ(u),where δ(u)=∑v∈NG(u)degG(v), that is the sum of degrees of vertices which is the vertex u neighbor’s, furthermore it was studied in Ref. [29].
After, a new topological index, the edge eccentric connectivity index, has been studied. This index was introduced by Xu et al. [23] and has been further studied by many authors [10,12,15,22,27,28]. The edge eccentric connectivity index of a graph G, denoted by ξec(G), is defined as the following:(4)ξec(G)=∑f∈E(G)εG(f)degG(f),where εG(f) is the eccentricity value and degG(f) is the degree of an edge f in the graph G.
Then, the modified edge eccentric connectivity index ∧ec(G) was defined [5,6] as follows:(5)∧ec(G)=∑f∈E(G)εG(f)S(f),where S(f) denotes the sum of degrees of vertices of neighborhoods of the edge f. It has been further studied by Alishahi and Shalmaee in Ref. [15].
The eccentric connectivity index and the edge eccentric connectivity index are the distance-related topological invariants whose potential of predicting biological activity of the certain classes of chemical compounds made them very attractive for use in QSAR/QSPR studies.
Some chemical structure are represented by special graph types. We can find these types relationships between chemical structure and special graphs. For example, the Dutch windmill graphs that represents bidentate ligands, as can be seen in Fig. 1. This relationships can be seen in Ref. [19].Definition 1.1[19] A graph Dmn obtained by joining n numbers of cycle graphs Cm with a common vertex is known as Dutch windmill graph. The Dutch windmill graph is an undirected and planar graph. We display the graphs D54 and D64 in Fig. 2.Download : Download high-res image (83KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2.

Kanna et al. calculated Atom-bond connectivity index, Fourth atom-bond connectivity index, Sum connectivity index, Randic connectivity index, Geometric-arithmetic connectivity index and Fifth geometric-arithmetic connectivity index of the Dutch windmill graph in Ref. [16]. Then, some degree-based topological indices were computed in Ref. [24]. Very recently, the eccentricity-based topological indices such as eccentric connectivity index, connective eccentric index, first Zagreb eccentricity index, and second Zagreb eccentricity index were calculated for families of Dutch windmill graphs by Idrees et al. in Ref. [19].
Inspired by above articles, other eccentricity-based topological indices such as the edge eccentric and the modified vertex (-edge) eccentric connectivity indices are computed for Dutch windmill graph represents that bidentate ligands in this paper.
