Indole is an aromatic heterocyclic organic compound having the core substructure present in a wide range of natural products such as alkaloids, plants, and animal hormones [1,2]. Because of its unique structural features and biodynamic properties, it has been introduced as a privileged scaffold structure in drug discovery [3], which provides a wide opportunity for the identification of novel drugs for various diseases. Indole containing compounds are well known to exhibit a variety of pharmacological activities such as anti-inflammatory [[4], [5], [6], [7]], antihistamine [8,9], antioxidant [[10], [11], [12], [13]], antidiabetic [14], anticholinesterase [15,16], antiviral [17], antifungal [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22]], antibacterial [[23], [24], [25], [26]], and anticancer [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. Natural indoles isolated from Catharanthus roseus, such as vincristine and vinblastine (act as an anti-mitotic agent), have been widely used worldwide for the treatment of several cancers (e.g., Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, breast, and testicular cancers) [32]. Among all the indole derivatives, bis-indole alkaloids have received increasing attention due to its diverse pharmacological properties and continue to serve as potential drugs for biomedical purposes with different mechanisms of action. It has a unique feature of mimicking the structure of different enzymes where binding occurs in a reversible manner [2,33]. Bis-indole alkaloids such as dragmacidin, topsentin, hyrtiosins, and a marine alkaloid eudistomin K were found to exhibit cytotoxic activity against many cancer cell lines and thus grab the attention for considering as lead compounds for the design of anticancer agents [34,35].
Similarly, drugs having bis-indole moieties were also reported to possess antimicrobial activity [[36], [37], [38], [39]]. Recently, an alkaloid from deep-sea was found to inhibit bacterial growth within MIC = 1–2 μg/mL against six clinical strains of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from humans and pigs [40]. A few other indole compounds such as ethyl-3-Indolylacrylate, 5-Bromo-3-(2-Cyanovinyl) indole, and 3-(2-Nitrovinyl) indole reported are active against microbes [41]. Over the past few decades, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria have posed one of the most important health challenges around the globe. Because of excessive or improper uses of antimicrobials, certain groups of pathogenic bacteria have developed drug resistance to most of the antimicrobials. Amidst endless battle against bacterial infections and drug resistance [42,43], bis-indole derivatives have shown promise against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [40]. Considering the limited availability of antimicrobial agents, rapid increase, and the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, drugs that can inhibit multiple targets of bacteria are of utmost necessity to combat the antimicrobial resistance.
Cancer is an uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells, which can spread and appear in different tissues of the body. It is the second leading cause of mortality after cardiovascular disease [44] and a serious and major problem affecting the health of people all over the world. Unlike normal cells that use specific switches for controlling the cellular growth and proliferation, cancer cells perpetuate these. Thus, the identification of cancer cell targets, active sites, and revealing the target-lead interactions are important for designing new and effective therapeutics for cancers.
In the 21st century, the flare-up of different diseases and discovery of preventive drugs via rational design, synthesis, and subsequent clinical testing pose a real challenge. Therefore, in the past, drug design entailed a single or a few biological entities to curtail the study time and to achieve high specificity and selectivity in order to avoid side effects arising from mistargeting [45]. Fortunately, computer-aided drug designing methods and modern state-of-the-art computational tools have proven to be very useful for rapidly assessing the lead molecules and large chemical databases [46,47]. These expedite to make almost accurate identification of promising candidates possible from the library of lead molecules prior to the beginning of any extensive chemical synthesis, biological testing (in-vivo or in-vitro), and clinical trials, reducing cost and time [[47], [48], [49]]. The role of computational prediction in pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics properties in the successfulness of drug development can't be ignored as well, because these properties (i.e., solubility, hydrophobic effect, bioavailability, absorption, metabolism, and toxicity of the lead compounds) are parameters that used for initially decide how good and safe the drug is [50,51].
Due to the appearance of more complex diseases of seemingly incurable pathology, the single target-based drugs are not sufficient to exert the desired therapeutic effect [52]. Moreover, the current research reveal that drugs hitting more than one target have rather a safer therapeutic profile than the single target-based drug molecules [53]. Multi-target drugs can inhibit in different pathways, thereby enhancing the effectiveness as well as reducing the chances of drug resistance [54]. Based on optimistic research reports and evidence, the multi-target drug has made rapid progress and presently is one of the hottest topics in drug discovery [52,53]. In recent experimental and computational studies, several indole compounds have been reported to inhibit more than one protein target [[55], [56], [57], [58], [59]]. Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2017, 31% of 101 new molecular entities approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were found to have multi-target mechanisms of action [60].
Multi-target drugs are of utmost need to retard the growth and progression of cancers which are facilitated by oncogenic signaling pathways involving several aberrant proteins. In a normal cell, targets usually take part in protein-protein interactions (PPI) in a wide network for different biological activities [61]. In a cancer cell, in turn, variants of these targets take part in oncogenic signaling cascades, which were shown to be non-essential for normal cellular functions [62]. These are recognized as the cancer targets for the discovery of promising drugs. Similarly, many proteins of pathogenic bacteria essential for their survival could be targeted for the inhibition and treatment of microbial infections. Thus, the identification of suitable targets of drugs has immense importance in drug discovery [63]. What draws attention is the presence of bis-indole moiety in many drugs, thus far available, capable of inhibiting various bacterial and cancer targets via wide and diverse pathways; hence this moiety is recognized as the “privileged scaffold” for the discovery of potential drugs [64]. After a thorough literature search, we have selected those cancer and bacterial targets which were reported to be inhibited by indole and bis-indole derivatives previously, such as Akt, DNA topo-isomerase II, histone deacetylases, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells, poly ADP ribose polymerase, proto-oncogene serine/threonine-protein kinase, sirtuins, polo-like kinase1, tankyrase 1, tubulin, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 as cancer targets and dihydrofolate reductase, gyrase B, sortase A, and thymidylate kinase as bacterial targets [[65], [66], [67], [68], [69]]. Using HeLa, PC-3, MDA-MB-231, and BxPC-3 cell lines and MIC, respectively, towards inhibiting cancer and bacterial targets, recently Tantak et al. prepared and tested 14 bis-indole derivatives in which a very few derivatives were reported to be functionally active and promising [27]. Inspired by this and with a significant expansion of this work in terms of the bis-indole derivatives considered, the present study quests for potential drugs with consideration of numerous cancer and bacterial protein targets, which are later validated through Molecular Dynamics (MD).
The objective of the present study is to design and screen bis-indole derivatives as a potential multi-target drug against cancer and bacteria, employing density functional theory (DFT), pharmacokinetics, molecular docking, virtual screening, molecular dynamics (MD), and free energy calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first report of its kind dealing with so many lead compounds and diverse cancer and bacterial targets at a time. We believe that the multi-target drugs screened herein, using well-adapted methodologies, against the selected targets would help in combating concerned diseases and drug resistance, providing substantial information and guidance for further experimental exploration.
