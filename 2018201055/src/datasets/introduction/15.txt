Computer-generated holograms (CGHs) are widely used in various fields such as anti-counterfeiting [1] and aspheric and optical components tests [2], [3]. Currently, there are several methods for processing CGHs such as electron beam lithography [4], standard lithographic techniques [5] and laser lithography combined with reactive ion etching [6]. Although these methods have been used for commercial production, these fabrication techniques based on mask or scanning lithography require sample preparation and numerous processing steps. The processing time is long and the material removal amount for each pixel often requires precise control. Moreover, the structures are often formed on the surface of the material and thus are not resistant to mechanical wear. However, nanostructures [7] or induced refractive index modification [8] which can be used to form holograms can be fabricated inside transparent material by using femtosecond laser. Compared with the amplitude hologram formed by micro explosion [9], [10], the phase hologram is created by writing an array of N × N longitudinal modification. Each longitudinal modification corresponds to a phase retardance which can be adjusted by the length of modification. When there are only two modified lengths, the holography image of fabricated CGH pattern is similar to the result of a binary hologram [11], [12] with twin images. While the fabricated CGH pattern consists of multiple modified lengths, twin images can be effectively eliminated. In this study, we propose a method for rapidly fabricating CGHs by forming a longitudinal modified array through point-by-point processing inside the borosilicate glass using Bessel beams.
