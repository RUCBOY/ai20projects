All the graphs discussed in this paper are supposed to be simple and finite. Let G=(V(G),E(G)) be a graph with vertex set V(G) and the edge set E(G). The number of elements in the sets V(G) and E(G) are called the order and size of the considered graph G, respectively. Usually n represents the order and m represent the size of G. The number of elements in the set NG(v) is called the degree of the vertex v, dG(v), where NG(v) is the set of adjacent vertices with v. In a graph G, δ(G) and △(G) represent the minimum and maximum degree of G. If in a graph δ(G)=▵(G)=k then the graph is called k−regular. A connected graph G is said to be bi-degreed if all the vertices have degree either δ(G) or △(G) and there is at least one vertex with degree △ and δ. A graph G is said to be complete graph if every two vertices are adjacent. A bipartite graph G is a graph whose point set V can be partitioned into two subsets V1 and V2 such that every line of G joins V1 with V2. If |V1|=a and |V2|=b then a complete bipartite graph is denoted by Ka,b. K⌊n2⌋,⌈n2⌉ denotes a complete balanced bipartite graph. A connected graph is said to be semiregular, G(△, δ), if it is bipartite, bi-degreed and each vertex in the same part of bipartition has the seam degree. The path, star, cycle and complete graphs of order n are denoted as Pn, Sn, Cn and Kn.
In [16] and [15] Gutman et. al. proposed the first and second Zagreb indices of a graph G asM1(G)=∑x∈V(G)dG(x)2=∑xy∈E(G)(dG(x)+dG(y))M2(G)=∑xy∈E(G)(dG(x)dG(y))
Recently, Furtula et. al. [13] introduced the forgotten topological index, which was never studied after 1972. The forgotten index is defined asF(G)=∑x∈V(G)dG(x)3=∑xy∈E(G)(dG(x)2+dG(y)2)For history and results on the above discussed topological indices we refer [1], [2], [3], [4], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [14], [17], [18], [19], [20], [24], [32] and the references there in.
Decomposition into special substructures inheriting significant properties is an important method for the investigation of some mathematical structures, especially when the considered structures have self-similarity properties. In this situations we typically only need to study the substructures and the way that they are related with each together, i.e. polymer networks can modeled by generalized Sierpiński graphs [12]. Sierpiński and Sierpiński-type graphs are studied in fractal theory [28] and occur naturally in diverse fields of mathematics and in many scientific fields. In [23], [26] this family of graphs were studied for the first time and constitutes an broadly studied class of graphs of fractal nature with applications in computer science, topology and mathematics of the Tower of Hanoi [27], [29]. Sierpiński, Sierpiński-type and generalized Sierpiński graphs have several unusual properties and were studied largely in literature.
Let G=(V,E) be a graph with order n ≥ 2, t > 0 and Vt be the set of t length words on the alphabet from V. The letters of a word v ∈ Vt are denoted by u1u2⋅⋅⋅ut. The generalized Sierpiński graph of G of dimension t is the graph on vertex set Vt and two words v and w are connected by and edge if and only if there is i ∈ {1, ⋅⋅⋅, t} such that
•vj=wj if j < i•vi ≠ wi and {vi, wi} ∈ E(G)•vj=wi and wj=vi if j > i
The generalized Sierpiński graph of G of dimension t is denoted by ggS(G, t).
In the above definition, one can notice that if vw ∈ E(gS(G, t)), then there is an edge xy ∈ E(G) and a word z such that v=zxyy⋯y and w=zyxx⋯x. A vertex of the form vv⋅⋅⋅v is called the extreme vertex. For a graph G with order n and any integer t ≥ 2, gS(G, t) contains n extreme vertices. Moreover, we have dG(v)=dgS(G,t)(vv⋯v), dG(v)+1=dgS(G,t)wvv⋯v and dG(w)+1=dgS(G,t)vww⋯w.

It is clear that for v ∈ V(gS(G, t)), dS(G.t)(v)∈{dG(v),dG(v)+1}, where dG(v) is degree of v in G. We use the terminology of [12]. Let |dG(v), dG(w)|S{G, t} is the number of copies of {v,w} edge with degrees dG(v) and dG(w) in gS(G, t). For v, w ∈ V(G), the number of traingles of G involving v and w will be denoted by ⊳(v,w) and ⊳(G) represents the number of triangles in G. For any {v, w} ∈ E(G), we have |NG(v)∩NG(w)|=⊳(v,w), |NG(v)∪NG(w)|=dG(v)+dG(w)−⊳(v,w) and |NG(v)−NG(w)|=dG−⊳(v,w). For a graph of order n, we used the function (n)t¯=1+n+n2+⋯+nt−1=nt−1n−1.
Cristea et. al. [5] investigated the distances in Sierpiński graphs and on the Sierpiński gasket. Imran et. al. [22] found some bounds of the degree based topological indices of generalized extended Sierpiński graphs. In [25] Moreno et. al. computed the general Randić index of polymeric networks modelled by generalized Sierpiński graphs. Imran et. al. [21] computed some degree based topological indices of Sierpiński networks. In this paper, we extended the work on topological properties of the generalized Sierpiński graph with any base graph. We attained some bounds on these topological indices in terms of order, size, minimum and maximum degree. To study the topological properties of gS(G, t) we choose the first, second Zagreb and forgotten indices.
