Diffusion of nano-sized particles, dimensions vary from 1 nm to 100 nm into base fluids like water, ethylene glycol, engine oil and transformer oil leads to the formation of nanofluids. Nanofluids possess high thermal and transport properties, due to its uniqueness in enhancing the thermal conductivity, it succeeded in various applications. The necessary dependent factors which help to enhance the thermal conductivity are temperature, volume fraction, size of the nanoparticle, shape of the nanoparticle, base fluid, and method of fabrication of nanoparticles [1]. Many researchers have experimentally studied to the factors which influence the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Das et al. [2], Hojjat et al. [3], Vajjha et al. [4] and Tajik et al. [5] have clearly stated that increase in temperature raises the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Importance of volume fraction in terms of increasing the thermal conductivity of nanofluids studied by Battira et al. [6], Tajik et al. [5] and Aminreza et al. [7] suggested that the temperature and volume fraction are the most vital factors to increase the thermal conductivity of nanofluids. M. Beck et al. [8], Murshed et al. [9], Uddin et al. [10] and Reza et al. [11] tested and revealed that increase in size of nano particle increases the thermal conductivity of nanofluids.
Various researchers investigated the significance of dynamic viscosity for heat transfer coefficient, Masuda et al. [12], Putra et al [13] and Pak and Cho [14] experimentally studied that increase in particle concentration leads to increase the viscosity of nanofluids. Alawi et al. [15] through investigation found that increase in temperature and increase in size of the nano particle decreases the dynamic viscosity of nano fluid. Hemmat Esfe et al. [16] stated that decrease in the nano particle size will increase the viscosity. Alawi et al. [15] and Srivastava [17] discussed about the shape of the nano particle and its importance in the determination of dynamic viscosity of nanofluid. There are so many theoretical correlations and experiments were found and conducted to find the thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of nanofluid but there is very little accordance between them and it is tiresome. Data mining is an important process in knowledge discovery. Data mining techniques are used to extract the hidden pattern knowledge from large dataset. Data mining techniques can be performed using soft computational tool it is an effective one with machine learning algorithms for prediction with ease and accurate.
Machine learning system is the basic to artificial neural networks, fuzzy systems, simulated annealing, rough sets, and genetic algorithms to learn and predict the hidden patterns from the unstructured large data sets. Algorithms like linear regression (LR), multivariate linear and non linear regression (MLR and MNR), back propagation neural network (BP-NN), support vector regression (SVR) and the Gaussian process regression (GPR) methods are available in the machine learning techniques. Many researchers were used Multi layer perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN) with back propagation algorithm for prediction. Tahani et al. [18] proposed an ANN modeling to predict the thermal conductivity of nanofluids and the result is promising with the experimental values. Dalkilic et al [19] performed the prediction of dynamic viscosity by using ANN method. The enhancement in the heat transfer of a nanofluid depends mainly on different values of volume fraction stated by Arman Safdari et al. [20]. The effect of size of the nanoparticle and values of volume fraction in TiO2 nanofluid studied by Hosseini et al. [21] and stated that, increase in volume fraction lead to increase in viscosity of nanofluid. Giovanni et al. [22], Ariana et al. [23] and Khosrojerdi et al. [24] used ANN methodology to predict the thermal conductivity of various nanofluids. Hemmat Esfe et al. [16] and Heidari et al. [25] predicted the viscosity of various nanofluids using ANN techniques.
Very few researchers used Support Vector Machine and Regression methods for prediction of thermal conductivity and viscosity of nanofluids. Zanty et al. [26] used support vector machine for classification, Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an non linear generalization algorithm using VC theory stated by Vapnik [27], Ibrahim et al. [28] predicted the thermal conductivity of nanofluid by using ANN and SVR method and concluded that SVR method has more accuracy than ANN method for prediction of thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Khairul et al. [29] studied experimentally the prediction of heat transfer coefficient and friction factor of CuO/H2O nanofluid using fuzzy logic expert system. The temperature and volume fraction data were used to predict the thermal conductivity of nanofluids in most of the research works. From the literature review, it seems that a very little research work was done by using Gaussian process to predict the thermal conductivity and dynamic viscosity of nanofluids. Hence in this investigation, Gaussian Process Regression model (GPR) has been used to predict the thermal conductivity ratio and dynamic viscosity ratio of Al2O3/H2O nanofluids. As an input data, predictor variables such as temperature, volume fraction and size of the nanoparticles are used. It is observed in this paper, the behavior of different kernel functions and the accuracy in prediction. In addition the effectiveness and interaction between the predictor variables were also studied. The proposed model is optimized with hyper parameters and compares the predicted data with the experimental data. There is a good accordance between the experimental values and predicted values by the GPR model.
