Proteins can be considered as individuals and analyzed based on their chemical structures [1], [2] such as accessible surface area, planarity, length and breadth and many other factors [3], [4]. These characteristics can be used for varied purposes like predicting interactions among proteins [5], [6] and adverse drug reactions [7], [8], [9]. In addition to individual analysis, analyzing protein interactions has recently attracted a lot of attention [10], [11], [12]. Protein–Protein Interaction (PPI) networks can be used for predicting protein functions [13], [14], [15], novel protein interactions [16], drug targets [17], [18], drug side effects [19] and cancer-related proteins [20], [21], [22].
Graphs are the most common representation of PPI networks. In graph representations, each node represents a protein and each edge indicates an interaction between two proteins. One of the research fields in graph theory is discovering important nodes in the graph [23], [24].
PPI networks can be annotated with additional information like protein functions and proteins targeted by diseases or drugs. Proteins discovered as important can be evaluated with respect to these additional properties available for each protein. For example, proteins involved in certain diseases [25], [26], those with complimentary functionality [27] or those targeted by multiple drugs [28], [29] can be labeled as important.
Discovering important nodes in graph data has been studied extensively in varied domains including social media [31], [32], urban management [33] and economy [34]. In the field of social media, node importance is mostly defined by node influence on network. Degree Centrality, Betweenness Centrality and Closeness Centrality are common methods used in complex networks to discover influential nodes [35], [36]. Shetty et al. [37] discovered high designation employees as important nodes by applying entropy measure on Enron email data set [38]. Bashiri et al. [39] improved Shetty’s method by using normal entropy in the same data set. Wang et al. [40] showed that considering the degree of nodes’ neighbors in addition to their own degrees can improve the result.Table 1. 3 sample proteins with their corresponding annotations.

Similar to social networks, certain proteins are more important in PPI networks as they are involved in the control of essential processes. The measure which quantifies the importance of a gene and the translated protein is essentiality. A gene is essential if its deletion leads to the organism’s death. It is conditionally essential if its knockout leads to the organism’s death in certain conditions [41], [42]. Network biological measurements were used for predicting essentiality. In scale free networks the degree of a protein predicts its essentiality [43]. Also, proteins with high betweenness centrality in a signaling network tend to be essential [44]. These metrics were applied in predicting novel antibiotics targets in Pseudomonas aeruginosa [45] and helped identify novel cancer therapeutic targets [46]. Clearly, proteins with more interactions have a higher probability of participating in at least one of these interactions [47]. Vallabhajosyula et al. [48] used topological characteristics in addition to gene expressions and gene functions to identify hubs as important nodes in PPI networks.
Kumar [22] et al. applied different centrality measures to discover important proteins. They evaluated their result according to the involvement of discovered proteins in oral cancer. Guney et al. [49] proposed a modified shortest path method called GUILD to highlight disease-genes. Halakou et al. [50] used GUILD to discover proteins that play important roles in brain and lung metastasis of breast cancer.
In this paper, we address the problem of discovering important nodes in PPI networks. We propose a new method called EMDIP that uses entropy measures on PPI networks augmented by annotation data in order to discover important proteins.
The main contributions of EMDIP are as follows:

•In addition to annotation of each individual node, EMDIP considers the relational position (with respect to neighboring nodes) of each node in a given network. EMDIP introduces the novel concept of annotation-context to describe nodes based on their neighbors’ annotation.•EMDIP uses Shannon entropy to measure the variety of annotation-context around one given node.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our proposed method in formal form. Section 3 discusses three DrugBank, Side effect and miRNA data sets used in this paper. Section 4 evaluates our method. Section 5 concludes.
