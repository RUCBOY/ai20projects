After Satoshi Nakamoto proposed and built Bitcoin in 2008, the blockchain, as the underlying technology of Bitcoin, received extensive attention from the academic community and the society (Nakamoto, 2008). Gradually, people became familiar with the characteristics of blockchain technology, such as decentralization, security, and openness (Morkunas et al., 2019; Mohanta et al., 2019). At present, there is no consistent conclusion on the nature of blockchain in academia, but there is a well-accepted term. In essence, blockchain is a new application model which embraces decentralized terminal transmission and cryptography, mass data storage, and other computer technologies, derived from Bitcoin distributed technology (Decker and Wattenhofe, 2013).
In terms of blockchain architecture, the three-layer architecture is one of the most representative model (Nodejs develops cryptocurrency, 2019), as shown in Fig. 1. Any blockchain architecture model can be roughly divided into five steps: 1) new transaction initiation, 2) P2P network dissemination, 3) node verification, 4) passing verification and broadcasting to the entire network, and 5) transaction writing.Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Blockchain architecture.
Several important characteristics of blockchain have been preliminarily explored in some specific fields as the research is progressing. Currently, blockchain technology has been applied in not only the financial industry which is the birthplace of the Bitcoin, but also the public affairs management, the electric power, the transportation, and the logistics (Yli-Huumo et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2019a; Mohanta et al., 2019).
