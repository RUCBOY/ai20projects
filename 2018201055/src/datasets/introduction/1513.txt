In the study of nonlinear ODEs, there is a huge gap between what we can observe in numerical simulations and what we can prove rigorously. It is possible to overcome this problem by means of computer-assisted poofs. For its realization it is desirable to have a library for rigorous integration of ODEs and computation of Poincaré maps derived from ODEs. There are several libraries designed for rigorous integration of ODEs. Some of them are open source, just to mention [1], [3], [4], [2], and some are not [5]. To the best of our knowledge none of them directly supports computation of Poincaré maps, which is a powerful tool for studying dynamics of ODEs.
In the present paper we describe the CAPD::DynSys library [6] which is well suited for this task. What this library offers may be described as follows.
Consider an initial value problem for an ODE(1)x′=f(λ,t,x),(2)x(t0)=x0,where x∈Rn, t is a time variable, λ∈Λ⊂Rk is a fixed parameter and f:Λ×R×Rn→Rn is a smooth, ’programmable’ function. Let φ(t,t0,λ,x0) be a solution of (1)–(2) for some fixed λ. Given a set of initial conditions Z⊂Rn, parameters Δ⊂Λ and a t>t0 we want to:
•establish that for all x0∈Z and λ∈Δ the solution φ(t,t0,λ,x0) is defined,•give a rigorous bound for Daφ(t,t0,λ,x0) valid for all x0∈Z and λ∈Δ, where Da is the partial derivative operator with respect x0 and/or λ of order r. The case r=0 means that we compute rigorous bounds for φ(t,t0,Δ,Z).
Analogous questions can be asked for Poincaré maps for ODEs.
The CAPD::DynSys library can accomplish these tasks for many interesting systems for n not too large (an example of a ‘large’ value of n up to which the library performed well is n=80, which was used for choreographies in N-body problem [7], [8]) and the order of the partial derivatives is also not too large, say r=2,3 (the library handled r=5 in validation of KAM tori [9]) if the sizes of initial conditions are not too big and the integration time t−t0 is not very large.
The fact that we can compute (enclose) φ(t,t0,Δ,Z) in single computation is essential for the computer assisted proofs, as very often abstract theorems in dynamics involve assumptions on the behaviour of solutions on sets, while the single trajectory computations usually do not lead to interesting rigorous statements about the dynamics of the underlining ODE.
In the following discussion we will say that we performed Cr computations if the partial derivatives up to order r have been computed.
1.1. Short historyCAPD is an acronym for “Computer Assisted Proofs in Dynamics”. The library was initiated in early 1990’s by Marian Mrozek as the tool for the computer assisted proof of chaotic dynamics in the Lorenz system [10], [11], [12]. The present version of the library is split into CAPD::DynSys and CAPD::RedHom [13] parts, devoted to the dynamical systems and topology, respectively. The present article focuses on tools from CAPD::DynSys. The DynSys part was developed by Mrozek’s Ph. D. students and their descendants at the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland. The most important contributors are (listed more or less chronologically): P. Zgliczyński, P. Pilarczyk, D. Wilczak, T. Kapela.Papers of Mischaikow, Mrozek and Szymczak on the Lorenz attractor [10], [11], [12] used C0 computations, only. Other results using C0 computations in CAPD library from these early stages of development are•symbolic dynamics for the Rössler system [14],•connecting orbits in the Michelson system [15],•periodic orbits in the Rössler system [16].The early version of C0-integrator was based on the logarithmic norms and it was slow and inefficient, when compared to the algorithms currently used by the library.Around 2000 the Lohner algorithm [17] (for C0-computations) and C1-Lohner type algorithm [18] for efficient C1-computations were implemented in the CAPD library. The implementation was designed for very limited types of vector fields, namely degree two polynomials, which include well known Rössler [19], [20], Lorenz [21] and Michelson [22] systems. Around that time Daniel Wilczak joined the project and implemented these algorithms for general ’programmable’ vector fields using the automatic differentiation [23]. The CAPD library was published online for the first time in 2004. Around the year 2008 the Cr-Lohner algorithm [24] was added to the library, and soon after this a rigorous solver of differential inclusions [25] and support for computation in high precision were written by Tomasz Kapela.
1.2. Some computer assisted proofs using CAPD libraryThe quality of the bounds provided by the CAPD::DynSys library can be judged by looking at the list of computer-assisted proofs in dynamics of ODEs in which it was used. The list below is incomplete, we focus only on a number of selected applications. The results using C0- and C1-computations include the questions of the existence of periodic orbits and their local uniqueness, the existence of symbolic dynamics, the existence of hyperbolic invariants sets, the existence of homo- and heteroclinic orbits. Here are some examples•symbolic dynamics in the Hénon-Heiles Hamiltonian [26],•symbolic dynamics and symmetric periodic orbits in Michelson system [27],•homoclinic and heteroclinic connections between Lyapunov orbits and symbolic dynamics in the planar circular restricted three body problem [29], [28],•Shilnikov orbits and Bykov cycles in the Michelson system [30],•existence of choreographies in Newtonian N-body problem [7], [8],•hyperbolic Smale-Williams attractor for Kuznetsov System [31],•invariant manifolds in the restricted three body problem by Capiński and his coworkers [32], [33],•Birkhoff regions of instability in the three body problem, using Aubry-Mather theory, by Galante and Kaloshin [34],•existence of double spiral attractor in the Chua’s circuits by Galias and Tucker [35],•counting of periodic orbits of flows by Galias and Tucker [36], [37],•stability of N-body motions forming platonic polyhedra by Fenucci and Gronchi [38],•study of periodic by orbits by Miyaji and Okamoto [39],•existence of unimodal solutions in the Proudman–Johnson equation by Miyaji and Okamoto [40],•study of singularities in dynamical systems by Matsue [41],•applications to rigorous estimates of reachable sets in the context of control theory and robotic by Jaulin and his coauthors [42], [43] and Cyranka et al. [44],•heteroclinic connections in Ohta–Kawasaki Model by Cyranka and Wanner [45],•attracting invariant tori by Capiński, Fleurantin and James [46].To address other phenomena, such as bifurcations of periodic orbits, invariant tori through the KAM theory, nonlinear stability of elliptic periodic orbits, KAM stability etc. one needs the knowledge of partial derivatives with respect to the initial conditions of the higher order. Using algorithms from CAPD::DynSys library for Cr-computations the following results has been obtained•global and local bifurcations of periodic orbits and invariant manifolds [47], [48], [49], [50],•Arnold diffusion in the restricted three body problem by Capiński and Gidea [51],•non-linear stability of elliptic periodic solutions [9], [52], [53],•normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds and computer assisted Melnikov method [54], [55], [56].
1.3. Outline of the paperIn Section 2 we describe the basic interface to CAPD::DynSys library. In 3 , 4  and 5 we present a list of case studies on how the CAPD::DynSys library can be used in various contexts. Examples are grouped by the maximal order of space derivatives involved – we refer to them as C0, C1 and Cr computations. The examples selected here are on the one hand very short (so that it is possible to write out the full C++ code) but on the other side are non-trivial and present diverse spectrum of mathematical problems, where the CAPD::DynSys library may be helpful.
