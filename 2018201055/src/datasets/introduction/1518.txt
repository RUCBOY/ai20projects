In the modeling of economic systems using methods of statistical physics, the kinetic market models are known to simulate real econometric data of money, income and wealth distributions [1], [2], [3]. The dynamics of these models is unique and complex, which motivated an earlier attempt to use it as a heuristic to solve optimization problems [4]. Despite the insightful reinterpretation of the exchange procedure in that work, the resulting algorithm does not solve high-dimensional optimization problems. This research corrects previous findings by showing that the mechanisms acting on the kinetic market model are the same as those applied in the area of random search. It aligns with other initiatives to use physical phenomena or its metaphors to propose meta-heuristics. However, on the contrary to initiatives in physics [5] or computer science [6], where particles are introduced to solve optimization tasks and the concepts of velocity or direction are needed, this work shows that just the energy exchange proposed by the kinetic market is enough to design a random search optimization algorithm.
Irrespective of the many existing variants of random search, each one can be described as composed of two basic operators: sampling and selection of states [7]. It means that, at any moment in the simulation, the system will use the actual state for sampling new ones. Among these samples, the application of some criteria selects the new current state. The objective of a random search is to move the simulation from a randomized starting point towards a specific individual or a population. Econophysicists do not imagine their kinetic models as a random search because their inspiration comes from a stylized interpretation of gas modeling [8]. In their version, the particles become a society of agents where random pairs of individuals perform a monetary transaction instead of an atomic collision. The idea of emergence governs these models, based on the assumption that local interactions satisfactorily explain the macrobehavior of the system. Consequently, the model is fully described only by its exchange rules, as given by the following equations (1a)mi(t+1)=ϵ∗mi(t) where ϵ=U(0,1)(1b)mj(t+1)=mj(t)+mi(t)−mi(t+1)
 introduced in [9] and analyzed in [3], where m is the money or energy of the agent i and j at time t or t+1, and U is a uniform distribution. From a computer science perspective, the recurrences in Eq. (1) resemble an algorithm for a population-based random search, as described in [6]. Rewriting Eq. (1) as (2a)S={s1,s2,s3,…,sk},k samples from U(0,mi(t))(2b)mi(t+1)=X,x∈S,P(X=x)=1|S|(2c)mj(t+1)=mj(t)+mi(t)−mi(t+1)
 aids in this argumentation. Eqs. (2a) and (2b) are equivalent to Eq. (1a). More specifically, Eq. (2a) is sampling new states. It defines the set S with k number of samples with lower energy than mi(t). Eq. (2b) imposes a selection mechanism because it defines a procedure to accept and discard elements through the probability function P. It selects the state mi(t+1) at random among all the options in the set S. Eq. (2c) selects the state mj(t+1) using the energy conservation principle.
Although models given by Eqs. (1) and (2) produce the same distribution, the new formulation has the merit to assess the nature of the sampling set S and the implications of following the energy conservation principle. The econophysicists perceive their models only in the continuous domain [10], [11], [12], which limits other possibilities for the set S. In evolutionary computing, a random search inspired by the theory of evolution [13], a variate of objects can compose the set S. The individuals become complex entities, like robots [14], virtual agents [15], engineering designs [16], artificial neural networks [17] or even a vector for black-box optimization [18].
The possibility of considering other objects than continuous quantities and the uncertainty resulting from by the sampling process make it improbable to sustain a strict energy conservation principle. At any moment, the system cannot guarantee a sample or an individual with the required value to maintain the equality imposed by the conservation equation. In typical problems of random search, finding mj(t+1) with an energy level equal to conservation is improbable, inexistent or requires the exploration of all the state space, which is in general a computationally infeasible task. In these cases, mj(t+1) depends on sampling and is adequately described using its non-conservative form given by a relation of the kind mj(t+1)≈mj(t)+mi(t)−mi(t+1). The equations (3a)W={w1,w2,w3,…,wk},k samples from U(mj(t),mj(t)+mi(t))(3b)q=mj(t)+mi(t)−mi(t+1)(3c)a=max{w∈W|w<=q}(3d)b=min{w∈W|w>=q}(3e)mj(t+1)=Y,P(Y=a)=p,P(Y=b)=1−p
 define the approximation to energy conservation in this work. To explain it, supposing that the sampling process in Eq. (3a) generates the ordered list W=(mj(t),…,a,b). Given a<q<b with q, a and b in Eqs. (3b), (3c) and (3d) respectively, then approximation becomes a choice between the elements a or b. However, if each transaction always selects the sample a for mj(t+1), the system will lose its total energy continuously. The opposite occurs if b is selected. Selecting a or b probabilistically, as in Eq. (3e), the gain provided by b could alternate with some loss imposed by a. Moreover, if the states a or b do not exist when selected, the transaction is canceled.
Using this approach to approximate energy conservation, the proposed non-conservative kinetic market model abstracts the original one. In this new form, it supports a society of individuals from evolutionary computing. In the context of computer science optimization tasks, the proposed market is a family competition evolutionary algorithm with a new selection rule. As shown in the paper, this rule has better performance than classical ones, given initial experiments with challenging combinatorial optimization problems. For econophysicists, the scaling behavior of the new model is useful to describe an open society where the total resources available can decrease and increase over time. The probability function P in Eq. (3e) can set the society’s total energy in a random walk or oscillatory behavior, adding new dynamics to the kinetic model while keeping its simplicity. Therefore, this research is also an application and an extension of the concepts first proposed in [19], [20].
To summarize, the goal of the present work is to highlight an identity between non-conservative kinetic market models of distribution and evolutionary algorithms used in computer science. For that purpose, non conservation is revisited and interpreted as a selection process in Section 2. In Section 3, it is shown how typical operations of an evolutionary algorithm can be used for an original computational implementation of a market model. Conclusions and possible perspectives are drawn in Section 4.
