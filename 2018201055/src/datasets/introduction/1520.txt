SpaceIL’s lunar lander mission named Beresheet (meaning ‘in the beginning’ or ‘Genesis’ in Hebrew) is the first Israeli mission beyond Earth orbit. SpaceIL is the organization established in 2011 originally to compete this mission in the Google Lunar XPRIZE (GLXP) competition, itself aimed at stimulating lunar exploration. The GLXP challenged non-governmental teams to land an unmanned robotic spacecraft on the Moon, travel 500 ​m, and transmit high-definition video and images back to Earth.
SpaceIL progressed to the final stages of the competition, which officially ended in March 2018 without a winner. However, SpaceIL had decided to complete the mission independent of the competition and an early 2019 launch date was set. The project was supported by the Israel Space Agency (ISA), the Israel Ministry of Science and Technology (IMOST), and the Israel erospace Industries (IAI), among others (Gibney, 2019).
The spacecraft was launched on February 22, 2019 onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida. The mission consisted of three phases: multiple Earth orbits followed by lunar orbit insertion, a soft-landing maneuver, and stationary operation on the Moon’s surface. Besides being the first Israeli spacecraft to leave Earth orbit, the mission included several science investigation goals which will be described below.
The main stages of mission timeline are outlined in Table 1 and shown in Fig. 1. Shyldkrot et al. (2019) outlines the trajectory, the maneuver strategy, and the navigation plan.Table 1.

Discontinuities in Beresheet’s position are due to updates to the calculation of the orbital trajectory.
