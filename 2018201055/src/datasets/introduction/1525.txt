The undesirable impacts of steel corrosion are one of the most objects in different industrial applications, which can leave high material/cost waste in long terms. Recently, various methods have been employed for controlling the MS aggression in harsh acidic/neutral environments [1,2]. The utilization of inhibitors is one of the most common ways for the corrosion retardation of the metals [3]. Generally, the inhibitors can retard the aggression by donating the lone pairs of electrons of heteroatoms to vacant d-orbitals of Fe [4]. Recent studies demonstrated that organic corrosion inhibitors behave desirably in acidic solutions [5]. Recently, the utilization of high-performance corrosion inhibitors in saline environments, i.e., wastewater industries, heat exchangers, boilers, and different oil/gas equipment, become a hot topic for researches [6].
Zhu et al. explored the glutamic acid corrosion inhibition effect in 3.5 wt% NaCl solution via electrochemical and surface examinations. The EIS outcomes demonstrated that by dissolving 1000 ppm of glutamic acid, an inhibition efficiency of about 27% was reached. The FE-SEM images proved the presence of porosities in the constructed layer [7]. Usman et al. investigated the inhibition degree of tannic acid in 3.5 wt% NaCl environment. The reported EIS/Tafel outcomes demonstrated 51% inhibition efficiency after dissolving 500 ppm tannic acid in corrosive solution [8].
According to recent studies, organic inhibitors can cover the anodic sites in neutral environments. To protect the cathodic sites of steel, the inorganic inhibitors are needed. Nowadays, novel organic/inorganic inhibitors were introduced as high performance inhibitors in neutral solutions [9]. Through chelation of the organic inhibitors with inorganic ions (i.e., Zn2+, Ce3+, and Sm3+), both cathodic/anodic zones can be protected from the corrosive attacks in saline media. Based on Zhu et al. reports, 300 ppm of pure Ce ions can mitigate 50% of the corrosion activity. However, after combining 300 ppm of Ce ions with 500 ppm of glutamic acid, the inhibition performance of about 85% was obtained. According to Dehghani et al. studies, in the presence of 800 ppm of Sm (III), an inhibition efficiency of about 92% was reached. By mixing 600:200 ppm ATMP:Sm compounds, the corrosion reactions were retarded by 98% during 120 h of the steel immersion [10].
Due to the high toxicity of the chromatic/nitric inhibitors, green inhibitors, i.e., biopolymers [11], ionic liquids [12], plant extracts [13], and bio-based inhibitors (e.g., Quercetin), were employed as desirable organic inhibitors [14]. On the other side, the hazardous effects of the zinc-based inorganic inhibitors were demonstrated in recent literature. For this reason, the biocompatible inorganic rare earth elements (i.e., Sm3+ and Ce3+) were utilized for protection of the cathodic sites against aggressive species attacks [15].
Generally, Quercetin can be found in the plant extract. Recently, the presence of Quercetin was proved in the green tea, raw onions, berries, and ginkgo extracts [16]. Also, the medical application of this molecule was investigated in different scientific works [17]. Based on the recent studies, the presence of heteroatoms can help the electron donation activity of the organic molecules with the empty orbitals (anticorrosion effect) [18]. The structure of Quercetin molecule is full of oxygen, which makes it capable of chemical bonding with metal cations.
