In “Metric Culture: Ontologies of Self-Tracking Practices,” Ajana (2018) argues that we are living in an era where data, algorithms, and metrics play an important role in all aspects of society. The increasing interest in demonstrating the impact of research outputs in higher education is part of this metric culture that is being driven by various internal and external forces. Accountability, assessment, and competition are some of the main driving forces resulting in a proliferation of metrics to measure research impact in what Wilsdon et al. (2015) called the Metric Tide. This trend (or tide) is unlikely to ebb. In fact, the rise of altmetrics to complement and explore additional aspects of scholarly impact is illustrative of this growing trend. One of the newer altmetrics that is gaining attention are citations of scholarly works in syllabi. The idea of using citations in syllabi as an impact metric was posited by Cronin et al. (1998) over two decades ago, though only recently have syllabi been systematically collected and easily searchable. Citations in syllabi provide another means for researchers to demonstrate the impact of their research on future researchers in a given discipline. As with any metric, there are limitations and the principles of responsible metric use should always be considered. For better or worse, we are living in a metric culture and it is best to understand these metrics (and their limitations and abuses), so that we can use them to responsibly assist others in telling their own personal or institutional scholarly narrative.
