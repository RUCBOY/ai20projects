Many clinical decision support systems (CDSS) exist to improve patient care. Improvements might include efficiency [1], cost effectiveness [2], or guideline-concordance [3,4] - the latter often yielding reduced inappropriate test orders [5] or patient outcomes, whether through reduced morbidity [6], mortality [7], or adverse events [8]. Many CDSS are developed and implemented by clinician champions with first-hand understanding of challenges in specific clinical domains. Some CDSS become successful and enjoy worldwide uptake.
Literature shows that successful CDSS implementations share specific features or considerations [9,10], and that careful design is necessary, as outlined in Bates’ Ten Commandments for Effective Clinical Decision Support [11]. However, a clinician might enthusiastically publish their concepts without considering important design aspects or clear direction on details for effective CDSS design. Human-centred design (HCD) research/design methods and principles exist to ensure that a tool/product is easy to use, integrates into workflows, and is designed for target users at each development stage. HCD draws from well-established design principles in many disciplines (including usability [12], graphics [13], interface design [14], human factors & psychology [15]), and target users’ context/experience. HCD thus creates a foundational methods ecosystem to ensure well-designed systems and experiences. Without application of HCD principles, the effectiveness of CDSS may be severely limited, not meet guidelines, or even cause more harm than good [16].
This article describes common HCD methods and case study focusing on a CDSS tool supporting pulmonary embolism diagnosis – an inherently challenging clinical area. We further provide HCD prescriptions that address Bates’ Commandments. This article is relevant to any CDSS creation intending to be intuitive, evidence-based, and foundational for any clinical pathway.
