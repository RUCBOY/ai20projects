High grades in mathematics courses and good results in mathematics exams are typically required for entering mathematics-related majors in tertiary education. Thus mathematics is considered to be a crucial filter on access to many high-status, well-paid occupations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics—or STEM (Watt et al., 2017). At the same time, there is a persistent and well-documented underrepresentation of women in STEM. While enrollment in STEM majors depends mostly on the results of standardized mathematical exams, levels of ability alone cannot explain the gender gap arising in the said “filtering.” The cause is still unclear and has given rise to different research streams.
In the current article, we analyze the crucial, gendered choices of subjects in the high-stakes Polish matura exams that serve as a de facto filter for STEM majors in tertiary education. Our aim is to establish the net effects of ability level and ability profile on those decisions by assuming that (a) part of those relations is probably mediated by the school environment, and (b) the causal relation between choice and ability (both level and tilt) is partly reciprocal. We account for the two issues to show that the actual impact of ability tilt is much more substantial than its gross effect.
