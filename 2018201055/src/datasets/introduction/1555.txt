The existence of electrification in the atmosphere in fair weather has been recognised since the time of Franklin (e.g. Ref. [1,2]). Fair weather atmospheric electric fields are readily observed to be strongly influenced by local meteorological phenomena ([3]), such as charged layer clouds ([4]). Investigating such weakly-charged clouds electrically and meteorologically requires compact electric field instrumentation, able to be carried aloft by a variety of modern airborne platforms. Further reasons motivating small electric field sensor development include determining the ionospheric potential variations from regular vertical electric field profiles in clear air (e.g. Ref. [5,6]), and exploring the effect of charge on long range dust transport in atmospheric electric fields ([7,8]).
Early technologies to measure fair weather electric fields employed potential equalisers and electrometers, exemplified by the range of devices designed by Lord Kelvin in 1859 ([9]). Induction methods, such as the alternately exposed and screened sensing plate of C.T.R Wilson ([10]), were also developed. An induction device employing a motor-driven earthed shutter was later implemented by Harnwell and Van Voorhis [11]. This was designed to measure large laboratory electric potentials, but its use of an earthed shutter to expose and shield a sensing electrode was essentially the first electric field meter operating on the field mill principle. A field mill device was first used to measure fair weather electric fields by Lueder [12], developed further to provide continuous atmospheric measurements by Mapleson and Whitlock [13]. Through implementing a screened reference electrode on the rotating shaft carrying the shutter, the drag and wear associated with earthing by brush contacts can be avoided ([14,15]), making fast response devices with long operating life possible.
Several robust designs of electric field meters are now commercially available, installed at many international sites to monitor the atmospheric electric field in different weather situations ([16]). Field meters have also been constructed for airborne measurements of the fair weather electric field profile ([[17], [18], [19], [20]]), operating on the double field mill principle ([21]) to compensate for the platform's charge. These approaches were not developed further for a modern lightweight meteorological balloon system, which, with increased bandwidth, now permits additional sensors to be carried ([22]). They also entirely pre-date the availability of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) technology.
Exploiting new airborne platform opportunities using small payloads on remotely piloted aircraft or routine weather balloons launches is, of course, precluded if the instrumentsâ€™ cost, dimension, mass or power consumption exceed that which can be carried. Here, a compact field meter operating on the field mill principle is discussed, intended for use on balloon and robotic aircraft platforms.
