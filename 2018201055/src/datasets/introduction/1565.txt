Currently, there is an increasing demand for the materials possessing special properties. Organo-inorganic compounds can provide such properties to the materials [[1], [2], [3]]. For instance, sensors based on a siloxane polymer were designed for the detection of vapors of various amines [4]. Compounds, which are rich in boron and nitrogen content, have the potential to find application as high-energy materials [5]. To obtain polymers possessing special properties, phosphazenes and especially aryloxyphosphazenes are of considerable interest due to their high chemical and thermal stabilities, and incombustibility [6]. Moreover, there is an opportunity to vary functional groups at the aromatic rings and consequently, to obtain the derivatives with a set of the desired properties. This allows aryloxyphosphazenes to be employed in various fields of science and technology [7,8]. Due to the synergy of phosphorus and nitrogen, phosphazenes are capable of providing incombustibility to various polymers [9]. Polyphosphazenes are non-toxic, so they are already applied in medicine [10]. Functional cyclophosphazenes can act as polydentate and chelating ligands. Complexes based on them are used in electronics and optics [11].
Formylphenoxytriphosphazenes are most often utilized as intermediates in the preparation of functionalized aryloxyphosphazenes due to the possibility of chemical transformations of the aldehyde group into others. For example, aryloxyphosphazenes bearing isonitroso groups were obtained in this way [[12], [13], [14]], and their reactions with benzyl and benzoyl chloride [12], alkyl bromides [13], and propanoyl and acryloyl chlorides [14] were investigated. It is possible to synthesize compounds from formylcyclophosphazenes, which are applied in the polymer chemistry: catalysts [15], polymerization initiators [16], and derivatives containing double bonds capable of the copolymerization [17].
Phosphazene derivatives are also widely used in various fields of medicine due to their biological inertness. Polyphosphazene bearing 4-formylphenoxy groups at the side chain can be employed as a polymer carrier in drug delivery systems [18]. A reaction of hexakis [4-formylphenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene with hydrazides of benzoic acid yielded the hydrazone, which can be used as a system for the pH-dependent drug release due to the presence of azomethine group [19]. Hydrazone derivatives of phosphazene have also demonstrated antitumor activity, in particular, towards cancer cells of the liver and cervix [20]. Chemotherapeutic agents with bioactive molecules were obtained on the basis of Schiff bases prepared from hexakis [p-formylphenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene [21]. Formylphenoxyphosphazenes allows one to synthesize compounds exhibiting antifungal [22], antimicrobial [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26]], anticarcinogenic [[24], [25], [26]], and immunostimulating [27] activities, as well as biodegradable materials [28,29] and efficient glucose biosensors [30].
Formylphenoxyphosphazenes are also of interest in the electronics. A derivative bearing oxyethylene moieties, prepared from octakis [4-formylphenoxy]cyclotetraphosphazene, has been reported [31]. The introduction of this compound into a crosslinked methacrylate polymer has significantly increased the ionic conductivity of Li+/polymer system. A star-shaped polymer based on hexakis [4-formylphenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene was utilized as the cathode material in a lithium-ion battery, which increased its capacity and energy density [32]. Oximes obtained from formylphenoxyphosphazene [33] have demonstrated a high dielectric constant, which makes them a promising material for multifunctional optoelectronic devices. Azomethine derivatives of hexakis [4-formylphenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene [34] and hexakis [2-formylphenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene [35] possess luminescent properties.
In addition, formylphenoxyphosphazenes can be utilized in the production of epoxy resins with enhanced thermal and fire resistance. Aldehyde groups can be oxidized to carboxylic ones with a subsequent reaction of acid groups with epichlorohydrin [36]. Another method to obtain epoxy derivatives is a reduction of the aldehyde groups to alcohol ones followed by a reaction with diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A [37].
The present work was aimed at the structural analysis of hexakis [2-formylphenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene. The reported data will allow one to perform structural calculations for the compounds synthesized from hexakis [2-formylphenoxy]cyclotriphosphazene (2-FP) [38], to predict their properties, and to explain various phenomena caused by specific interactions [39].
