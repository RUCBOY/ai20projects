Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecologic malignancies. In recent years, the incidence of cervical cancer has been increasing year by year, and the age of onset tends to be younger. Therefore, the prevention and treatment of cervical cancer have become a hot topic in academia. Driven by the fourth revolution in healthcare technologies [1], [2], led by the boom of Big Data [3], [4] and Machine Learning/Deep Learning [5], [6], [7], Health engineering is emerging as a new interdisciplinary field of research and development [8], [9]. This may lead to a revolutionized healthcare system that enables the participation of all people for the early detection and prevention of diseases. In this manner, preemptive and proactive treatments can be delivered to realize the personalized, pervasive, and patient-centralized healthcare.
At present, cervical cytology screening has been widely used, so that the cervical cancer and precancerous lesions can be detected and treated early, thereby significantly decreasing the morbidity and mortality of cervical cancer. Among numerous cervical cancer screening methods, Pap smear [10], [11] has been considered one of the most effective methods of cytology testing for early screening of cervical cancer. The essence of cervical cancer screening based on Pap smear is to extract and analyze the characteristics of cells or nuclei. As the basic step of quantitative analysis of cell or nucleus morphology, image segmentation [12], [13] plays a core role because the accuracy of the segmentation directly affects the correctness of analysis results.
1.1. Related workThere are many cell or nuclei image segmentation methods, which can be generally divided into three categories.First, cell or nucleus segmentation methods adopt region information to classify each pixel in an image. Typical nucleus segmentation methods include threshold methods [14], [15], region growing [16], [17], clustering [18], [19] and watershed algorithms [20], [21], [22].Second, segmentation methods using cell or nucleus edge information utilize the discontinuity of gray information to segment the image; they mainly include differential operator methods and active contour models [23], [24], [25], [26], [27].Third, cell or nucleus segmentation methods are mainly based on related theories [28], [29], such as wavelet analysis [30], [31], mathematical morphology [32], [33], [34], genetic algorithm [35] and neural networks [36], [37], [38].In addition, many state-of-the-art cell or nuclei segmentation algorithms are no longer based on a single algorithm but multiple algorithms together, namely, fusion algorithms, which aim to make up for the shortage of a single algorithm and achieve better segmentation results [39], [40].Due to the differences of slice-making and staining techniques, the quality of cervical smears is varied (either good or bad), e.g., uneven staining and complex background of the smear images. In addition, both irregular cervical cell shape and overlapping cells bring difficulties in the direct segmentation of whole cervical cells.For the highly-overlapping cell clusters, only first segmenting and then analyzing cervical nuclei can also be used for cervical cancer screening. On one hand, nuclei of cancer cells contain most of the features of pathological changes. Thus, quantitative analysis of nucleus morphology is reliable while it does not affect the cervical cancer cells screening results. On the other hand, it reduces the difficulty of segmentation and simplifies the operation process.Therefore, many classical algorithms have been developed for cervical nucleus segmentation. For instance, Plissiti et al. [41] used morphological reconstruction and clustering to detect cell nuclei from region of interest (ROI) produced by the Otsu threshold method. Zhang et al. [42] combined fully convolutional networks with a graph-based approach for segmentation of cervical nuclei. Plissiti et al. [43] presented a two-step fully-automated method for the segmentation of the nuclei. In the first stage, based on a morphological image reconstruction process, locations of nuclei were detected. In the second stage, the watershed transform was applied to the morphological color gradient image to segment nuclei boundaries. Byju et al. [44] used a customized Laplacian of Gaussian filter to detect the edge of nucleus and then segment the nucleus. Song et al. [45] proposed a method for segmentation of cervical cytoplasm and nuclei; this method combines a multi-scale convolutional network with graph partitioning. Muhimmah et al. [46] utilized morphological operations and watershed transformation to segment nuclei. Chang et al. [47] proposed a nucleus detection algorithm using mean shift and the energy method. Zhang et al. [48] presented a global and local scheme based on graph cut for segmentation of cytoplasm and nuclei.Most of the algorithms aforementioned perform the segmentation directly on the original image, which may result in the loss of the cell nuclei with low-intensity contrast. As shown in Fig. 1, the unclear boundaries of the nuclei with poor contrast against the cytoplasm makes it more difficult to achieve precise segmentation results. Guan et al. [49] first enhanced the nuclei according to the features of the images, then employed the morphological reconstruction and geometric features to screen out the nuclei. Kaur et al. [50] combined a multi-scale top hat filter and h-maxima to improve the contrast of the images and further adopted a curvelet initialized level set method to detect nuclei boundaries. Vigueras-Guillen et al. [51] used support vector machines (SVM) for segmenting low contrast corneal endothelium images. Wang et al. [52] proposed a nuclei segment qualifier based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and the linear iterative clustering superpixel method to deal with the low contrast.Download : Download high-res image (142KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

1.2. Motivation and contributionsOn the basis of learning and summarizing the results of previous studies, we propose an automatic method for cervical nuclei segmentation from cell clusters directly. It aims to improve the accuracy of cell nucleus segmentation and simplify the working process.The contributions of this paper are as follows:1.SEENS effectively integrates selective search to segment large cervical cell images into multiple small ROI automatically, which not only eliminates the process of manually clipping large images, but also simplifies multiple objects segmentation into single object segmentation, thereby reducing the subsequent fine segmentation difficulty.2.To the best of our knowledge, SEENS is the first proposal to apply double screening in ROI selections to avoid repeated segmentation and improve segmentation performance.3.SEENS improves the segmentation results of the cell images in low contrast scenarios.4.We have collaborated with medical professionals in establishing a real-world clinical dataset, with thorough ground-truth labeling.The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the proposed method. In Section 3, experimental results are presented and analyzed. This paper is summarized in Section 4.
