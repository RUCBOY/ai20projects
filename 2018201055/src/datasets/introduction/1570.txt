Corrosion phenomenon always has been a permanent and also imposing-cost drawback for industries on large or small scales. It is crystal clear that the corrosion consequences are the main cause of wasting energy and investment [1,2]. Acid pickling is a conventional way for cleaning the surfaces of the metallic substance and also removing the former scaling layer on a substrate in different fields such as chemical, power plants, nuclear, and oil industries, which result in unwanted corrosion as a side-effect [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. The corrosion rate of the metal species during the pickling process can be simply altered by adding a corrosion inhibitor into the acidic environment. The corrosion inhibitors can be in different states of matter like gas, solid, and liquid. They can postpone the anodic and cathodic reactions via creating a thin impermeable layer on the surface [7,8]. The majority of these inhibitors are poisonous and detrimental to the environment, and their existence in wastewater can cause many ecological problems. Nevertheless, the consciousness of the environment among the people has been raised in the new millennium by increasing sustainable development tactics. Thus, non-polluting/low-toxicity is an essential factor for industrial product development and commercial marketing of the corrosion inhibitors [9].
To solve the drawback of toxicity and nature pollution, the employment of green inhibitors is a recently developed strategy that has possessed huge consideration in the field of metal corrosion protection. They are cost-effective regarding their abundance in nature and almost composed of non-toxic substances [[10], [11], [12]]. One of the main sources of green inhibitors is plants. These green sources, because of having numerous oxygenated functional groups and also many electronegative atoms such as nitrogen and sulfur, i.e. in serotonin and tannin compounds, could adsorb on the metallic substrate, resulting in the production of a protective coating [13,14].
The corrosion protection ability for plenty of extracts consisting of Bambusa arundinacea leaves [13], Lavandula angustifolia [15], Thymus vulgaris [10], Matricaria recutita [16], Dacryodis edulis [17], Thymus vulgaris [10], Saffron [18], Carum carvi [19], Valeriana wallichii [20], Allium sativum [14], Salvia officinalis [21], Menthe pulegium [22], Sunflower seed hull [23], Neem [12], Tamarindus indiaca [24], Thymus algeriensis [25], ginger [26], Longan seed/peel [27], Saraca ashoka [28], licorice [29], Lagerstroemia speciosa leaf [30], Tagetes erecta [11] have been investigated until present.
Artichoke with the scientific name (Cynara scolymus L) is a plant of chicory category [47]. It is one of the oldest medicinal plants in the world that has been cultivated for thousands of years [31]. It is called artichoke in the English language and Kangar Farangi, Angaar, or Ardeshahi in the Persian language [31]. The mentioned plant grows natively in the south of Europe, the Mediterranean, and also north of Africa and the Canary Islands [31]. It does not grow in Iran naturally. Artichoke is farmed in a special part of Iran like Qazvin and Andimeshk, on a limited scale. The roots and aerial parts of the artichoke are also used. Dry leaves of Artichoke contain 9–11% water, 12–15% minerals, and are rich sources of potassium and magnesium salts [31]. Many diverse compounds like phenolic, flavonoid parts (0.1–1%) maltodextrin, and acidic components (decanoic acid, kainic acid, methyl ester hexadecanoic acid, and chlorogenic acid) are detected in its chemical structure [31,32].
Artichoke has a wide array of applications such as: anti-cancer effect [33], treatment of liver disease [34] and gastrointestinal disorders [35], antioxidant effect [36], anti-inflammatory [37], anti-obesity [38], anti-fungal [39], reduction of lipid levels in blood (cholesterol) which is good for cardiovascular health [31]. Hitherto, no study is reported on the effects of Artichoke. addition to HCl solution for the corrosion control of MS (mild steel). Hence, it's been decided in this study to assess the inhibition ability of various concentrations of Artichoke in HCl on MS. The main objective was to develop green/bio-degradable inhibitors with excellent inhibition effect and cost-effectiveness by optimizing the concentration, and then the protection mechanism of MS in HCl was assessed. In this regard, electrochemical and surface analysis tests were performed for confirming the inhibition ability. Theoretical calculations were also performed to investigate the adsorption mechanisms.
