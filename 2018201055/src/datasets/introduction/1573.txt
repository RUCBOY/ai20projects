The mechanical properties, reasonable malleability, and economic aspects of mild steel (MS) have made it as the first-rate material for lots of industrial applications like petrochemical fields, agriculture, and civil construction. However, the corrosion phenomenon imposes irreversible effects on its unique properties and causes the metal loss, unwanted failures, and imperfections [1]. In particular, the pitting corrosion has been frequently reported in cooling water systems, heat exchangers, storage tanks, and pipelines in which the chloride-containing solutions are in contact with the metal surface. So, various methods have been suggested to mitigate the corrosion effect like cathodic/anodic protection [2], protective coatings [3], and corrosion inhibitors [4]. The application of each survey depends on some specific factors [5]. All in all, the corrosion inhibitors have been enticed enormously owing to the considerable corrosion rate decrement by employing only a low concentration of the inhibitor in the corrosive media [[6], [7], [8]]. While most of the synthetic inhibitors are not cheap enough and have some serious impact on the human being and the environment. Regarding this matter, some nations have prohibited the usage of phosphates, Cr6+, and azole containing compounds [9]. Therefore, some replacements have been directed, such as rare earth salts like Nd, Ce, Pr, etc. and biocompatible corrosion inhibitors [10,11], which are restricted due to the non-economic aspects and their unavailability [[12], [13], [14]].
The eco-friendly corrosion inhibitors have been attracted huge attention due to their low cost and high corrosion protection performance. Different parts of the plants and trees contain various organic compounds which can be considered as a source of heterocyclic or aromatic rings with different functional groups having plentiful heteroatoms [15,16]. A kind of anti-corrosive film could be established on the surface by the interactions between the organic compounds of green inhibitor and metal surface. In fact, this protective layer could be created either by sharing of electron lone pairs of heteroatoms with d-orbital of iron atoms or electrostatic attraction. The protective layer could hinder the approach of the corrosive species to the anodic and cathodic regions and retard the redox reactions on the substrate [[17], [18], [19]].
The corrosion protection performance of different parts of natural substances, including seed, flowers, roots, stems, leaves, etc. was scrutinized in the saline and acidic solutions by lots of scientists. Their achievements evidenced the effectiveness of the Tamarindus Indiaca [20], Juglans regia [21], and Primrose flower [22] in the saline solution and Tagetes erecta [23], Ginkgo leaf [24], Glycyrrhiza glabra [25], and Lemon Balm [26] in the acidic solutions on the MS substrate.
Numerous green inhibitors have been tested in acidic media; however, most of them did not provide high IE in the saline media [27]. In the previous studies, the addition of inorganic compounds such as zinc cations has been attracted attention to compensate for the inefficiency of theses green inhibitors in neutral media [[28], [29], [30]]. This assessment aims to figure out an awesome green inhibitor to provide high corrosion protection performance in neutral chloride solutions individually, and indeed, it would be an innovative method compared to the previous works.
Papaver sominiferum originates from the Papaveraceaes family distributed in the eastern Mediterranean and almost whole parts of Afghanistan. It consists of some N-based rich compounds like thebaine, papaverine, oripavine, noscapine, morphine, and codeine [[31], [32], [33]]. The morphine, codeine, and papaverine are proved to be applicable in antitussives, sedative, and pharmacology. While the addictive nature of Papaver sominiferum has been revealed [34]. Overall, the N-containing inhibitors (like Papaver sominiferum) have been widely recommended as the highly efficient compounds in the acid pickling process. Most of the Papaver sominiferum components are soluble in water, making it an ideal eco-friendly inhibitor [[35], [36], [37], [38]].
This work aims to scrutinize experimentally and theoretically, the effect of Papaver sominiferum extract (PSE) on the corrosion protection performance of the samples immersed in the neutral chloride solution. To this end, some surface characterization tests, including Raman, FT-IR, FE-SEM, GI-XRD, UVâ€“Vis, AFM, and CA were conducted. PPS and EIS tests were conducted to evaluate the electrochemical performance of the coupons. Furthermore, DFT, MD, MC techniques were employed as a theoretical part to complete the assessment.
