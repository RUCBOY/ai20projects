In the past decades, reasoning about knowledge and information change has gained a prominent place in various areas of artificial intelligence and computer science such as distributed systems [26], protocol verification [27], and game theory [3]. In these areas agents have to deal with incomplete and inconsistent information. For example, in distributed systems, agents receive information from multiple sources that may be inconsistent. Moreover, in real-world situations, agents do not have complete information about all aspects of the world and their reasoning power is bounded by thresholds such as time and limited memory [11]. Under such circumstances, applying a classical approach to model information change may not be appropriate because it suffers from the logical omniscience problem [46]; that is, the agents know all the consequences of what they know. As a result, they cannot hold contradictory knowledge without “knowing” every sentence of the language, because a contradiction classically entails any formula. Several approaches have been proposed to formalize inconsistent and incomplete information in the literature, see e.g. [6], [7], [31], [30], [11], [12]. To set the stage for future discussion, we are going to review the most closely related works. In [6] Belnap proposed a four-valued logic whose semantics involves, besides the classical truth values t and f, two intermediate values: ⊤ (both true and false) for handling inconsistent information and ⊥ (neither true nor false) for incomplete information. In this logic, each atomic formula can be assigned one of the four values chosen from the set 4={t,f,⊥,⊤}. Belnap observed that his four values can be arranged in a lattice in two ways: ordering them either by information degree (the knowledge order ≤k) or by the truth degree (the truth order ≤t). The set 4 together with ≤k and ≤t forms two complete lattices, which are shown in Fig. 1. Given two truth values x and y, x≤ty can be read as “y is at least as true as x”, while x≤ky means that “y contains at least as much information as x”.Download : Download high-res image (11KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Belnap's four-valued logic inspired Levesque to address the logical omniscience problem. In [31] he proposed a logic of explicit and implicit belief. Explicit beliefs are actively entertained by the agent, whereas implicit beliefs include the logical consequences of her explicit beliefs. This logic has a modality for explicit belief and a modality for implicit belief. The interpretation of these operators is based on situation semantics. Unlike in possible worlds, in a situation a sentence can be true, false, both true and false (incoherent situation), or neither true nor false (incomplete situation). From our perspective, [31] establishes a significant link between many-valued logics and epistemic logics. An objection raised against Levesque's model is that it is restricted to a single agent environment and therefore does not account for nested beliefs [37]. Fagin and Halpern address multi-agent belief in their logic of knowledge (or belief) and awareness [12]. The semantics of this awareness logic is based on possible worlds and does not allow the agents to have contradictory knowledge, but the awareness function at each possible world provides an effect that is similar to an incomplete situation. In [42], [43], Sim compares the approaches of [31] and [12] in detail and shows that the situations of [31] and the Kripke models with (un)awareness of [12] can be associated with a model based on a bilattice structure.
Bilattices are algebraic structures introduced by Ginsberg [22] to unify logical formalisms for default reasoning and non-monotonic reasoning. A bilattice is a set B equipped with two partial orders, the knowledge order (≤k) and the truth order (≤t), such that (B,≤k) and (B,≤t) are both complete lattices. The partial orders ≤k and ≤t have similar interpretations as in Belnap's logic. Belnap's four-element lattice is the smallest non-trivial bilattice. It is called FOUR. See Fig. 1.
Bilattices have found applications in different research areas such as logic programming [14], semantics of natural language questions [35] and philosophical logic [13], [17]. In the 1990s Arieli and Avron [1], [2] carried bilattices to a new stage introducing bilattice-based logical systems that are suitable for non-monotonic and paraconsistent reasoning. Later on, Jung and Rivieccio [28] introduced a modal expansion of the logic of [1] that can be used to reason about knowledge, belief, time, and obligation. The formulas of this logic are interpreted in Kripke frames wherein both the accessibility relation and the valuation function are four-valued. Four-valued accessibility relations go back to Fitting [15], [16], who suggested a family of many-valued modal logics and generalized Kripke models involving many-valued accessibility relations. He argued in [16] that many-valued accessibility relations are natural to formalize that some worlds alternative to the real world are more relevant than others.
A similar formalism to that of [28] was proposed in [36]. They studied a Belnapian version of the modal logic K. The semantics of this logic is based on Kripke models where valuations are four-valued (as in [28]), however, the accessibility relation is classical. Because of this, the modal operators of [36] differ from those of [28], although the propositional base of both logics is the same. The formalism of [28] is the more general, because one can define the modal operators of [36] in the language [28], but not the other way round [28, Prop. 2].
In this work we develop a bilattice-based modal logic with dynamic operators that enable us to reason about information change in the presence of incomplete or inconsistent information. We build our logic by combining the logic of epistemic action and knowledge (EAK) of [5] with the bilattice-valued modal logic of [28]. The logic EAK extends classical modal logic with an operator for reasoning about the effects of epistemic actions, as represented by action models. Epistemic actions are events by which agents receive new information about the world, whilst leaving the facts of the world itself unchanged. An action model is a relational structure similar to a Kripke model, where the accessibility relation between two actions (points in the action model domain) represent an agent's uncertainty as to which action actually occurred. The structure of action models should of course fit that of Kripke models, with four-valued accessibility relations. How to give intuitive interpretations to such four-valued action models is non-trivial, and we will give this ample attention.
Formally, epistemic changes are modeled via the so-called product update construction on the Kripke models that provides a relational semantics for EAK. Through the product update, a Kripke model encoding the current epistemic setup of a group of agents is replaced by an updated model.
An adequate formal treatment of EAK and dynamic epistemic logics, from a syntactic as well as a semantic point of view, faces non-trivial technical problems which become even more serious when moving to a non-classical setting [18]. Such problems can be addressed in an algebraic framework. An elegant and versatile approach to the algebraic treatment of dynamic epistemic logic has been developed in a recent series of papers [29], [32], [38], [39], [9], in which the authors define non-classical counterparts of dynamic logics.
The contribution of the present paper is that we extend the methods of [29], [38], [39] by introducing a suitable notion of product update on relational and algebraic models of bilattice modal logic, thus obtaining a semantics and a complete axiomatization for a bilattice-based version of EAK (called BEAK). We restrict ourselves to the single-agent setting, but the multi-agent generalization is straightforward. We provide motivating examples for our logic.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the necessary definitions and results on modal bilattice logic. It provides the static modal fragment on which we build our bilattice-based dynamic epistemic logic. Section 3 expounds the technical details of the update mechanism on the algebraic structures (modal bilattices), and introduces an algebraic semantics and a relational semantics for our logic, that are then shown to be equivalent via duality. In Section 4 we introduce a Hilbert-style calculus for BEAK, and we show its soundness and completeness. Completeness is shown by a reduction to the static fragment. Section 5 gives a detailed case study illustrating the usage of epistemic dynamics in a bilattice setting. Readers wishing to sharpen their intuitions on knowledge (change) and bilattices, or wanting to ascertain the relevance of our framework for such settings, are suggested to read this section earlier.
