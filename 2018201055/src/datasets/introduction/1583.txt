The low power cost and high performance, which are inversely proportional to each other, are important issues for the service providers and users of the systems, respectively [1], [2]. Hence, the mixed power and performance modeling in order to evaluate the impact of various factors on them is an issue that has attracted the attention of researchers. The factors affecting power consumption and performance of systems can be divided into two categories: hardware and software [3], [4]. In hardware level, CPUs, memories, storages, and network interfaces are the most important physical components that have been modeled to assess power consumption [5], [6], [7], [8]. An approximate distribution of peak power usage by components of a warehouse-scale computer shows that CPUs and network consume 33% and 5% of the total power consumption of a system, respectively [9]. The sum of the power consumption of memories and storages is 40% of the total power consumption [9]. In software level, operating systems, virtual machines (VMs) and software processes are the most important software components that have been modeled and analyzed in the viewpoint of power consumption [10], [11], [12], [13]. The software processes can be categorized into three main categories called compute-, data-, and communication-intensive, according to their required resources [14], [15], [16], [17]. The resource allocation algorithms and migration of processes are other factors affecting the power consumption of a virtualized system [18], [19], [20], [21].
Most of the research work done in this area usually use the regression and linear relationships to predict and calculate the total power consumption of a system. They often ignore the performance of the system and do not consider the important factors influencing on the system performance in their proposed models. In order to fulfill this requirement, a set of analytical models based on stochastic reward nets (SRNs) are proposed in this paper to evaluate the impact of resource allocation algorithms and migration of processes on the power consumption and performance of virtualized systems. The SRN formalism is a stochastic extension of Petri nets, and it provides a powerful way for modeling complex systems [22]. The main contributions of this paper are listed in the following.
•A mixed power and performance modeling approach is proposed for virtualized systems by considering the compute-, data-, and communication-intensive processes.•The effect of different resource allocation algorithms, e.g. First-fit, Best-fit, Worst-fit, and Random, is evaluated on both the power and performance.•The impact of process migration, when two power-aware and performance-aware methods are considered, is analyzed and the measures related to the power and performance are estimated for both methods.•The proposed models are used to compare a virtualized system which does not support migration with another one that applies migration to move processes among the resources.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background information on the concepts considered in this paper, e.g. virtualized systems, different types of processes, resource allocation algorithms, and migration methods. Furthermore, an overview of the SRN formalism and its supporting tool, SPNP [23], [24], is provided in this section. Section 3 introduces the related works in the field of modeling and evaluation of the power and performance of systems. Sections 4 and 5 present the proposed SRN models and the measures of interest that can be computed by applying the proposed models, respectively. In Section 6, different resource allocation algorithms and process migration methods are compared by analytically solving the proposed SRN models. Furthermore, the validation results against the CloudSim framework [25] are provided in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper and gives ideas for future work.
