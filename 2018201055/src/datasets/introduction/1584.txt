Online or electronic preprints with free availability make scientific exchange between scholars more convenient and timely, enabling researchers to gain frontier academic information and cite frontier research easily (Youngen, 1998; Haustein, Bowman & Costas, 2015). Since the establishment of arXiv.org (http://www.arXiv.org, previously the Los Alamos National Laboratory preprint server founded by Paul Ginsparg, now maintained and operated by Cornell University), online preprint study has become an important research area. Started in August 1991, arXiv has become a highly-automated electronic archive and distribution server for research articles. Originally, it was applied as a communication tool for high-energy physicists (Luzi, 1998), but it currently covers a large number of fields including physics, mathematics, computer science, quantitative biology, quantitative finance, statistics, electrical engineering and systems science, and economics. As a free and open platform for uploading and downloading scientific preprint manuscripts, arXiv provides a channel for researchers to disseminate their research findings, obtain full-text articles, acquire scientific priority for new ideas (Schwarz & Kennicutt, 2004), get more opportunities for scholarly communication (Youngen, 1998), and even gain more citations (Ale Ebrahim et al., 2013). Simultaneously, it can promote open access greatly and consequently create a profound impact in academia (Warner, 2003; Davis & Fromerth, 2007). It should be pointed out that arXiv interacts closely with other community-based services like the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Astrophysics Data System (ADS) and INSPIRE (high-energy physics information system) to provide references and citation information for scientists.
Posted preprints have won increasing attention from scholars over the past 20 years. Early studies explored the evolution from traditional preprint to e-prints1 (Jackson, 2002), the value of an internet-accessible preprint server in scholarly publishing and communication (Lim, 1996; Luzi, 1998), and the citation patterns for preprints (Youngen, 1998; Brown, 2001). Numerous other studies have discussed the impact of the arXiv repository on the citations of formal publications. Researchers have considered as examples journal articles in areas such as astrophysics (Schwarz & Kennicutt, 2004), mathematics (Davis & Fromerth, 2007), and condensed matter physics (Moed, 2007), and showed that, compared with non-deposited articles, the articles deposited in arXiv generally receive more citations. In other words, posting manuscripts to arXiv could help the corresponding published articles to be more highly cited. Three hypotheses, the open access postulate, early view postulate, and quality differential postulate (Lawrence, 2001; Kurtz et al., 2005b; Henneken et al., 2006; Davis & Fromerth, 2007), have been proposed to explain this phenomenon. Meanwhile, scholars have also pointed out that arXiv can influence the number of downloads from the publishers’ websites (Moed, 2007) because of the openness and accessibility of arXiv-deposited articles (i.e., the articles with both an arXiv version and a publisher version). Recently, researchers have investigated the elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication, and the citation impact of arXiv e-prints based on the arXiv server and the Web of Science repository (Larivière et al., 2014; Wang, Glänzel & Chen, 2018).
Nevertheless, the existing research ignores another important issue: that the citations received by an e-print deposited in arXiv (the arXiv version) can influence the citation statistics of the corresponding journal article (the publisher version), which means that the arXiv e-prints are likely to snatch some citation counts of journal articles. This means that a published version of an article may lose citations because of an arXiv version, with the lost citations counting for its e-print version. This raises the issue of how to integrate the citation counts for the arXiv version and the publisher version. From this question arise more detailed issues: Should the citations be accumulated solely into the publisher version or the arXiv version? Alternatively, should the citations from the two versions be counted separately? No previously published research has addressed this problem, and there exist obvious differences in handling the problem among the popular bibliographic repositories (e.g., Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, ADS, and INSPIRE). Google Scholar, ADS, and INSPIRE all attempt to integrate the citations from the two versions, but Web of Science and Scopus do not.
In this study, we focus on journal articles that also appeared as e-prints in the arXiv repository, and we explore the citation consolidation counts for the arXiv version and publisher version. This is the first study to systematically explore the citation consolidation of articles with both an arXiv version and a publisher version. It promotes the completeness and accuracy of citation counting. Thereby, this study tries to shed new light on the citation merging for different versions and further perfect citation statistics in practice.
