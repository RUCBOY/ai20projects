The design of new liquid crystal materials (LCs) has attracted a great deal of interest due to their versatile application areas such as microelectronics, especially for their optical data storage facilities and nonlinear optical properties [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. Because of the flexibility, self-assembly and stability in a large temperature range, LCs are a key component of display technologies. The quest for novel mesogens has become a challenge for the scientists to improve optical, mechanical and thermal properties of LCs and hence to widen their participation in applied technologies [[13], [14], [15], [16]]. In these systems, molecular interactions, which are stronger than van der Waals (vdW) interactions such as hydrogen bonding, ionic interactions, and charge transfer interactions, are the main driving force lying behind the molecular assembly, which make them eligible for applications in electronics. Particularly, hydrogen-bonding interactions significantly alter the intermolecular interactions and result in the notable impact on the phase behaviours of LCs [17]. H-bond is the most important non-covalent interaction, which plays an important role in the stabilization of the mesophases by assisting the molecules to align their dipole moments in the same direction since reverse dipoles cause destabilization [18]. Preparation of liquid crystalline complexes through hydrogen bonding is a very popular strategy and can be used for the synthesis of non-mesogenic and mesogenic compounds [[19], [20], [21], [22]] and trimeric liquid crystalline compounds [[23], [24], [25]]. One of the earliest examples of the hydrogen bonded liquid crystal system was binary complexes consisting of phenols or carboxylic acids as hydrogen donors and tertiary amines, such as pyridine derivatives as proton acceptors as introduced by Frechet et al. [3]. Depending on their molecular characteristics such as chain length or functionalities, hydrogen-bonded LCs have strong and diverse mesomorphic properties [12].
Urethanes and other carbamate derivatives have become highly preferred molecules because of their strong H-bonding capacities [26,27] since urethane serves as both H-bond donor via NH group and acceptor via CO group.
The objective of the present study is to utilize the H-bond accepting capacity of the carbonyl group of the urethane linkage and H-bond donating capacity of hydroxyl group of biphenyl-mesogens to synthesize a new material showing liquid crystalline behaviour. The newly synthesized system can be considered as a bridge between lyotropic mesomorphism formed by amphiphilic LC11 and the discrete thermotropic mesomorphism of supramolecular hydrogen bonded LC complexes [28]. Due to easy preparation, low cost, non-toxicity of urethane compounds, they can be suitable candidates for the LC display technology and may exhibit safe, effective performance with the reported mesomorphic properties altered simply by increasing the non-bonded interactions because of the H-bonding. The structure and the mesomorphic properties of synthesized liquid crystalline complex was characterized by FTIR, DSC and POM techniques. In order to explain the impact of H-bond on the mesomorphic properties, the structure of the H-bonded complex had to be elucidated since there are three H-bond formation possibilities between UR and LC11. For this purpose, theoretical calculations were needed. Firstly, three different H-bonded complex structures were modelled and their geometries were optimized by using Density Functional Theory (DFT) method. Then, the crystal structures of the complexes at room temperature were modelled and subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to compare the stability of complexes and to understand the impact of hydrogen bonding on the mesomorphic behaviour of the complexes and the temperature dependency of the transitions between the smectic and nematic mesophases. The experimental structure was estimated by comparing the experimental IR spectrum with the theoretical IR spectra of the three complexes. Two distinctive LC phases observed experimentally during cooling and also mesophase transition temperatures were also determined by the MD simulations and compared with the DSC and POM results.
