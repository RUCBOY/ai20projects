3D printing, commonly referred to as rapid prototyping (RP) or additive manufacturing (AM), is a manufacturing method in which materials are solidified in the form of layers to create three-dimensional (3D) physical objects from a 3D virtual model [1]. 3D printed objects are widely used in various medical fields, such as orthopedics, plastic surgery, neurosurgery, otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat surgery) and pulmonology (respiratory system) [2,3]. In the field of oral and maxillofacial surgery (Dentistry), 3D printed objects are used to reconstruct the deformed bone [4]. In oral and maxillofacial surgery, the reconstruction of the orbital fracture is challenging, and it is extremely difficult to regain its original structure [5]. Orbital fractures affect the position and function of intraorbital substances, leading to problems such as diplopia, enophthalmos and visual acuity disturbances [6]. To avoid these difficulties, it is necessary to surgically restore the fractured orbits and repair the pre-injury anatomy. Orbital fractures may lead to major problems with imprecise surgical replacements [7]. This study hopes to provide insight regarding the reconstruction of orbital floor fractures for accurate surgeries using 3D printing technology.
Many surgical methods have been adapted in previous studies (transconjunctival, subsidiary and coronal), and various materials have also been used to restore orbital fractures (bone, cartilage, titanium and resorbable mesh). The extant literature has provided various procedures for the reconstruction of orbital fractures [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. Despite the variety of surgical procedures, all of them have the same results, with slight similarities. Depending on the skill set of a surgeon, the process of fitting and aligning implants in the fractured orbital region is a reasonably time-consuming process [15]. Some researchers recently used autologous bone graft and titanium mesh, which are shaped according to the size of the 3D printed orbital models, to achieve a three-dimensional shape. It is fixed and aligned to match the contours of the orbital floor. Moreover, 3D printed orbital models are used in surgical procedures as surgical aids to help recognize anatomical landmarks and the exact fixation of titanium mesh [[16], [17], [18]]. Furthermore, the complex anatomical shape of the orbit makes the forming and cutting process of titanium mesh very laborious, and it is practically difficult to obtain a ‘true-to-original’ 3D shape. To avoid these problems, some authors have manufactured 3D printed customized orbital implants made of titanium powder, which can provide an exact anatomical shape of the orbital [19]. However, these implants are expensive and heavier than the weight of the orbital anatomy being replaced. Few authors have contributed to their research in weight optimization of orbital implants. These weight-optimized structural implants have also been manufactured using 3D printing with titanium powder [20]. 3D printed thermoplastic polymer models are used in pre-planning surgical procedures and as implants in the medical industry [[21], [22], [23]]. Biocompatible polymer implants can be used in orbital floor fractures to reduce weight during implant design. The use of thermoplastic polymer implants in treatment is affordable and economical. This paper explains a simple and reliable method for designing, manufacturing, and placing implants for the treatment of orbital fractures using computer-assisted simulation and 3D printing technology.
