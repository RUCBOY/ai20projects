The quest to develop quantum algorithms became of an utmost necessity to solve problems with high-cost solving time using classical computers. The superposition and quantum correlation of microscopic systems lead to unique features and capabilities [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] compared with macroscopic systems which usually act according to Newtonian mechanics. Entanglement [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] is a type of quantum correlation that appears if two quantum systems or more cannot be described independently, even when theyre disjointed by distance [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Entanglement phenomenon is a crucial resource in quantum computation [21], and its puzzling aspect is a characteristic property of quantum mechanics which was first pointed out by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in their seminal paper [22]. Entanglement offers a unique resource to perform several previously impossible operations such as quantum teleportation [26], [27]. Since the degree of entanglement is not plainly quantified, Wootters [28] proposed concurrence measurement that measures the degree of entanglement between two-body systems. Concurrence has been utilized for solving several quantum computing problems (see e.g., [29] and references therein).
In 1985, Deutsch presented the first algorithm that demonstrated how fast quantum algorithms can be in comparison with classical algorithms [30]. A set of quantum algorithms have been proposed since then which solve well-known intractable problems significantly faster than conventional algorithms[31], [32], [33], [34].
Quantum computers perform computations via one or more qubits through quantum circuits [21]. Unlike classical bits, qubits follow the two unique properties of quantum mechanics, namely superposition and entanglement. Moreover, teleportation becomes a source of quantum information, where the teleported quantum state is unknown in advance for both the sender and the receiver [35], [36]. Recently, teleportation of a quantum gate between two unknown qubits is realized experimentally [37]. Thus, quantum information becomes a more general form of information rather than classical information in classical computers. Consequently, quantum algorithms are needed not only to perform calculations faster on the quantum computers but to perform computations on quantum information too. Recently, K. Nagata et al. they claimed that they proposed an algorithm that uses a single measurement for determination the phase that can be used to differentiate between the functions f0,f1,f2,andf3; as a generalization of Deutsch’ algorithm. Nevertheless, they did not explained how their algorithm can do that. So their paper [38] can not be considered as a generalization for Deutsch’ algorithm.
In this paper, we go further from speed up solving classical problems by quantum computing to solving some problems which are intractable to be solved using classical computing. This paper proposes one of these problems which can not be solved using classical computers. Concretely, this paper extends the definition of Deutsch’s problem to decide whether a black box Uf applied on a given unknown qubit α|0〉+β|1〉, such that |α|>0,|β|>0,and|α|≠|β|, is constant or balanced Boolean function, besides, estimation of |α| and |β|. Although, this problem is very simple, however it can not be solved using classical computers because unknown qubits cannot be implemented physically on classical computers compared with Deutsch’s algorithm that can be simulated on classical computers with more computational effort. Then, we propose a novel algorithm based on concurrence measure to solve the proposed problem. In addition, the analysis of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated theoretically and proved experimentally using quantum state tomography. furthermore, the proposed algorithm is realized empirically on IBMs 5-qubit quantum computer with reliable fidelities.
In Section 2, we briefly review the standard Deutsch algorithm. Section 3 explains the problem definition. In Section 4, we briefly describe the techniques used in the proposed algorithm and the proposed application. Section 5 presents a full description of the proposed algorithm that solves the problem and its analysis. The error estimation of the proposed algorithm is investigated in Section 6. In Section 7, the realization of the proposed algorithm using IBM’s quantum computer, is implemented. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 8.
