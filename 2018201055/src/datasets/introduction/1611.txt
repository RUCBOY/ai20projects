Corrosion inhibitors' employment for metals/alloys corrosion deterioration restriction has attracted the attention of some researchers involved in corrosion phenomena [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Positive impacts of the organic molecules such as azole compounds on the corrosion inhibition of steel, Al alloys, and Cu metallic substrates in acidic media have been approved structures [5,[10], [11], [12]]. Besides acidic media, some steel structures are exposed to NaCl media, so the corrosion mitigation of the metals subjected to this environment should also be considered. The organic compounds, including heteroatoms, comprising of the electron-rich atoms like O, N, and S, polar groups, and conjugated bonds (i.e., CC), can act as inhibitors with high effectiveness for metals. They can retard the metals' corrosion reactivity through chemical/physical interactions with the atoms present in the vicinity of the metal surface [[13], [14], [15]]. The plants' leaves include active species that suppress the corrosion deterioration of metal substance in the acidic media [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. However, the organic moieties that highly tend to adsorb on the metallic surfaces in acidic media show a low tendency to adsorption on the metallic surface in neutral media like NaCl. Recently, the researchers have examined the synergistic corrosion inhibition of the organic inhibitors combined with inorganic species [15,20]. In our previous works, the extract of plants in combination with organic molecules was applied in saline media for achieving synergistic corrosion mitigation of metals [13,15,[21], [22], [23]].
In our recent study, the Ce3+ cations and green extract Nettle leaves (NLE) were combined as an eco-friendly mixture for getting a high efficiency of corrosion inhibition on the saline exposed steel substrate [15]. In another report [13], Bahlakeh et al. studied the synergistic corrosion retardation effect of Zn2+-Nettle, and their results showed a uniform film generation on the steel substrate surface exposed to the Zn2+ cations and NLE containing NaCl solution. In fact, the chelation between the functional groups containing electron-rich elements (such as NH2 and OH), and Fe2+/Zn2+ metal cations could result in the generation of the inhibitive film on the reactive sites of the metal surface which are exposed to the corrosive species. The positive inhibitive influence of some other complexes such as praseodymium nitrate (PrN), and Urtica dioica plant extract has been proved by Motamedi et al. [22].
Lemon balm (L.B) leaves that are categorized in Mint family have some applications such as herb for stress and anxiety as well as antioxidant properties in medicine science [24,25]. The main component of the plant's leaves includes chlorogenic acid, luteolin, rosmarinic acid. However, some other elements with similar compounds are also presented in the L.B extract [24]. The organic components of the leave's extract contain a high density of OH functional groups, which can react with cations.
Therefore, continuing the previous works, we have decided to examine the synergistic effect of the L.B leaves extract and Zn2+ ions mixtures for carbon steel corrosion mitigation in saline electrolyte using electrochemical tests such as DC-polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy associated with the surface analyses methods (like FE-SEM, contact angle, and AFM). Moreover, quantum mechanics computations (QM) and molecular dynamics simulation (MD), in combination with Monte Carlo (MC) were applied to seeking the interaction of complexes of Zn2+ and organic compounds of Lemon balm extract (L.B) over carbon steel specimens.
