Since its popularization by Janette Wing in 2006, computational thinking (CT) has gained a tremendous amount of attention from policymakers, educational researchers and practitioners as well as the general public, such as parents and computing enthusiasts around the world (National Research Council, 2011). In the United States, the Next Generation Science Standards (NRC, 2012) promoted CT as one of the Disciplinary Core Ideas for integrated K-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) instruction. In 2016, the US White House administration put forward the “Computer Science for All” initiative, which regarded CT as an essential skill that will empower all American students to thrive in the digital economy (the White House, 2016). To address the need for CT education in the K-12 context, some researchers developed stand-alone lessons on programming using robotics and visual, block-based programming tools (Berland & Wilensky, 2015; Bers, 2010; Bers, Flannery, Kazakoff, & Sullivan, 2014). Others made attempts to integrate computing in existing subjects such as mathematics (Israel, Wherfel, Pearson, Shehab, & Tapia, 2015; Weintrop et al., 2016). However, despite the effort made in defining and introducing CT in K-12 (Armoni & Gal-Ezer, 2014; Barr, Harrison, & Conery, 2011; Barr & Stephenson, 2011; Lee et al., 2011), a systematic review of the literature revealed that little has changed in our understanding of the development of children's CT skills going through the CT-focused educational interventions (Kalelioglu, Gülbahar, & Kukul, 2016). Therefore, this study aspired to understand through a qualitative lens how children's CT conceptions and practices evolved during CT learning experiences.
