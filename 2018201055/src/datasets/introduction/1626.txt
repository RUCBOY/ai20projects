Social media analytics is, “concerned with developing and evaluating informatics tools and frameworks to collect, monitor, analyze, summarize, and visualize social media data, usually driven by specific requirements from a target application” [1]. The global social media analytics market was valued at $3.07 billion in 2017 and is projected to grow to $16.37 billion by 2023 [2]. The analysis of social media is not limited just to business applications, but it is also used widely in academic research, e.g., [3] and [4]. One of the barriers to entry with regards to social media analytics is that conducting social media analytics requires an understanding of data science principles as well as a range of skills required to conduct these data science methods [5]. The Social Media Macroscope (SMM; www.socialmediamacroscope.org) helps to bridge this gap by providing intuitive web interfaces for conducting social media analytics. We describe the SMM in greater detail within this paper by focusing on two tools that we have made available within the SMM, namely the Social Media Intelligence and Learning Environment (SMILE) and the Brand Analytics Environment (BAE) [6]. One way to look at the SMM is to consider it an “app store” for open-source social media analytics apps/tools, although the apps/tools run directly within the “app store”. Before we look deeper into the two tools currently within the SMM, we provide a brief inventory of social media analytics tools previously made available to researchers, and how the SMM addresses gaps that exist with these tools.
