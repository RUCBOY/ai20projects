During the past decade, the graphene and its other derivatives (i.e., reduced-GO and functionalized graphene oxide, fGO) nanomaterials have attracted enormous scientists' attention due to their outstanding thermal/mechanical properties [1], [2]. Therefore, embedding the unique GO/rGO or fGO particles into the polymer-based structures to greatly improve their tensile/toughness as well as thermal characteristics has become the interesting subject of the recent studies [3], [4], [5]. For example, Jin et al. [6] explored that via GO sheets modification by Poly(butylene succinate), not only the particles' dispersion quality but also the fabricated composite mechanical properties were remarkably enhanced. Qian et al. [7] studied the effect of GO sheets functionalization by polyimide on their hydrophobic behavior. In another work, Wang et al. [8] explored that through the GO sheets modification by p-phenylenediamine, not only the particles' dispersibility but also the polyimide-based composite performance was significantly enhanced. Due to the high theoretical specific particle surface area of a monolayer GO sheet (>1000 m2/g) [9] well as the high intrinsic elastic modulus of this nanomaterial (about 207.6 ± 23.4 GPa) [10], the inclusion of these nanomaterials into the polymer matrix would result in significant mechanical properties enhancement. The dispersion/exfoliation level and the interfacial bonding of the polymer/GO-particles are two key influential parameters to fabricate high-performance polymer-based composites with outstanding thermal/mechanical properties [11], [12]. The presence of abundant oxygenated groups on the edge/basal-plane of GO particles prevents the particles from severe stacking but cannot provide strong interfacial adhesion bonding with the polymer structure. Due to the non-polar nature of most of the polymers and the high polarity of GO particles, the dispersion-level and interfacial adhesion bonding can be improved through the GO particles reduction and/or functionalization strategies [13], [14], [15]. The oxygen-containing groups (i.e., CO, COC) removal through the reduction procedures is a practical protocol for enhancing the non-polar nature of the nanosheets but causes the creation of multi-layer aggregated particles with poor process-ability in the polymer-based composites. Hydrazine (N2H4), sodium borohydride (NaBH₄), di-methylhydrazine (C2H8N2), and hydroquinone (C6H6O2) are some well-known reducing materials of GO that show high toxic/harmful activity [16], [17]. One solution for this matter is the replacement of the toxic reducing agents with some harmless/green compounds, i.e., Vitamin C (C6H8O6) [18], [19], and amino acid (i.e., Histamine) [20]. Despite the distinctive advantages of the conventional surface reduction/modification routs of GO on its dispersion improvement, most of the processes are complicated and need a large amount of expensive organic compounds. Therefore, finding a green/low-cost method to modify the particles is still a challenging item for the researchers. Recently, the plant-based (i.e., leaves, seeds, peels) extracts were utilized as a green source of the extensive phytochemicals, i.e., flavonoids for the reduction of graphene oxide. It has been shown that the phytoextracts of the plants show sufficient potential to reduce the GO particles' functional groups [21], [22], [23]. For example, in work conducted by Thakur and Karak [17], the aqueous extracts of Colocasia esculenta leaf and Citrus sinensis peel were prepared and applied as green phytochemicals for the GO oxygen-containing groups' reduction. As evidenced by the literature, the extracts of the mentioned materials include some important phytochemicals, i.e., flavonoids, apigenin (C15H10O5), ascorbic acid (C6H8O6), and luteolin (C15H10O6), that show high oxidation potency in the presence of the oxygen-containing (i.e., epoxide, CO, hydroxyl) groups of GO. The mentioned phytochemicals can be oxidized into quinone forms and, in this way, eliminate the oxygen-containing groups of GO [17], [19]. The Palm oil leaves aqueous extract [24], Indian gooseberry aqueous extract [25], eucalyptus leaf (EL) extract [26], Lycium barbarum (LB) extract [27], and Clove extract [28] are some examples of these.
Tamarindus indica (TI), also called tamarind, is a native to the African. The pulp of tamarind fruit has a sweet/sour tastes and has been used in traditional medicine. The presence of some active phytochemicals, i.e., Apigenin (C15H10O5), Eriodictyol (C15H12O6), Naringenin (C15H12O5), and Taxifolin (C15H12O7), in the tamarind extract have been proved in the past studies [29], [30]. The TIE components are not limited to the mentioned compounds. In work carried out by Sudjaroen et al. [29], the exact amounts of various polyphenolic compounds existed in the Tamarind seeds, and pericarp extracts were evaluated by various methods including chromatography–electrospray-ionisation-mass spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS), liquid chromatography (HPLC), 1H and 13C NMR and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). For example, their findings proved that about 73.4%, 1.4%, 7.4%, and 2% of the total phenols that exist in the TIE are related to the Proanthcyanidins, Naringenin, Taxifolin, and Apigenin, respectively. It seems that the unique phytochemicals that existed in TIE, i.e., Taxifolin, are an effective reducing agent for GO, as they can be oxidized into quinone forms. For the first time, the TIE potency for the GO oxygen-containing groups' reduction was studied. The rGO-TIE particles were then modified by zinc-metal cations for the development of hybrid metal-organic compounds on the rGO sheets. The rGO-TIE and rGO-TIE-Zn particles were characterized by different analytical methods, i.e., FT-IR, XRD, FE-SEM, and Raman. The rGO-TIE and rGO-TIE-Zn particles' impact on the epoxy-ester composite coating thermal/mechanical properties was studied by tensile, TGA, and DMTA methods. The composite film fracture morphology, as well as the dispersion degree of the particles in the coating, was analyzed by the FE-SEM technique.
