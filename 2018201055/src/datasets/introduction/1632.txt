The dominant Moore’s law [1] since 1975 is going to fail. It is no more valid to predict the speed and the scale of electronic devices. In 2010s channels of transistors were so short that scaling down was no more possible because of doping fluctuations, lithography issues, high leakage current, and speed limitation [2]. At the beginning of the new millennium, the term beyond-CMOS has been used frequently by scientists, and many pieces of research were launched to discover new methods on logic gates. Several review papers concentrate on the subject [3].
Successes in fabricating arrays of quantum dots with one or two extra electrons per dot and backgrounds on cellular automata were bases of introducing a new horizon to logic circuits and computation by Lent [4] et al. in 1990s. They demonstrated logic values 1 and 0 in a configuration of a quantum-dot cell containing electrons. High density circuits [5] having fast operation speed at Tera-Hertz frequencies together with low power dissipation are benefits that quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) brings into reality. They also found their route to security hardware as presented by Abutaleb et al. [6].
Although binary logic was the basis of machine-based calculation for decades, scientists always expect possibilities of applying multi-valued logic in computing [7]. QCAs also started their journey in the simplest format, i.e; binary cells [4], but soon it was found that geometries with multi-valued logic are achievable with them [8]. High data storage capabilities, faster arithmetic operations, better support for numerical analysis, uncertain and heuristic methods, communication protocols and efficient non-binary problem solving are the advantages of multi-value QCAs. [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].
Logic gates such as AND, OR, majority, full adder [15], etc. have been designed in binary QCA structure. Efforts on designing gates with the ternary structure were also performed [16], [17], [18], [19]. For bQCA, as a rule of thumb, having more operator facilitates the designing of sophisticated circuits. Although it is not necessary to develop new operands, a wide range of operands would help optimum designing of logical circuits.
Lebar et al. first introduced tQCA three–valued gates and Pecar et al. presented the basic architectural guidelines for them [20]. Their structure was simply an imitation of bQCA structures and at the first step, they used single phase clocking to run the gates. For this structure, it is crystal clear that for a set of symmetrical inputs like A, B, and A invalid output states are generated. They used a complex structure in which two identical gates played the role of input for the next gate. Pecar et al. utilized three phase clocking to overcome the effect of corner dots on output [16]. In three phase clocking, at the first clock, while input dots are held at fix state, the central dot could accept a superposition of their effects. Finally, when the central dot is kept at imposed state the input cells are switched relaxed and are neutral. Thus, the value of the central dot would transfer to output without the interference of input dots especially the corner one. Janez et al. located input, selector and output cells in diagonal layout [21]. By choosing this strategy the distance between dots are so that the corner effect is reduced. Tehrani et al. claims that by adding a single dot to the center of each cell in the structure proposed by Lebar, the desired result is achieved [18].
Nevertheless, CMOS technology is reaching its limits and new approaches such as QCA would overtake its role in computer circuit design. This technology needs a comprehensive study to introduce robust and reliable circuits. In this paper, we study the theoretical capability of utilizing tQCA by defining new types of gates. The main contribution of this paper is to provide Positive and Negative methodology, that is introduced to design any standard gates and circuits.
In this paper, first, we describe the computational model used to investigate the interactions of inter cellular quantum dots. Second, we propose a new design for P-AND, P-OR, N-AND, and N-OR. Then we calculate the distribution of charge for individual states. In the end, we conclude the specification of gates and show how it would enhance the designing of ternary QCA arithmetic.
