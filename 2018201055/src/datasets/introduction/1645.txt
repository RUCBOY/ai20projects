Coronavirus (COVID19) is a world-wide disease that has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on 11th March 2020. To date, Covid-19 disease counts more than 10 millions of confirmed cases, of which: more than 500 thousands of deaths around the world (mortality rate of 5.3%); more than 5 millions of recovered people. A quick diagnosis is fundamental to control the spread of the disease and increases the effectiveness of medical treatment and, consequently, the chances of survival without the necessity of intensive and sub-intensive care. This is a crucial point because hospitals have limited availability of equipment for intensive care. Viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the accepted standard diagnostic method. However, many countries are unable to provide the sufficient RT-PCR due to the fact that the disease is very contagious. So, only people with evident symptoms are tested. Moreover, it takes several hours to furnish a result. Therefore, faster and reliable screening techniques that could be further confirmed by the PCR test (or replace it) are required.
Computer tomography (CT) imaging is a valid alternative to detect COVID-19 [2] with a higher sensitivity [5] (up to 98% compared with 71% of RT-PCR). CT is likely to become increasingly important for the diagnosis and management of COVID-19 pneumonia, considering the continuous increments in global cases. Early research shows a pathological pathway that might be amenable to early CT detection, particularly if the patient is scanned 2 or more days after developing symptoms [2]. Nevertheless, the main bottleneck that radiologists experience in analysing radiography images is the visual scanning of small details. Moreover, a large number of CT images have to be evaluated in a very short time thus increasing the probability of misclassifications. This justifies the use of intelligent approaches that can automatically classify CT images of the chest.
Deep Learning methods have been extensively used in medical imaging. In particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used both for classification and segmentation problems, also of CT images [16]. However, CT images of the lungs referred to COVID-19 and not COVID-19 can be easily misclassified especially when damages due to pneumonia referred due to different causes are present at the same time. In fact, the main chest CT findings are pure ground glass opacities (GGO) [6] but also other lesions can be present like consolidations with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram [11]. As an example, two CT scans of COVID-19 and not COVID-19 are reported in Fig. 1a and b, respectively. Until now, there are limited datasets for COVID-19 and those available contain a limited number of CT images. For this reason, during the training phase it is necessary to avoid/reduce overfitting (that means the CNN is not learning the discriminant features of COVID-19 CT scans but only memorizing it). Another critical point is that CNN inference requires a lot of computational power. In fact, usually CNNs are executed on particularly expensive GPUs equipped with specific hardware acceleration systems. Anyway, expensive GPUs are still the exception rather than the norm in common computing clusters that usually are CPU based [13]. Even more, this type of machines could not be available in hospitals, especially in emergency situations and/or in developing Countries. At the moment, of the Top 12 Countries with more confirmed cases [12] (Table 1), 7 are developing Countries though COVID-19 emergency also is strongly stressing Health Systems of advanced Countries. In this work, we present an automatic method for recognizing COVID-19 and not COVID-19 CT images of lungs. It’s accuracy comparable with complex CNNs supported by massive pre-processing strategies while maintaining a light architecture and high efficiency that makes it executable in low/middle range computers.Download : Download high-res image (205KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

We started from the model of the SqueezeNet CNN to discriminate between COVID-19 and community-acquired pneumonia and/or healthy CT images. In fact, SqueezeNet is capable to reach the same accuracy of modern CNNs but with fewer parameters [7]. Moreover, in a recent benchmark [1], SqueezeNet has achieved the best accuracy density (accuracy divided by number of parameters) and the best inference time.
The hyperparameters have been optimized with Bayesian method on two datasets [17], [8]. In addition, Class Activation Mapping (CAM) [18] has been used to understand which parts of the image are relevant for the CNN to classify it and to check that no overfitting occurs.
The paper is structured as follow: in the next section (Materials and Methods) the datasets organization, the used processing equipment and the proposed methodology are presented; Section 3 contains Results and Discussion, including a comparison with recent works on the same argument; finally Section 4 concludes the paper and proposes future improvements.
