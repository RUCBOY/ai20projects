Computerized symbolic computation is a frontier inter-discipline including, but not limited to, mathematics, engineering, social sciences, and computer science [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. It is becoming a leader in modern computer science computing with its high-speed, stable, and accurate data processing capabilities and computing power. The essence of computerized symbolic computation is to resort to computers to help us complete mathematical calculations, reasoning, and proofs. In addition to algebra, the computer can also be used in other mathematical fields such as calculus and solving equations [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].
Generally, complicated mathematical calculation problems involved in the process of solving nonlinear equations are actually difficult to calculate the corresponding results using traditional calculation methods. Nowadays, the development of computer science including numerical calculation and symbolic computation is particularly rapid. For numerical calculation, it is an approximation method. The result obtained by that method is an approximate value rather than a real value, so numerical calculation is unreliable. By contrast, result of the computerized symbolic computation is a real value rather than an approximate value because of that the computer maps the processed objects and results into the form of symbols and formulas. Computerized symbolic computation focuses on analyzing and evolving problems. Through the design of related algorithms, the mathematical problem to be solved is symbolized first, and then the problem to be researched or calculated is settled [17], [18].
The use of computerized symbolic computation can make in-depth research on algebraic and digitized problems in mathematics and physics. Under such a premise, it is especially important to design a corresponding algorithm with reusability, reliability and high efficiency to solve practical problems in a computer-based symbolic computing system. It is worth mentioning that the application of soliton theory based on computerized symbolic computation has begun in 1980s. With the gradual study of Lie symmetry and Painlevé analysis of partial differential equations, some constructive algorithms on soliton theory have been proposed. Thus, computerized symbolic computation is gradually emerging in the research and analysis of soliton theory [19], [20], [21], [22].
In this paper, computerized symbolic computation has been used to solve the following variable coefficient high order nonlinear Schrödinger equation (vcHNLSE) [23],(1)iux+α2(x)(utt+2|u|2u)−iα3(x)(uttt+6|u|2ut)=0.Here, u(x, t) is the soliton envelope with the propagation distance x and retarded time t. α2(x) represents the group velocity dispersion (GVD) effect, and α3(x) represents the higher order dispersion and nonlinear effects. For Eq. (1), soliton periodic attenuating and oscillation has been studied [23]. However, interactions between solitons propagating in different directions have not been discussed.
This manuscript will be organized as follows. At first, analytic two-soliton solution will be given in Section 2. And then, interactions between solitons propagating in different directions will be discussed in Section 3. Finally, the conclusion will be made in Section 4.
