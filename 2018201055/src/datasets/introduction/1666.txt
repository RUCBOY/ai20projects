The vision of a human mission to Mars has long been fueled by our innate passion for exploration and discovery. Such a journey continues to be a central component of the U.S. space program, as NASA, along with its international and commercial partners, aims to land humans on the surface of the red planet in the 2030s (Bowersox, 2019; Smith, 2019). Around the globe, research platforms encompassing revolutionary advances in science and technology continue to get us one step closer.
The NASA-funded Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains (BASALT) program is conducting science-driven terrestrial field activities under Mars-mission operational conditions to broaden scientific knowledge regarding the habitability of basalt-rich terrains on Mars and to move the pendulum from Earth-reliant toward Earth-independent human exploration (Lim et al., 2019). The BASALT Science Operations and Technology teams are investigating candidate Mars extravehicular activity (EVA) concepts of operation (ConOps) and capabilities that enable and enhance scientific productivity (Beaton et al., 2019a, Beaton et al., 2019b). ConOps are operational design elements that guide the organization and flow of personnel, communications, hardware, software, and data to enable a mission concept. Capabilities are functional mission aspects and resources that take the form of hardware and software. Candidate Mars ConOps and capabilities testing and evaluation takes place during multiweek scientific field campaigns in Idaho and Hawai’i (Hughes et al., 2019), during which “Mars-based” extravehicular (EV) and intravehicular (IV) crewmembers conduct real (non-simulated) Mars-analog geobiochemical science while interacting with an “Earth-based” Mission Support Center (MSC) composed of expert scientists and operators across relevant Earth-to-Mars communication latencies (namely, 4–22 ​min one-way light time [OWLT]) (Beaton et al., 2017, Beaton et al., 2019b).
Each BASALT field test incorporates new operational design elements and technologies that build upon the iterative successes and lessons learned from previous field tests (Beaton et al., 2019b). A key finding of the BASALT project to-date is that despite significant communication latencies between Earth and Mars, meaningful intra-EVA (or during EVA) scientific collaborations and interactions between EVA crewmembers and remote scientists is both possible and beneficial (Beaton et al., 2017, Beaton et al., 2019b). This is accomplished through the strategic design and implementation of EVA timelines and supporting capabilities that are optimized in their phasing, tasking, and conditioning to support the highest degree of scientific return (see Brady et al. (2019); Stevens et al. (2019); Marquez et al. (2019); and Kobs Nawotniak et al., 2019 for details).
An evolving and exciting discussion point within the space exploration community is the potential application of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) capabilities, together and hereafter referred to as mixed reality (XR), in supporting future human missions to the moon and beyond. At the 2017 Explore Mars conference, a white paper spearheaded by experts from government and for-profit and non-profit sectors touted the need for XR applications ranging from pre-mission data visualization for science planning, to just-in-time crew training, to an immersive communication tool for collaboration between Earth and space-based crews (Carberry et al., 2017). While the paper outlines a list of ongoing research and activities focused on XR applications in the realms of crew operations and training, science and field operations, human factors and behavioral health, and outreach and public engagement, it also rightly puts forward the understanding that there is still a dearth of data to draw from to clearly outline the requirements and applications of an XR toolset in supporting future human missions.
During the November 2017 BASALT field deployment to the Kilauea Iki and Kilauea Caldera regions within Hawai’i Volcanoes National Park, hereafter referred to as the BASALT-3 field test, the BASALT team expanded their baseline test capabilities to evaluate the potential of three XR applications to support science and science operations (Beaton et al., 2019c):
1)BASALT-OnSight: an immersive, three-dimensional (3D), XR terrain modeling tool used by EVA crewmembers and missions support personnel to virtually explore the volcanic terrains of Hawai’i in a multi-user format from any location prior to EVA (Abercrombie et al., 2017b). This capability was used for terrain familiarization and training by the EVA crewmembers, EVA traverse and timeline planning by mission support scientists, and as a virtual telepresence system by IV and MSC personnel during the EVAs.2)HoloSkype: an AR technology that enables the drawing of virtual annotations on top of the real world by EV and IV crewmembers and facilitates real-time communication between them (Noor, 2016; Safi et al., 2019).3)HoloSEXTANT: an AR capability that provides real-time navigation and path planning visualization overlaid on the physical world for EV crewmembers (Anandapadmanaban et al., 2018; Marquez et al., 2019; Norheim et al., 2018b).
The results presented in this paper include foundational learning regarding the application of these three XR capabilities in support of pre-EVA and intra-EVA science and operations.
This paper begins with an overview of the BASALT-3 field test, including the ConOps and capabilities incorporated and evaluated, the assessment metrics employed, and a detailed description of field test execution. EVA timeline data and intra-EVA space-to-ground interaction data are presented to highlight differences in planned versus actual execution in the field. The paper then presents the full complement of subjective assessment data to address the foundational BASALT Science Operations research questions (defined in Section 1.1) and concludes with recommendations for complementary forward work.
1.1. Candidate Mars EVA concept of operations and capabilities evaluated during BASALT-3BASALT Science Operations research seek to address: Which ConOps and capabilities enable and enhance scientific return during human-robotic exploration under Mars-mission constraints? What improvements to these ConOps and capabilities are desired, warranted, or required? The operational design elements of the ConOps evaluated during BASALT field tests include the specific tasks that need to be accomplished and how they are organized into timelines and traverses; the roles, responsibilities, and distribution of personnel on “Mars” and on “Earth”; communication protocols defining the number and type of channels (e.g., space-to-ground-1 [SG-1] and space-to-ground-2 [SG-2]), mode of communication (e.g., voice, text message, video, still imagery, instrument data), temporal aspect of communication (e.g., real-time versus delayed), and senders and receivers; and flight rules that govern operations and safety. Capabilities refer to the hardware, software, and systems that support and enable the ConOps.1.1.1. Concept of operations incorporated in BASALT-3The baseline ConOps investigated during BASALT-3 focused on planetary EVA that integrates Earth-based scientific expertise within an EVA (intra-EVA). While ConOps that incorporate between-EVA (inter-EVA) Earth-based inputs are also viable for future Mars missions, intra-EVA SG interactions are advantageous when science objectives include exploring many regions of interest (the total number of which will be constrained by transport costs and consumables) or when science objectives limit repeat visits to a particular location (e.g., to reduce the potential for cross-contamination). Furthermore, the evaluation of ConOps that incorporate intra-EVA SG interactions directly challenges the presumption that latency and bandwidth constraints associated with missions beyond the Earth-moon system preclude meaningful intra-EVA SG communication and hence require nearly complete crew autonomy (Frank et al., 2016; Pohlkamp et al., 2015). From an EVA perspective, this translates into an assumption that SG interactions within an EVA, especially in the form of tactical scientific guidance, become more challenging as SG communication latency increases and data transmission allowance decreases. BASALT seeks to evaluate the ability of a team of expert, remote scientists to effectively and efficiently enhance scientific return during an EVA under Mars-relevant SG communication constraints.This particular ConOps is based on four key assumptions regarding future Mars scientific exploration EVA. First, it is assumed that robotic precursor missions will have collected relevant precursor data so that science exploration traverses to be conducted by human crews can be planned in advance of the crew arriving on site. Second, it is assumed that once crewmembers begin their EVA, they will obtain additional detailed information (i.e., beyond that provided by the precursor data), which may result in modifications to the science tasks and priorities. Third, it is assumed that higher levels of scientific expertise and analytical capabilities will reside on Earth than with the crew in space; although crewmembers will be highly trained and will be provided with as many relevant capabilities as practical, they will not be experts in everything given the vast breadth and depth of science objectives anticipated for future crewed missions (Eppler et al., 2013; Hodges and Schmitt, 2011). Therefore, it is also assumed that it will be advantageous for the crew to communicate with science experts on Earth to enhance and enable mission science return. The specifics regarding when, how, and how much of this communication should occur is a primary area the BASALT team is investigating and is related to the fourth assumption: that EVA timelines and traverses can be strategically designed to enable meaningful SG interactions within the EVA without increasing crew idle (i.e., unproductive) time.The communication architecture that will ultimately be in place for future human Mars missions will be based on a variety of scientific and operational factors balanced with programmatic considerations, including schedule and cost. The number and type of orbital and surface communication assets, whether or not coverage will be continuous or discontinuous, the amount of bandwidth available to transmit data between Earth and Mars, and the rate of such transmissions are still being determined (Berner et al., 2015; Drake, 2009; Miller et al., 2019; Seibert et al., 2019). It is also possible that the communication infrastructure and coverage will vary from mission to mission and from EVA to EVA, for example depending on where the crewmembers are located on the surface, what the EVA objectives are, etc. With respect to bandwidth, there are many factors that affect the size and quantity of EVA data products that might need to be passed between Earth and Mars. From purely a scientific perspective, examples of these factors include the scale of features being studied, the proximity of the crew to those features, camera resolution, compression algorithms, etc.For these reasons, a single communication latency of 5-min OWLT between the EVA crewmembers and the MSC was chosen for BASALT-3. Because bandwidth definition is largely unknown and the BASALT team is not incorporating flight hardware in the field (because it does not presently exist), our evaluations focused on the features and functions of capabilities that enable science and operations during an EVA and captured detailed network analytics, including the quantity and rate of all data products being passed across the network during the EVA, which can then be further investigated when details regarding communication architecture and flight hardware are better defined.Five advanced capabilities were incorporated into BASALT-3, described in detail in Table 1. These capabilities were used to distinguish five different ConOps, presented in Table 2, that were ultimately investigated during the BASALT-3 field test.Table 1. Additional Mars-forward capabilities incorporated and evaluated during BASALT-3.CapabilityFeatures and Functions EvaluatedBASALT-3 ImplementationSurface-based 360° imageryMobile, automated, high-resolution (1-cm resolution at distance of 10 ​m) 360° imagery captured from a vantage point of 3–4 ​m above ground at a particular time (relative to crew arrival) defined by the ConOps (see Table 2)Raw images taken at strategic locations of interest (defined in advance by BASALT scientists) using Nikon DSLR camera (f8, 28 ​mm, 45 ​MP) and Gigapan hardware from height of ~ 1.6 ​m. Images processed into 360° panoramas and presented to MSC scientists using COTS Gigapan software at specific times prescribed by the ConOps (see Table 2). MSC scientists annotated features of interest in the Gigapan images and sent these annotated images to the EVA crew. EV and IV crew viewed these images intra-EVA on their wrist displays and IV workstations, respectively, to locate and assess the annotated features as candidate samples.Surface-based LiDAR dataMobile, automated, high-resolution (1-cm at a distance of 10 ​m) LiDAR data captured from a vantage point of 3–4 ​m above ground at a particular time (relative to crew arrival) defined by the ConOps (see Table 2)LiDAR data captured of areas of interest by a Riegl Vz-400 terrestrial laser scanner mounted on a ~1.5 ​m tripod with scan resolutions of ~5 ​cm ​at 100 ​m from each scan position; LiDAR data processed into and combined with multispectral data into a 3D terrain model and perspective images by Riegl’s RiSCAN PRO software; terrain model and associated images provided to the MSC scientists at particular times defined by the ConOps (see Table 2) to assist in traverse planning and replanning.Immersive XR terrain environmentImmersive XR environment originally built from precursor data and updated in real-time with incoming intra-EVA data; provided to EVA crew for terrain familiarization and task practice pre-EVA and to IV crew and MSC scientists intra-EVA as a virtual telepresence systemBASALT-OnSight: Raw images of areas of interest taken from height of ~1.6m using Nikon DSLR camera (f8, 28 ​mm, 45 ​MP) and processed into a 3D terrain model using a combination of JPL-proprietary and COTS photogrammetry software; 3D terrain model presented to users via the Microsoft HoloLens.AR field navigation aidAR-based head-mounted display that overlays virtual planned traverse path and waypoints onto surrounding terrain for EV crew to use as a navigation aid in the fieldHoloSEXTANT: MIT SEXTANT software used 0.03–0.22 ​m DEMs and a metabolic energy expenditure model to calculate optimal traverse paths (Marquez et al., 2019); optimal traverse paths were displayed to EV via the Microsoft HoloLens as a virtual overlay on the terrain.Field-based AR annotation systemAR-based head-mounted display that enables EV and IV crew to overlay virtual text and annotations onto surrounding terrainHoloSkype: EV crew wore Microsoft HoloLens running HoloSkype software and connected to an in-field network that relayed information and enabled communication with the IV crew (Miller et al., 2019); IV crew monitored HoloSkype video on a Microsoft Surface tablet in the IV workstation and annotated the environment with virtual flags at candidate sample locations and guidance received from MSC scientists (e.g., locations for instrument scans and for sampling); EV crew observed the annotations via HoloSkype and also incorporated their own annotations.BASALT: Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains, DSLR: digital single light reflex, MSC: Mission Support Center, COTS: commercial off-the-shelf, LiDAR: light detection and ranging, JPL: Jet Propulsion Laboratory MIT: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, SEXTANT: Surface EXploration Traverse Analysis and Navigation Tool.Table 2.

See Section 1.1.2 for a summarized list of these capabilities and Table 1 of Beaton et al. (2019a) for additional details.1.1.2. Capabilities incorporated in BASALT-3A series of Mars-forward baseline capabilities facilitated pre-EVA planning, intra-EVA operations, and post-EVA data archiving and replanning during BASALT-3. These baseline capabilities were derived from the results and lessons learned of previous NASA analog programs (Abercromby et al., 2010, Abercromby et al., 2012a, Abercromby et al., 2013a, Abercromby et al., 2013b; Chappell et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2016), as well as the BASALT-1 and BASALT-2 field tests (Beaton et al., 2017, Beaton et al., 2019a, Beaton et al., 2019b). Intra-EVA capabilities supported communication and data transmission among the EV crew, IV crew, and MSC and enabled the scientific exploration and sampling to be completed. A detailed description of these baseline capabilities, their associated features and functions, and how they were implemented during BASALT are provided in Table 1 of Beaton et al. (2019a). Notable capabilities included:•Real-time (between EV and IV crew) and delayed (between EVA crew and MSC personnel) voice and text communication,•Real-time and delayed transmission of video data from EV crew chest-mounted video cameras and from a mobile situational awareness camera,•Real-time and delayed transmission of high resolution still imagery from EV crew handheld cameras,•Real-time and delayed transmission of scientific data from EV crew handheld scientific instruments (including a Fourier transform infrared spectroscope, near infrared spectrometer, portable x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, and forward-looking infrared camera (Sehlke et al., 2019)),•Real-time and delayed transmission of EV crew GPS position data (Miller et al., 2019),•Science presampling and sampling tools, including candidate sample location markers and sterile sampling tools (Stevens et al., 2019),•EV crew graphical wrist displays for viewing GPS position tracks, text messages, annotated images, and video feeds streaming from the chest-mounted cameras (Miller et al., 2019)•A dynamic leaderboard for organizing and tracking science priorities and objectives among the MSC and EVA crew (Kobs Nawotniak et al., 2019; Stevens et al., 2019),•Minerva – an integrated science support tool comprised of the Exploration Ground Data System (xGDS) software package (Deans et al., 2017), Playbook timeline management tool (Marquez et al., 2013), and SEXTANT traverse optimization tool (Norheim et al., 2018a). Minerva enables the creation, modification, and display of EVA traverses and timelines. It includes a tactical EVA timeline management tool to automatically track overall EVA times (e.g., time elapsed and time remaining) and critical task times, and provides a sophisticated science operations management platform and repository for scientific data, imagery, and field notes (Marquez et al., 2019).Based on recommendations stemming from the BASALT-2 field test, five new capabilities were incorporated into the BASALT-3 field test and are described in detail in Table 1.
