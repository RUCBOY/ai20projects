Chemistry is an essential basis for everyday lives and is considered as a central science. Its understanding allows us to perceive the world around us. It is necessary for figuring out many other sciences such as chemical engineering, material sciences, environmental science, and health science. However, other researchers have reported that Organic Chemistry is a difficult subject for students who pursue their education in these careers for different reasons [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. For example, Ellis [13] says there are three main difficulties for those learning Organic Chemistry: “there are no problem-solving algorithms; it requires three-dimensional thinking; and it has an extensive new vocabulary”. On the other hand, Millar [14] categorized learner difficulties into two domains: intrinsic and extrinsic difficulties.
Eticha and Ochonogor [12] investigated the specific areas of difficulty in Organic Chemistry topics for undergraduate students. The findings identified the organic reactions as one of the three topics of Organic Chemistry as the most difficult subject for students. The high school and undergraduate learners’ perceived difficulty of reactions and synthesis is consistent with our experience in more than two decades of teaching Organic Chemistry II to college students.
The discipline Organic Chemistry II, which addresses organic compounds’ main reactions, is taught to students of the Chemical Engineering, Chemistry, and Pharmacy courses at the Federal University of Ceará in Brazil. The high number of chemical reactions addressed in the discipline has been a torment for students, resulting in a percentage of unsuccessful learning and dropouts of around 50–60%, making organic reactions considered the most challenging subject in those courses’ curricula.
As chemistry educators, we need to recognize students’ difficulties in learning this subject and seek teaching strategies to overcome them. One possible way to change this paradigm involves using educational games, which have been commonly used to raise students’ interest levels and ensure that they actively participate in the learning process [15], [16].
The current generation of students has made smartphones a fundamental tool in their lives, using them to exchange messages, watch videos, listen to music, search for information on the internet, and play games. All of these valuable resources have enormous potential for use in chemical education. Therefore, another possible way to change this paradigm includes integrating smartphones and apps into the course curriculum and classroom instruction [17], [18], [19].
Given the growing popularity of smartphones among young people, it did not take long for educators to develop educational applications and include them in the curriculum of courses and classroom instruction, making learning more natural and convenient [17], [18], [20].
Libman and Huang [21] reviewed most of the free-of-charge and popular apps available on chemistry by breaking them down into nine categories based on their features. Among them, there are the Flash Cards and the Gaming Apps. The first one helps students memorize, which can be recorded on flashcards for self-test and reinforce memory. The gaming apps tend to attract younger users through elaborate graphic design and interactivity in games. Playing a chemistry-themed game is a relaxing experience that can motivate students to explore and use chemical concepts in a stimulating and fun way, making studying a more enjoyable task [16], [22]. Indeed, when learning activities of chemistry concepts are combined with games in the classroom, they result in students’ greater motivation [1], [22] or better performance [23], [21], making them more engaged in learning.
Our experience in the development and use of educational games [24], [25], [26], [27], [28] has also shown us the effectiveness of games on motivation and improving student performance compared to the well-known traditional methodologies. For example, the Chemical Nomenclature [29], [30] is an app in a quiz format where students try to answer several questions in competition with the gaming system. This game has helped students review organic and inorganic species’ nomenclature with good results in their learning [25].
This scenario motivated us to design an app in a quiz format similar to Chemical Nomenclature [29], [30] to help students revising the organic reactions in a playful way.
