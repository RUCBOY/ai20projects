Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells applied at the interfaces of n-type/Si and p-type/Si (n- and p-layers) through an intrinsic thin amorphous silicon layer (i-layer) has appealed significant consciousness owing to their high energy conversion efficiency and inferior thermal budget in comparison with conventional crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. SHJ solar cells have become the cutting-edge research over the last 20 years because of certain advantages, namely, a higher performance stability, low degradation, cost efficiency, a short production process, a high open-circuit voltage (VOC) compared with conventional homojunction c-Si cells, and a low processing temperature [9,10]. To date, the highest efficiency achieved in an SHJ solar cell has been reported to be approximately 26.63 % [11]. Various attempts at further improving the efficiency of SHJ solar cells have been made by emphasizing certain aspects, namely, reductions in the material cost and carrier collection loss by employing a thinner wafer, a reduction in the parasitic absorption loss by optimizing the silver grid electrode at the front side through a higher conductivity and aspect ratio, and the use of a superior quality surface passivation for a reduction of the carrier recombination losses.
We studied a rear emitter SHJ (RE-SHJ) structure, and achieved greater superiority than that of a front emitter SHJ structure [12]. In the case of a front emitter structure, the p-layer thickness should be resolute while considering the electrical properties and absorption losses of the p-layer. A p-type SHJ emitter is luminous at the front emitter, which is powerfully achieved through the parasitic absorption within the SHJ layers. Optimization of the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) and a-Si:H at the front stack is tricky because it occurs at the cost of the fill factor (FF) and VOC [13]. In addition, the doping of the a-Si:H layers is strongly related to the performance of the device. A thick layer and sufficient doping has to be preferred for higher built-in voltage [14,15]. Nevertheless, with high doping, the junction recombination can be enhanced [16], and above a certain level of doping concentration, VOC will decrease. A key problem is the establishment of a Schottky barrier among the interfaces of the n-type TCO with p-type a-Si:H. To describe the Schottky barrier, a thick layer and the maximum a-Si:H doping are needed, which can result in a trade-off among FF, the current density (JSC), and VOC [13,17].
Thus, to overcome the consequences of some of the issues described above, we chose the application of a RE-SHJ, which has a low parasitic absorption at the front [[18], [19], [20]]. Thus, optimization of the RE-SHJ can be mostly confined to the interface, carrier transport and recombination. A broad range of contact layers can be utilized, and an extremely conductive TCO for a contact layer, essential for the lateral conductivity of an SHJ solar cell at the front side. Thus, assuming the interface properties, the best possible doped a-Si:H layer is clearly simplified [18,21,22]. Still, based on the conditions of JSC, the TCO is excluded at the rear, which behaves chiefly as an optical layer through a decline of the parasitic absorption into the rear metal. The choice is limited for the rear metal as a candidate to maintain the minimum optical losses.
The maximum efficiency of a practical RE-SHJ solar cell is 23.43 % at present [23]. It is difficult to investigate each parameter thoroughly with regard to its effect on the device performance experimentally because of the large number of processing variables required, such as the work function, the optical band gap (Eg), doping density of the a-Si:H, and the band alignment of a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction, etc. Nevertheless, a systematic optimization of these fundamental parameters is still required to improve the efficiency of RE-SHJ solar cells. A simulation program based on the automat for simulation of heterostructures (AFORS-HET), applied to evaluate the limitation of the conversion efficiency, provides a convenient way to accurately evaluate the roles of various parameters [[24], [25], [26]]. In particular, we investigated the influences of the parameters on an FSF layer in RE-SHJ solar cells, in which the TCO layer was fixed to optimize an n-type μc-Si:H. After running the simulation for the optimization of the n-type μc-Si:H, we also carried out a comparison of the other band gap materials having different Eg, such as a-Si:H and μc-SiO:H, for a high-efficiency solar cell. Accordingly, the design optimization of an RE-SHJ solar cell on an n-type substrate for further improvement of the efficiency is described.
