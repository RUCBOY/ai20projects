Over the last decades, partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs) have catched much attention of the scientists and researchers, who study on applied sciences, such as mathematics, engineering, pro-viscoelastic media, electromagnetic theory, geophysics, heat conduction, transport problems and radiation propagation [7], [16], [22], [26], [27], [37]. PIDEs play an important role in modeling the real world problems since they contain spatial and time derivatives along with integral form. Thereby, PIDEs simulate the physical meaning of these problems in every aspect. For example, PIDEs of Barbashin type occur widely in mathematics, physics, engineering, radiation propagation, mathematical biology and transport problems [7], [14]. On the other hand, it is well known that the complex problems have been entirely treated with the development of fractional calculus. Fractional calculus provides a noninteger derivative aspect of mathematical functions, which enables us to investigate a problem for its different physical response depending on a unusual time and space derivatives. The applications of fractional differential equations (FDEs) have recently increased due to the change of representation of the so-called phenomena arising in fluid mechanics [38], viscoelasticity [38], physics [30] etc. It has been noticed from these attempts that the considered problems of fractional order provide much better response than the integer ones. Recent studies and developments for fractional calculus can be described as follows: a class of FDEs has been treated by the fractional-order Lagrange polynomials [39], the general Lagrange scaling functions have been deployed to solve some classes of FDEs and their delay forms [40], a hybrid approach based on the fractional order Fibonacci polynomials and block pulse functions has been used to solve FDEs of delay type [41] and Müntz-Legendre hybrid functions have been presented to consider fractional order partial differential equations numerically [42]. From this point of view, in this study, we aim to consider the space-time fractional partial integro-differential equations with spatial-time delays (FPIDDEs), which contain a wide class of PIDEs occurring in mathematical physics and biology [7], [14], nuclear science [4], heat transfer [5], finance [43]. However, there is a difficult task to analytically treat these mentioned problems. Thus, it is required that a numerical procedure is established. So far, very few procedures dealing numerically with fractional PIDEs have been proposed. Some of them are the pseudo numerical method based on the operational matrices and Genocchi functions [18], the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method [6], the finite difference θ-method [10] and the iterative algorithmic method [8]. In [36], we introduced a novel method based on matrix collocation computation and matching polynomials for different graph classes to solve fractional differential equations with multi delays. In [34], we established the advanced matrix relations of the method involving the matching polynomial of complete graph, in order to treat the partial differential equations of space-time fractional order and multi delays. Now, we here introduce a modified version of the latter method, which yields the fast computation while solving FPIDDEs. It is also worth specifying that the effect of delay phenomena on these equations arouses curiosity and changes physical behavior of the equation with respect to time or spatial scale. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it converts the mathematical functions in FPIDDEs into their matrix expansions at collocation points directly. Thereby, the linear algebraical system of a matrix equation composed of matrix expansions can be eliminated and so the approximate solution is uniquely determined without implementing any recursive operations. In addition, due to durable structure of complete graph, the proposed method yields consistent outcomes while using high computation limits.
Now, we treat FPIDDEs in Ω={(x,t):x∈[a,b],t∈[c,d]}⊂R2 as(1)Pαk∂αku(x,t)∂tαk+Qβk∂βku(x−τβk,t−σβk)∂xβk=g(x,t)+λf∫abKf(x,t,s)u(x,s)ds+λv∫atKv(x,t,s)u(x,s)ds, subject to the Dirichlet boundary conditions(2)u(a,t)=c1(t)andu(b,t)=c2(t)on∂Ω, where 0<αk≤3, 0≤βk≤2(k=0,1) are fractional derivatives in the Caputo sense, the delays τβk,σβk≥0 and {Pαk,Qβk,λf,λv} are real coefficients, the kernel functions {Kf(x,t,s),Kv(x,t,s)}, u(x,t), g(x,t) are analytic functions on Ω.
Eq. (1) can be reduced to some specific problems, such as PIDEs of diffusion and Barbashin types [7], [11], [14], multi-term time fractional PIDEs with spatial-time delays, and so on. It is important to state that Barbashin type PIDEs [7], [14] arising in radiation propagation, mathematical biology and transport problems can be derived from Eq. (1).
Alternatively, Eq. (1) can be written briefly as(3)D(x,t)=g(x,t)+λfIf(x,t)+λvIv(x,t), whereD(x,t)=Pαk∂αku(x,t)∂tαk+Qβk∂βku(x−τβk,t−σβk)∂xβk,If(x,t)=∫abKf(x,t,s)u(x,s)ds, andIv(x,t)=∫atKv(x,t,s)u(x,s)ds, such that D(x,t), If(x,t) and Iv(x,t) represent differential, Fredholm and Volterra integral parts of Eq. (1), respectively.
Our aim is to constitute an effective and fast numerical method dependent upon the matching polynomial and matrix-collocation procedure to solve Eq. (1). In doing so, we seek its approximate solution of the form (see [34])(4)u(x,t)≅uN(x,t)=∑p=0N∑q=0NypqMpq(Kp,x)Mpq(Kq,t), where ypq's are the unknown coefficients and Mpq(Kp,x) is the matching polynomial of complete graph Kp with p vertices.
The Chebyshev-Lobatto collocation points are used to algebraically expand the matrix system and defined to be(5)xi=a+b2+a−b2cos⁡(πiN)andtj=c+d2+c−d2cos⁡(πjN), where i,j=0,1,…,N, a=x0<x1<…<xN=b and c=t0<t1<…<tN=d.
Graph theory occurs in many real world problems, such as vulnerability, computer, city and neural networks, transportation, algorithms, and mathematical chemistry etc. [2], [3], [9], [13], [23], [28], [29], [31], [33]. It is made up of many graph classes, some of which are complete, cycle, wheel and path graph classes [23], [28]. These are specifically modeled corresponding to the aimed problem. For example, complete graph provides a robust scheme for computer networks, which are in communication with each other. The vulnerability measures have recently been established to evaluate vulnerability aspect of different graph classes. Some of them are neighbor isolated tenacity [9], edge neighbor rupture degree [33], edge scattering number [33] and vertex rupture degree [13]. We can infer from these measures that complete graph Kn with n vertices has a robust structure, which make it different from the other ones. That is, in vulnerability sense, complete graph can not be scattered or ruptured easily. Fig. 1 points out this mentioned robustness of complete graph for only ten vertices. We thus utilize the matching polynomial of complete graph in the matrix-collocation method.Download : Download high-res image (86KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. A complete graph K10.
In 1972, Heilman and Lieb [29] established a polynomial without determining its name for the theory of monomer-dimer systems. In 1979, Farrell [20] used it as the matching polynomial. It is also known that this polynomial has used in different names, such as acyclic [24] and reference [3]. In this study, we make use of terminology and notations found in [23], [28]. The matching polynomial of simple graph Gn with n vertices and m edges is defined to be (see [20], [21], [24], [25], [29], [31])Mn(Gn,t)=∑k=0m(−1)kp(Gn,k)tn−2k, where p(G,0)=1 and p(Gn,k) is computed by collecting k-matching numbers of independent edges in a graph.
Furthermore, the matching polynomial has been differently used in Dewar-type resonance energies [2], monocyclic conjugated system [2], polygraph in polymers [12], chains of cycles [15], chemistry [31] and subdivision graphs [45].
Gutman [24], [25] defined the matching polynomial of complete graph asMn(Kn,t)=∑k=0⌊n/2⌋(−1)k(2k)!2kk!(n2k)tn−2k, and its recurrence relationMn(Kn,t)=tMn(Kn−1,t)−(n−1)Mn(Kn−2,t), which are also called the modified Hermite polynomials (see [24], [25], [44]).
On the other hand, we shall use the fractional Caputo derivative and its initial point e=0 in the matrix relations, which form a basis of the proposed method. This derivative can be given as follows:
Definition 1.1[17] Let u(x,t) be an analytic function on Ω and Γ(α) is Euler gamma function. Then the time fractional Caputo derivative of order α is defined to be∂αeu(x,t)∂etα={1Γ(⌈α⌉−α)∫et(t−s)⌈α⌉−α−1(∂⌈α⌉u(x,s)∂s⌈α⌉)ds,⌈α⌉−1<α<⌈α⌉∂αu(x,t)/∂tα,α∈N,
where t>e and α,t∈R
Similarly, space fractional derivative can be calculated with respect to x in Definition 1.1. One can also refer to [17], [19], [30], [32], [38] for more information about fractional calculus.
