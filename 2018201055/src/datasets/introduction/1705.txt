Although human bone has the ability to heal and regenerate, this ability is ineffective for large sized bone defects or injuries resulting from fracture nonunions, traffic accidents, old age and bone tumor resections [1,2]. These challenging problems in orthopedics pose a substantial threat to the health and quality of life of individuals [3]. Approximately 2.2 million bone transplants are performed each year worldwide, and the annual cost of these surgeries is approximately $2.5 billion [4]. Autografting is considered the "gold standard" for repairing large bone defects [5,6]. However, the high incidence of donor sites and the limited number of available bones for transplantation have substantially affected its application in clinical medicine [7].
In response to the problem of repairing or replacing damaged tissue in patients, tissue engineering was introduced more than three decades ago [8]. This field was promoted with the publication of the renowned article entitled "Tissue Engineering" in Science [9]. As a part of tissue engineering, bone tissue engineering (BTE) is considered the most promising option for repairing large segmental bone defects. Over the past few decades, BTE has developed into a multidisciplinary field that includes biology, medicine, advanced manufacturing and other disciplines. The purpose of BTE is to induce the growth and regeneration of new bone tissue via the collaboration of cells, signals and scaffolds, in which BTE scaffolds have an important role. Strategies for BTE are shown in Fig. 1 [10].Download : Download high-res image (364KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Strategies for bone tissue engineering.

Natural bone is a complex hierarchical structure at the scale of both length and width, as demonstrated in Fig. 2(a). This structure has been illustrated abundantly in the literature [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. The purpose of the designed BTE scaffolds models is to mimic the structure of natural bone. Models with controlled pore structures, porosity and permeability interconnectivity can be designed by computer-aided design (CAD) technology, and can satisfy cell growth and tissue regeneration requirements [22,23]. Fig. 2(b) shows the CAD model of BTE scaffolds with an interconnected porous gradient structure by the Voronoi tessellation method [24]. Obtaining BTE scaffolds from CAD models using traditional manufacturing technology is extremely difficult or impossible.Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2.

Additive manufacturing (AM), which is also known as solid free-form fabrication (SFF) or rapid prototyping (RP), was developed in the late 1980s [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. Three-dimensional printing (3DP) is usually synonymous with AM in nontechnical areas. AM technologies build up complex structures layer by layer from three-dimensional (3D) models. This technology has overcome the difficulty of traditional subtractive manufacturing methodologies to fabricate complex structures [31,32]. AM products and services are predicted to increase to $15.8 billion worldwide [33]. Income forecasts of AM technologies are expected to increase to $23.9 billion by 2022 and $35.6 billion by 2024 [33]. AM technologies, which consist of materials processing, manufacturing methods and mechanical equipment, have been employed in various industries and offer the possibility of customizing specific scaffolds for patients in BTE. With increasing maturity of AM technologies and the urgent need for BTE scaffolds, the application of these technologies in the fabrication of BTE scaffolds has attracted the attention of numerous scientific research institutions and researchers in recent years. Wang et al. designed gradient pore scaffolds with controllable mechanical properties by the Voronoi tessellation method; the scaffolds were manufactured by selective laser melting (SLM) technology using Ti6Al4V powders as the raw materials [34]. Lin et al. fabricated collagen-hydroxyapatite (CHA) BTE scaffolds by low-temperature robocasting and obtained BTE scaffolds with improved cell proliferation and osteogenesis in vitro [35].
However, different biomaterials processed in BTE scaffolds require different AM technologies. The performances of the obtained BTE scaffolds with different biomaterials, structures and additives also vary. Therefore, obtaining the optimal performance of BTE scaffolds fabricated by AM technologies is a research hotspot of BTE.
This paper presents an overview of various AM technologies that are used to manufacture BTE scaffolds. The requirements of an ideal BTE scaffold are described, and then the role of AM technologies for BTE scaffolds is highlighted. Additionally, this paper summarizes the characteristics, materials, accuracy, cost, advantages, disadvantages and morphology of AM technologies and discusses the challenges and opportunities of AM technologies for the fabrication of BTE scaffolds.
