Openness and transparency are critical for all scientific fields (Nosek et al., 2015). To a large extent, efforts to promote open science are driven by a need to reduce questionable research practices (QRPs) (Banks, Rogelberg, Woznyj, Landis, & Rupp, 2016c). Examples of QRPs include HARKing (i.e., hypothesizing after results are known; Kerr, 1998, Murphy and Aguinis, 2019), proposing unnecessarily complex causal models (Saylors & Trafimow, in press), selective reporting of hypotheses (O'Boyle, Banks, & Gonzalez-Mule, 2017), as well as inappropriately reporting degrees of freedom (Cortina, Green, Keeler, & Vandenberg, 2017), fit indices (Williams, O’Boyle, & Yu, 2020), p-values (John, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2012), and insufficient transparency in the general reporting of research results (Aguinis, Ramani, & Alabduljader, 2018; Aguinis & Solarino, 2019). Taken together, these QRPs make research opaque, preclude replicability, and challenge the credibility, trustworthiness, and usefulness of the scientific knowledge that is produced. QRPs are a major concern for open-science efforts because a literature based on false-positive results that will not replicate is not only scientifically misleading, but also worthless for anyone who wants to put knowledge to use (Ioannidis, 2005, Starbuck, 2016).
The existence and detrimental effects of QRPs are no longer novel. Over the past few years, a vast amount of knowledge has been created regarding QRPs that spans disciplines (for reviews see Aguinis et al., 2018, Banks et al., 2019, Banks, O’Boyle et al., 2016, Banks, Rogelberg et al., 2016, Fanelli, 2009, Fanelli, 2012, Nosek et al., 2015, Song et al., 2010). In fact, entire research programs on QRPs are currently carried out in management (Bedeian, Taylor, & Miller, 2010), sociology (Gerber & Malhotra, 2008b), political science (Gerber & Malhotra, 2008a), psychology (John et al., 2012, Simmons et al., 2011), and many other fields (Fanelli, 2010, Fanelli, 2012, Pigott et al., 2013). In sum, there is a substantial amount of knowledge that has been generated about QRPs, their pervasiveness, and their detrimental effects on the credibility and trustworthiness of research. A question that arises then is, why are QRPs still so pervasive, given the abundant literature about these issues? Also, why do stakeholders of research, including authors as well as gatekeepers of scientific knowledge, such as journal editors, reviewers, funding-agency panel members, and board members of professional organizations in charge of journal policies not seem to be taking decisive actions about QRPs?
We use the science-practice gap that is often discussed in applied sciences as an analogy to identify the existence of a science-practice gap in open science, which we offer as an explanation for why the open-science movement is yet to be embraced on a global and massive scale. Importantly, we offer actionable recommendations to narrow this gap. In this process, we draw upon past reviews of the science-practice gap in management and related fields (Aguinis et al., 2017, Banks, Pollack et al., 2016, Bansal et al., 2012, Cascio and Aguinis, 2008, Shapiro et al., 2007).
