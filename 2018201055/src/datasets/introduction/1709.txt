The concept of publishing descriptions of well-known computer programs and holding the programs in a computer program library was proposed by P.G. Burke to North-Holland following his appointment to the Chair of Mathematical Physics at The Queen’s University of Belfast in 1967. Following discussions with W.H. Wimmers, the then Managing Editor at North-Holland, the journal Computer Physics Communications (CPC) and its associated Program Library were established in 1968. The former was published by North-Holland and the latter was established at The Queen’s University of Belfast. Professor P.G. Burke was the Principal Editor of CPC and his wife, Mrs V.M. Burke, managed the Program Library.
In July 1969 sufficient program descriptions had been accepted for publication to fill the first issue of CPC and in September 1970 the first volume was completed. Now, with close to 10,000 articles and 3500 open-source computational physics programs published, CPC is a major resource for the computational physics community worldwide.
To celebrate CPC’s leading role in publishing open-source software in computational physics for over 50 years the editors are delighted to publish this Virtual Special Issue. Since 2018, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the start of the CPC venture, thirty-two invited articles have been published. Each has been peer reviewed and each bears the header ‘CPC 50th anniversary article’. The special issue is in keeping with CPC’s ethos: it is focused on computational physics software and is accompanied by twenty-five software systems. However, its scope is more flexible than for regular issues and this has allowed some experimentation in publishing articles beyond our normal scope. The articles were invited from the following communities.

1.First, five contributions come from authors of computational physics software whose papers are amongst CPC’s most highly cited publications. These include updates on the following packages: PYTHIA [1], HDECAY [2], Loopedia [3], FeynHiggs [4], and ABINIT [5]. It is particularly pleasing to note that the first four packages are closely connected to CERN, an institution that was one of the Program Library’s first subscribers in 1969. The final package, ABINIT [5], was the most highly cited contribution [6] to CPC’s 40th anniversary issue.2.Second, eight contributions come from the UK Collaborative Computational Project [7] (CCP) community. CCPs bring together leading UK expertise in key fields of computational research to tackle large-scale scientific software development, maintenance and distribution. Phil Burke was instrumental in their inception whilst Head of the Theory and Computational Science Division at Daresbury Laboratory (1977–1982) a position he held jointly with his professorship at Queen’s University Belfast. These contributions centre around the following major computer codes. i.MOLSCAT [8], BOUND [9], FIELD [9], Quantics [10], BSHF [11], and UKRmol+ [12] from CCPQ [13] (Quantum Dynamics in Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics).ii.DL_MESO [14] from CCP5 [15] (Simulations of Condensed Phases).iii.Questaal [16] from CCP9 [17] (Electronic Structure of Condensed Matter).iv.SIRF [18] from CCP PET MR [19] (Synergistic PET-MR Image Reconstruction).3.CPC is a partner journal of the interdisciplinary computational science conference Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) [20]. Five extended versions of papers published at PASC 2017 and 2018 have been contributed by this community. i.The first paper, from the area of nuclear reactor neutronics modelling, investigates accelerating the radiation transport mini-application, Minisweep [21], on heterogeneous HPC systems.ii.A second paper, investigates the computational simulation of blood flow, developing a framework [22] for comparing vascular haemodynamics at different points in time.iii.Two papers describe DIAPHANE [23] a portable radiation transport library for astrophysical applications with the second releasing the code as open-source release [24].iv.The final contribution reports on HistogramFreeMUCAA [25] a new multicanonical Monte Carlo algorithm, and associated Python code [26], to obtain the density of states for physical systems with continuous state variables in statistical mechanics.4.The remaining 14 articles that complete the issue have been contributed by authors recommended by CPC’s editors, both specially solicited and regular articles. This eclectic mix involves contributions from fields such as atomic physics, computational fluid dynamics, granular material simulation, ink seepage, many body quantum systems, molecular crystals, partial differential equations and quantum field theory. These papers are as follows. i.GRASP2018 [27], a Fortran 95 version of the General Relativistic Atomic Structure Package; we are delighted to include this article as the lead author, Charlotte Froese Fisher, was one of the original Specialist Editor’s listed in Volume 1, Issue 1, in 1969 [28].ii.A fresh computational approach to atomic structures, processes and cascades which describes the Jena Atomic Calculator [29] which is implemented in Julia.iii.A code implementing a one-dimensional model of an atom exposed to a time-dependent intense, short-pulse EM field [30] providing a tool to train undergraduate physics majors in the art of computation and software development.iv.Optimisations [31] for improving the performance of unstructured finite volume CFD applications on modern multicore and many core processors.v.SPHERA v.9.0.0 [32], a Computational Fluid Dynamics research code, based on the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics mesh-less method.vi.ZEFR [33], a GPU accelerated high-order solver for compressible viscous flows using the flux reconstruction method;vii.SEMTEX [34], a code that enables direct numerical simulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations in cylindrical or Cartesian coordinates.viii.MercuryDPM [35], a code for discrete particle simulations.ix.A paper on the  3D multiscale simulation of ink seepage [36] into paper at the fibre level.x.An open source Matrix Product States [37] code, implemented in Python and Fortran 2003, providing the community with a toolset to analyze the statics and dynamics of one-dimensional quantum systems.xi.Genarris 2.0 [38], a random structure generator for molecular crystals.xii.Nektar++ [39], an open-source framework that provides a flexible, high-performance and scalable platform for the development of solvers for partial differential equations using the high-order spectral/element method;xiii.FEMPAR [40], a scientific software library for the simulation of partial differential equations using finite element methods designed to be scalable on supercomputers and to easily handle multiphysics problems.xiv.Version 3.0 of the Mathematica package DoFun [41] for the derivation of functional equations.
Reproducibility and re-usability of code are important to CPC. Indeed throughout the period 2004–2016 much of the job of the Program Librarian was spent on installing and testing submitted software to ensure that it was portable and that the results claimed by the authors could be replicated. This activity is laborious and time consuming and, as additional Elsevier journals incorporate software into their publications, is not scalable across multiple journals. To explore how reproducibility and re-usability might be managed in the future CPC, along with other Elsevier journals, has been involved in a pilot project with Code Ocean [42] to enable authors to share fully-functional and executable code accompanying their articles. The project’s main purpose is to enable preservation of code, data and the complete environment which is directly linked to the published article.
Code Ocean is a cloud-based reproducibility platform where authors upload code and data and configure the necessary computational environment for reproduction. The code, data, metadata, and computational environment, called a ‘compute capsule’, can then be accessed by reviewers in an anonymous fashion, and upon publication, is provided to readers via a link from the article. Code Ocean supports many open source programming languages, as well as Stata and MATLAB and compute capsules can be created from existing GitHub folders by easy drag and drop.
The authors of seven codes in this special issue have each participated in this pilot and a hyperlink to the corresponding compute capsule can be found in each Program Summary. For convenience the hyperlinks are replicated here: 1d-hydrogen-light-interaction [43], BSHF [44], Questaal [45], UKRmol+ [46], DIAPHANE [47], SEMTEX [48], Nektar++ [49], and SPHERA [50].
Since its inception in 1969 the CPC Program Library [51] has been physically located in, and administered by, Queen’s University Belfast. Since May 2016 all software associated with new Computer Programs in Physics (CPiP) publications have been permanently housed in Elsevier’s Mendeley Data repository [52] which is open source and freely available. Authors benefit from the enhanced discoverability and accessibility of the Mendeley Data platform [52], which is fully indexed and searchable alongside related Elsevier science and technology content. In addition, the long term maintenance of the repository is assured via agreements with the British Library. We are pleased to announce that the transfer of the entire contents of the Program Library was completed at the end of December 2019. This marks the end of an era of association between CPC and Queen’s University Belfast and the key steps along the journey are highlighted in Section 3.
CPC has published close to 10,000 articles since its launch in 1969, including almost 3500 programs. Its benefit to the physics community is evidenced by the 450,000 downloads of programs from the CPC PL website [51] between 1995 and 2016. In the past two years one million full text articles were downloaded from ScienceDirect [53]. Twenty-six papers have been cited 1000+ times, the top one, GROMACS [54], describing a parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment has been cited over 5200 times. Several papers have been downloaded over 25,000 times each. The journal’s impact factor has steadily increased over the years and recently approached 4. CPC has been an undoubted success over the past 50 years and we should like to pay tribute to Phil and Val Burke for their efforts throughout, but particularly in the early years in providing a solid foundation of ideas, infrastructure and organisation upon which the success of CPC has been built. A personal reflection on Phil by Professor Emeritus Alan Hibbert, a lifelong colleague, who joined Queen’s University with Phil in the autumn of 1967, can be found in Section 2.
