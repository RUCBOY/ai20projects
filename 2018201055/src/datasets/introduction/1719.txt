In many cases ad hoc is used in those program which are formed on fly. Formation of these programs takes place in order to fulfill some definite objectives. A special purpose mobile network works in the form of wireless mobile system node which energetically organizes itself inside arbitrary and provisional settings of network. Human beings and automobiles could thus be internet worked inside areas in the absence of previous information about arrangements or when use of this system of system needs wireless network.Fig. 1.Fig. 2.Fig. 3.Fig. 4.Table 1.Table 2.Table 3.Download : Download high-res image (97KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

1.1. Wireless special purpose (Ad-Hoc) networkFrom the last many years lot of work are already done on wireless special purpose Networks. In addition to this network, international mobile information systems program computerized radio program, provide an important contribution in military demands.It is already noticed that from last few years lots of technical and economical requirement support special purpose wireless networks. It happens because availability of practical transmission hardware and laptops or mobile is available in highly compressed form.As safety is one of the most important requirement in other network, it is also required in special purpose Networks. In comparison to network which is established at some point, safety concerns related to cable free special purpose Networks are very complicated it happens because settings inside the cable free network are changed frequently and due to the presence of restrictions in mobile phones. As well as some example of these limitation are battery backup is not good, limited storage memory and bandwidth etc.Routing protocol exists in the form of specialized networking which is a Latin word. It means in support of targeted objective. In most of the cases it is utilized for providing solutions which are formed on the basis of fly. These solutions are formed in order to fulfill a special objective. In networking which is related to computer, special purpose network turns in to a form of connection which is done in the absence of routing device or cable free base station in support of an individual session.Maintenance of a path and information related to this path can be easily done by AODV. Information related to a path is very useful in the route discovery. Each node contains a serial number. For the checking of latest path and transmitted ID these numbers becomes useful. In situations where serial number of demanded route packet is exceeding end node then this path exist in the form of innovative path. In other situations nodes which work in the form of inter mediator give reply to primary node. It has been observed that there have been four types of data packet message that are RREQ, RREP, RERR, and HELLO. RREQ For the transmission of information in the direction of end node, nodes which work in the form of mediated are used. This information is transmitted only when a packet is required to be transmitted. By intermediate node when a packet need to be shifted to destination using source node. Destination node transfers a route reply packet is transmitted in the direction of targeted location by the en node in the form of reply to RREQ. For this purpose it use reverse route. Information like source and targeted location, end serial sequence number are present inside a, RREP packet and destination address. In situations where a route breakdown and RREQ is not able to reach its targeted location then transmission of Route Error Message (RERR) takes place. This information packet contains unreachable destination series number in the company of unreachable targeted location address and source location [6]. Information related to transmission link and for observing the status of connection HELLO becomes necessary. This information is utilized by node in situations where it becomes a part of energetic path.One of the most considerable type of Denial-of-services attack exists in the form of black hole attack In Black Hole attack a malicious are taking benefits of sequence number. Out of the adjacent node, node of attacker collects information related to RREQ. After getting this information it increase value of destination series number. As soon as destination number increased a reply is delivered in the direction of origin node. If value of sequence number is higher it shows latest message on network. Due to this, origin node accepts route reply information out of spiteful node. It does not take reduced destination series number route reply information in to consideration. Spiteful node transferred network traffic. The process of path determination is formed using the information of RREQ because delivery of information packet in the direction of end node becomes necessary for origin node. It has destination sequence number. When adjacent node receives information related to RREQ out of source node S it makes a change inside the routing table. It again transmits information in the direction of adjacent nodes. With the help of RREQ-Id and internet protocol location of Source all RREQ information are detected in a very unique way. They also give favor in the removal of fake copies. Route reply message is produced any intermediate node which contains latest path message to destination. It becomes possible for end node to create similar replyFuzzy logic already exists in the form of method which determines on the basis of level of precision in place of true or false (one or zero). The computers which are used at present time are established on the basis of Boolean concept. In the year of nineteen sixty Dr. Lotfi Zadeh of California University invented the ideology of this logic. In such logic value has found either in the form of one or zero. Such type of logic established overall conclusion of traditional group. In situations where membership operation related to fuzzy groups accept value only in the form of one and zero, indicator operation of traditional group becomes special cases of membership operation. In the concept of fuzzy groupâ€™s tradition bivalent groups becomes famous in the form of crisp groups.Network simulator has been considered as sequence of event network simulators. It consists of ns-1, ns-2, ns-3 and ns-4 that are used in research and teaching. NS2 has been considered as a simulation tool which is running over various platforms. It is capable to provide help in simulation. It is supporting multicast protocols and IP protocols. These protocols may be UDP, TCP, RTP and SRM used in various types of networks. In case of ns2 nodes may be connected simplex as well as duplex.
1.2. Internet of things (IoT)The Internet of Things (IoT) becomes a structure of visible properties and items. Hardware, software, automobile, premises and lots of other material make this structure. All of these things are implanted in the company of computerized hardware, computer programs, sensing elements, network connectivity. Due to this, these materials are able to accurate and transfer data. It becomes possible to sense and manage objects at a certain distance under the existing system structure. It provides opportunity in favor of direct combination of external world in the company of computer based systems. It increases performance, consistency & cost effective advantages. When internet of things is build up in the company of sensing elements, control devices it becomes an example of broad category of computerized geological machine. It contains technical equipment which makes automatic control of home appliances, smart grids, intelligent building, smart transportation and intelligent cities possible. With the help of computing system enclosed by a particular object it is possible to identify each object in a unique way. But for this purpose it is essential that these systems are engaged in the company of Internet infrastructure.
