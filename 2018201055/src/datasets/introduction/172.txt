The rapid emergence of modern information and communication technologies (ICT) has substantially changed the type of skills that are needed to successfully participate, communicate, and work in a modern society. Therefore, in many countries national strategies have been developed to foster digital competences in school and the workplace. Despite this global aim, many studies found substantial interindividual differences in ICT literacy among adolescents (e.g., Christoph et al., 2015; Ihme & Senkbeil, 2017; Siddiq & Scherer, 2019). Particularly, gender differences disadvantaging girls have been repeatedly observed (Goldhammer et al., 2013; Kuhlemeier & Hemker, 2007). Although some research suggested that these differences might have reduced or even reversed in recent years (Eickelmann et al., 2019; Hatlevik & Christophersen, 2013; van Deursen & van Diepen, 2013), it is still unclear how gender differences in ICT literacy develop. Therefore, the present study examined changes in ICT literacy among a period of three years among a representative sample of German 15-year-olds. Moreover, it was hypothesized that individual gender role orientations of the respondents might moderate the emergence of gender differences in ICT, leading to larger gender differences for students emphasizing more traditional gender roles.
