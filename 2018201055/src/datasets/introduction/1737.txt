Research suggests that young children may yield long-term gains from exploring developmentally-appropriate concepts from novel STEM fields, such as computer science and robotics [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. In response to this finding, pedagogy that supports integrated STEM education and inquiry is becoming more pervasive in early childhood settings [6], [7], [8], [9]. Most recently, educational initiatives for interdisciplinary and democratized STEM learning has led to a new domain entering the education stage: [4], [10], [11], [12], [13].
Bioengineering is the deliberate modification of an organism through the alteration of its genes, and among other applications, is used to create vaccines, and develop ecologically sustainable biofuels and plastics [14], [15]. The related field of biodesign is a growing movement at the intersection of biology and design, that uses the creative design process to develop speculative solutions to human problems, such as “probiotic cosmetics, self-healing concrete, cow free-milk, or spider silk that can be woven into clothing” ([16], [17], [18], p. 33). Although it currently viewed as too advanced for early education, some research suggests that young children may already hold preconceptions about genetics and biology, gleaned from popular culture and media aimed at children and young adults [19], [20], [21]. Further, biodesign shares disciplinary practices and concepts with computer science, engineering, and biology, all of which have been successfully introduced in early childhood settings [1], [9], [22], [23]. This suggests that biodesign may be an effective way to introduce young children to core concepts of biology and bioethics through the lens of engineering design and creative problem solving. Currently, there is little research on tools or resources to support young children’s curiosity and learning in this novel domain, although research with older learners is steadily growing [4], [13], [24]. Additionally, tangible technologies have been shown to support children’s engagement with foundational ideas relevant to biodesign, including instruction-based coding languages and the design process [1], [25], [26], [27].
CRISPEE is a tool developed by the DevTech Research Group at Tufts University and the Human Computer Interaction Lab at Wellesley College, and was designed to engage young children ages 5–8 years in explorations of foundational biodesign. By iteratively designing CRISPEE to align with design frameworks for developmentally appropriate learning tools (e.g. Positive Technological Development; [28]), the authors sought to create a tangible tool for children to “touch and hold” tangible representations of genes, a necessarily abstract and microscopic topic that was previously unavailable to children through traditional curricular methods. The purpose of introducing these concepts in early childhood is not to prepare a bio-tech literate workforce, or unnecessarily increase the pace of the K-12 STEM curriculum, but rather to allow children a developmentally appropriate medium to explore topics at the intersection of science and society that they may already come into contact with in their daily lives, such as bioethics and cross-cutting scientific advances.
The purpose of this study was two-fold. First, we wanted to explore children’s experience of the physical interaction of our tangible CRISPEE technology. This would inform the ongoing design research of the prototype, allowing us to leverage children’s interactions to make the learning metaphors used in CRISPEE more relatable. Second, we wanted to explore what, if any, preconceptions children held about the topic of “genes” before any kind of CRISPEE intervention, in order to identify any popular preconceptions that young children might hold.
To explore these questions, we collaborated with the Boston Children’s Museum to host a pop-up style exhibit featuring the CRISPEE technology. During each play session, children answered an open-ended question about genes to surface their relevant preconceptions. Then, children spent 10 to 20 min free-playing with the CRISPEE tool, working one-on-one or in groups of two with a researcher to document and prompt their explorations. While children played, parents and guardians were invited to complete a voluntary survey to gather information about the children’s home and school experiences with science, engineering, technology, ethics, and design. Because only 44 families completed the survey (70% of the sample), aggregate responses will be shared here to contextualize the sample, but will not be reported on in results.
