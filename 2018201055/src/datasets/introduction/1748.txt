Complex fluid-interface dynamics [1], [2], [3], [4], disordered liquid-liquid emulsions [5], [6], soft-flowing microfluidic crystals [7], [8], [9], [10], all stand as complex states of matter which, besides raising new challenges to modern non-equilibrium thermodynamics, pave the way to many engineering applications, such as combustion and food processing [11], [12], as well as to questions in fundamental biological and physiological processes, like blood flows and protein dynamics [13].
In particular this novel state of soft matter opens up exciting prospects for the design of new materials whose effective building blocks are droplets instead of molecules [14], [7], [15], [16].
The design of new materials has traditionally provided a relentless stimulus to the development of computational schemes spanning the full spectrum of scales, from electrons to atoms and molecules, to supramolecular structures all the way up to the continuum, encompassing over ten decades in space (say from Angstroms to meters) and at least fifteen in time (from femtoseconds to seconds, just to fix ideas). Of course, no single computational model can handle such huge spectrum of scales, each region being treated by dedicated and suitable methods, such as electronic structure simulations, ab-initio molecular dynamics, classical molecular dynamics, stochastic methods, lattice kinetic theory, finite difference and finite elements for continuum fields. Each of these methods keeps expanding its range of applicability, to the point of generating overlap regions which enable the development of powerful multiscale procedures [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].
In this paper we focus on a very specific window of material science, meso-materials, namely materials whose “effective” constitutive bricks are neither atoms nor molecules, but droplets instead.
Obviously, droplets cannot serve as “super-molecules” in a literal sense, since they generally lack chemical specificity. Yet, in recent years, droplets have revealed unsuspected capabilities of serving as building blocks (motifs) for the assembly of new types of soft materials, such as dense foams, soft glasses, microfluidic crystals and many others [14], [7], [15], [16].
Droplets offer a variety of potential advantages over molecules, primarily the possibility of feeding large-scale productions of soft materials, such as scaffolds for tissue engineering and other biomedical applications [1], [2], [24].
From a computational standpoint, mesoscale materials offer the opportunity to deploy mesoscale models with reduced needs of down-coupling to molecular dynamics and even less for to upward coupling to continuum methods. Mesoscale particle methods [25], [26] and especially lattice Boltzmann methods [27], [28], [29] stand out as major techniques in point. In this paper we focus precisely on the recent extensions of the latter which are providing a versatile tool for the computational study of such droplet-based mesoscale materials.
The main issue of this class of problems is that they span six or more orders of magnitude in space (nm to mm) and nearly twice as many in time, thus making the direct simulation of their dynamics unviable even on most powerful present-day supercomputers. Why six orders? Simply because the properties of such materials are to a large extent controlled by nanoscale interactions between near-contact fluid-fluid interfaces, which affect the behavior of the entire device, typically extending over millimeter-centimeters scales. Why twice as many in time? Typically, because the above processes are driven by capillary forces, resulting in very slow motion and long equilibration times, close to the diffusive scaling tdif ∼ L2, tdif being the diffusive equilibration time of a device of size L.
Notwithstanding such huge computational demand, a clever combination of large-scale computational resources and advanced multiscale modeling techniques may provide decisive advances in the understanding of the aforementioned complex phenomena and on the ensuing computational design of new mesoscale materials. Many multiscale techniques have emerged in the past two decades, based on static or moving grid methods, as well as various forms of particle dynamics, both at the atomistic and mesoscale levels [30], [31], [32].
In this paper, we shall be concerned mostly with a class of mathematical models known as lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods, namely a lattice formulation of a Boltzmann's kinetic equation, which has found widespread use across a broad range of problems involving complex states of flowing matter at all scales, from macroscopic fluid turbulence, to micro and nanofluidics [27].
Among others, one of the main perks of the LB method is its excellent amenability to massively parallel implementations, including forthcoming exascale platforms. From the computational point of view an exascale system (the supercomputer class foreseen in 2022) will be able to deliver a peak performance of more than one billion of billions floating-point operations per second (1018), an impressive figure that, once properly exploited, can benefit immensely soft matter simulations.
As a matter of fact, attaining exaflop performance on these applications is an open challenge, as it requires a synergic integration of many different skills and a performance-oriented match between system architecture and the algorithmic formulation of the mathematical model.
In this paper we provide a description of the different key points that need to be addressed to achieve exascale performance in lattice Boltzmann simulations of soft mesoscale materials.
The article is organized as follows.
In Section 2, for the sake of self-consistency, we provide a brief introduction to the main features of the LB method.
In Section 3 a qualitative description of the up-to-date performance of pre-exascale computers is discussed, together with an eye at LB performances on such pre-exascale (petascale) computers for macroscopic hydrodynamics.
In Section 4 a concrete LB application to microfluidic problems is presented. In Section 5 a new high-performance lattice Boltzmann code for colloidal flows is presented.
Finally, in Section 6 partial conclusions are drawn together with an outlook of future developments
