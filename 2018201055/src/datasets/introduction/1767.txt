Hazy image often shows low contrast and poor visibility since the light reflected from scene objects is attenuated in the air and further blended with the atmospheric light scattered by some particles before it reaches the camera. Image dehazing has received a lot of attention in recent years due to its wide application in media systems. All the systems assume the inputs are clean, so removing haze from input will boost the performance of media systems.
However, single image dehazing is massively ill-posed since the degradation depends on the unknown depth which varies at different positions. To solve this problem, many prior methods provide a solution by including more information such as multiple images of the same scene or depth information [1], [2], [3], [4].
Single image dehazing has made dramatically progress in past decades. We broadly divide these methods into two groups: prior-based methods and learning-based method. Prior-based methods solve the problem by utilizing visual cues or statistical properties of haze-free images [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. He et al. [14] propose a dark channel prior based on the static of haze-free images that most local outdoor clear image patches contain some pixels whose intensity is very low in at least one color channel. Meng et al. [10] improve the dark channel prior using a more general case-boundary constraint. In [15], Fattal propose a novel method based on the prior that pixels in a local patch of haze-free images form a line in RGB color space. Berman et al. [12] propose a haze-line prior based on the fact that a clear image can be represented by a few hundred distinct colors. Some methods are designed for special cases [16]. All the aforementioned methods can generate a high quality image when the prior holds. However, these methods cannot generate a plausible result when the prior breaks.
Recently, learning-based methods have achieved high performance by using machine learning, convolutional neural networks and large-scale synthetic training datasets [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. In [22], Tang et al. seek a best combination of local maximum contrast, dark channel prior, hue disparity and local maximum saturation using forest regression to estimate transmission map. A multi-scale fusion scheme [23] for single image dehazing is proposed. Zhu et al. [11] propose a linear model to create the relation between the scene depth of the hazy image under color attenuation prior and solve the model with a supervised manner. Convolutional neural networks [24], [25] also have been applied in single image dehazing. In [5], Cai et al. propose a novel CNN-based method to estimate the relation between the hazy image and transmission map. Ren et al. [26] propose a multi-scale CNN to solve the problem of transmission map estimating. Inspired by recently End-to-End deep learning approaches for image restoration and enhancement [27], [28], [29], four fully End-to-End methods [6], [7], [25], [30] are proposed. In [6], Li et al. propose an End-to-End method for single image dehazing via introducing a new variable. Ren et al. [7] introduce a network fusing the three preprocessed images to generate the final haze-free image. Zhang et al. [30] propose a network which can jointly optimize transmission map, atmospheric light and also image dehazing. Although these methods have achieved End-to-End dehazing, we find that they can’t deal heavy hazy image well as shown in Fig. 1.Download : Download high-res image (181KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Visual comparison on real-world dense hazy image. The result of Cai et al.’s method [5] exists color distortion. The results generated by Li et al. [6] and Ren et al. [7] still have most residual haze. In contrast, our algorithm performs well in dense hazy situation, the result looks more pleasant.
To address above limitations, we propose a novel Fully Convolutional Dehazing Networks to exploit global context information in single image haze removal. We first use point-wise convolutions to extract non-local features, we call this part of network as independent extractor and the output as non-local features. Second, we exploit the relation in non-local features using dilated convolution. Finally, we reconstruct the haze-free image from the fusion features. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
•We present a novel fully convolutional neural network for single image dehazing, refer to as NLDN, which optimizes the end-to-end pipeline from hazy images to clean ones without pre- and post- processing or intermediate variables estimation step.•We use point-wise convolution to extract an intermediate representation from hazy image, which can reduce the input variation of model and make the process of train easy to converge.•In order to further improve the discriminative of non-local feature, we propose a Non-local loss, which reduces the intra-color variations.•We conduct extensive experiments to quantitatively and qualitatively compare our method with the state-of-the-art single image dehazing algorithms and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
