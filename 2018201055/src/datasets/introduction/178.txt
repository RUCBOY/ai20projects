In the medical field, security is an essential part of securing patients’ data from third parties who could modify or delete a ‘patient’s record. To prevent this, proper methods are used to secure medical data [1]. If the data are transferred to a network, significant issues can arise, such as data loss, data delay, and attacks that lead to insecurity [2]. This must be avoided in the initial stage to achieve the original data transmission. By protecting data security, the health researchers access the data collection and storage and give the users the necessary treatment [3]. Medical data includes the “patient’s health care and treatments followed, and unauthorized user hacks can severely affect. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is used to secure patients’ health records [4]. According to this policy, the patients’ sensitive data is stored and cannot be accessed without the patient; medical data is also stored and exchanged in a secure manner [5].
The forensics medical data includes collecting healthcare records of patients and covers biological material obtained from patients [6]. The collected records are used for further investigation during medical forensic evaluations. The clinicians perform medical data diagnostic of the ”s health and reports with biological samples for further validation [7]. The forensics data includes medicine given to the patients and treatment followed by the history of patients by consulting the doctor [8]. Medical data forensics should be very secure from illegal access. Several types of algorithms such as ciphertext policies, encryption methods, and access control mechanisms, have been developed [9]. The necessary features of the body are observed, considered, and stored for accurate retrieval. The data must be secure, and only the forensics department can access the biological data samples collected [6], [10]. Medical data forensics uses the digital biological sample upgrades that lead to easy verification of the healthcare records. It is denoted as the electronic health record for accurate healthcare data monitoring [8], [10]. The electronic health record consists of several information, including patient health conditions, medical reports, drug information, and more.
The forensic health record of the patients is stored and evaluated with better retrieval without any loss. To achieve medical data forensics with better accuracy, machine learning is used [11]. By using machine learning algorithms, the data are trained and upgraded to result efficiently. There are various machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machine, neural networks, decision tree, and random forest, to improve forensic medical data [12]. It is done by evaluating the predefined knowledge by training the pursuing data [7], [11]. Thus, machine learning uses digital investigation [13], [14] for the forensic department to obtain the required crime scene. Using machine learning techniques involves achieving personalized and predictive medicine at data acquisition [15], [16]. It is also used to attain results quickly and efficiently at the time of investigation with the biological samples [17]. The proposed method addresses the security challenges in forensic medical data by introducing prediction-based data analysis [18], [19]. Transfer learning is used to obtain better accuracy in medical data forensics. This is observed in the smart meters that secure the data from unauthorized users in the smart grid. The current study’s main contributions are: (1) We increase the medical data security by applying a PDA approach. During this process, the system uses a user validating, matching, and prediction process that improves the overall data security. (2) We maximize the accuracy of medical data forensics analysis using a significant transfer-learning function. (3) Finally, we reduce data processing time while analyzing medical data. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses the various researchers’ work regarding secure medical data processing; Section 3 analyzes the predictive data analysis process to examine the medical data, Section 4 evaluates the excellence of the system, and Section 5 provides a conclusion.
