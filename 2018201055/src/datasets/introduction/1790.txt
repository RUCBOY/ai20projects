Bibliometric studies provide quantitative measures to assess the state of science. They are needed to answer quite practical questions, for example, what size telescopes — large or small — provide the most important results? Bibliometric research by Helmut Abt (2005) gave an unexpected answer to this question and also to the question of the most productive age of outstanding astronomers. It is difficult to say something new after the numerous bibliometric works by Abt. However, for his calculations Abt used data from several of the most well-known high-impact journals such as Astrophysical Journal (ApJ) and Astronomy & Astrophysics that publish papers on almost all topics in astronomy. Meteor science1 is a rather small field of astronomy— the number of International Astronomical Union Commission F1 (IAU C.F1) members is currently 162. To obtain acceptable statistics on publications, we should use at least all refereed sources. In addition, bibliometric distributions in this narrow field can be different from those for all astronomy. Meteor science has three main sub-fields, which may be labelled by keywords ‘meteors, meteoroids’, ‘meteorites’ and ‘interplanetary dust’. In this study, I analysed the refereed publications of the last 19 years (2000–2018) related mostly to meteors and meteoroids, but not to meteorites or interplanetary dust (the details of the sample will be given in Section 2). The main question I planned to answer was: what is the mean number of publications per year per one researcher? All other results described below were obtained as collateral on the way to this main one.
