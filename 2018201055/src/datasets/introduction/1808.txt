There has been a massive accumulation of human-centric data to an unprecedented scale over the last two decades. This data explosion coupled with rapid growth in computing power has rejuvenated the field of neural networks and sophisticated intelligent systems (IS). In the past, neural networks have mostly been limited to the application of industrial control and robotics. However, recent advancements in neural networks have led to successful applications of IS in almost every aspect of human life with the introduction of intelligent transportation [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], intelligent diagnosis and health monitoring for precision medicine [11], [12], [13], [14], robotics and automation in home appliances [15], virtual online assistance [16], e-marketing [17], and weather forecasting and natural disasters monitoring [18] among others. The widespread success of IS technology has redefined and augmented human ability to communicate and comprehend the world by innovating ‘smart’ physical systems. A ‘smart’ physical system is designed to interpret, act, and collaborate with complex multimodal human senses such as vision, touch, speech, smell, gestures, or hearing. A large body of smart physical systems have been developed targeting two primary senses used in human communication: speech and vision.
The advancement in speech and vision processing systems has enabled tremendous research and development in the areas of human–computer interactions [19], biometric applications [20], [21], security and surveillance [22], and most recently in computational behavioral analysis [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. While traditional machine learning and evolutionary computations have enriched IS to solve complex pattern recognition problems over many decades, these techniques have limitations in their ability to process natural data or images in raw data formats. A number of computational steps are used to extract representative features from raw data or images prior to applying machine learning models. This intermediate representation of raw data, known as ‘hand-engineered’ features, requires domain expertise and human interpretation of physical patterns such as texture, shape, geometry, etc. There are three major problems with ‘hand-engineered’ features that impede major progress in IS. First, the choice of ‘hand-engineered’ features is application dependent and involves human interpretation and evaluation. Second, ‘hand-engineered’ features are extracted from each sample in a standalone manner without the knowledge of inevitable noise and variations in data. Third, ‘hand-engineered’ features may perform excellently with some inputs but may completely fail to extract quality features in other types of input data. This can lead to high variability in speech and vision recognition performance.
A solution to the limitations of ‘hand-engineered’ features has emerged through mimicking functions of biological neurons in artificial neural networks (ANN). The potential of ANNs is recently exploited with access to large trainable datasets, efficient learning algorithms, and powerful computational resources. Advancements of ANN over the last decade have led to deep learning [28], [29] that has revolutionized several application domains, including computer vision, speech analysis, biomedical image processing, and online market analyses. The rapid success of deep learning over traditional machine learning may be attributed to three factors. First, deep learning offers end-to-end trainable architectures that integrate feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and final classification. These steps are otherwise treated as standalone sub-systems in conventional machine learning, which may result in suboptimal pattern recognition performance. Second, target-specific and informative features may be learned from both input examples and classification targets without resorting to application-specific feature extractors. Third, deep learning models are highly flexible in capturing complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and output targets at a level that is far beyond the capacity of ‘hand-engineered’ features.
The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses deep learning architectures that have been recently introduced to solve contemporary challenges in speech and vision domain. Section 3 provides a comprehensive discussion of real-world and commercial application cases for the technology. Section 4 discusses state-of-the-art results in implementing these sophisticated algorithms in resource-constrained hardware environments. This section also highlights prospects of ‘smart’ applications in mobile devices. Section 5 discusses several successful and emerging applications of neural networks in state-of-the-art IS. Section 6 elaborates potential developments and challenges in the future for IS. Finally, Section 7 concludes with a summary of the key observations in this article.
