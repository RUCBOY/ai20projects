The model cyanobacteria, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (PCC 6803) is a promising host for the direct biochemical production from CO2 (Angermayr et al., 2015; Hirokawa et al., 2017; Lai and Lan, 2015; Mohammadi et al., 2016; Oliver et al., 2016; Shirai et al., 2016). Further understanding of the mechanism of metabolic regulation in PCC 6803 is required to guide metabolic engineering research for more efficient production of target compounds (Matsuda et al., 2017). The metabolic regulatory mechanism of photoautotrophic PCC 6803 is unique and distinct from that of heterotrophic bacteria like Escherichia coli. Several mechanisms have been reported to play key regulatory roles in PCC 6803. These include a carbon fixation reaction (RuBisCo) as the ultimate rate-limiting step in photosynthetic carbon fixation (Kanno et al., 2017; Raines, 2011; Stitt and Schulze, 1994), a transcriptional global regulation under nitrogen starvation conditions by SigE (Osanai et al., 2005, 2013), a post-translational regulation by CP12 as a response to the redox state (Tamoi et al., 2005; Wedel and Soll, 1998), and allosteric regulation by pyruvate kinase (Pyk) (Knowles et al., 2001). However, our current knowledge on allosteric regulation is still limited, which has become a bottleneck in metabolic engineering studies (Nishiguchi et al., 2019).
Allosteric regulation has been identified and investigated by genetic analysis of over-producing mutants as well as biochemical characterization of metabolic enzymes (Knowles et al., 2001; Takeya et al., 2017, 2018). Furthermore, a more systematic search method consisting of a computer simulation of allosteric regulation using an ensemble of kinetic metabolic models has been recently suggested (Christodoulou et al., 2018). Ensemble modeling of microbial metabolism has been applied to build accurate predictive models by synthesizing the results of multiple models into a single score (Contador et al., 2009; Dash et al., 2017; Khodayari et al., 2014a, 2014b; Khodayari and Maranas, 2016; Rizk and Liao, 2009; Tran et al., 2008). Recent computational simulation of E. coli metabolism identified NADPH feedback inhibition on G6PDH, since inhibition has a large contribution to predictability and stability of the kinetic metabolic model of E. coli (Christodoulou et al., 2018).
This study aimed to use the ensemble modeling approach to investigate allosteric regulation in the PCC 6803 metabolism. The data driven-computer simulation using metabolic flux, enzyme abundance, and metabolite concentration data successfully identified candidates for allosteric inhibition. The enzyme assay experiment using the recombinant protein confirmed that isocitrate was a non-competitive inhibitor of phosphoribulokinase (Prk) as a novel allosteric regulation of cyanobacteria metabolism.
