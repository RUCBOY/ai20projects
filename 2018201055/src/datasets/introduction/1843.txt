Due to the object scale, pose, viewpoint, and part deformation, accommodating these geometric variations is still challenging in sophisticated computer vision tasks [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Different from the manner of depending on large data with sufficient variations or that of using transformation-invariant features and algorithms [1], [7], [8], Deformable ConvNet (DCNv1) [9] was proposed to learn a 2D spatial offset to let the grid sampling locations swim with respect to the proceeding feature maps. However, since the adaptive learning of the filter deformation is limited, DCNv1 still suffers from the problem of the irrelevant image content. Then, Zhu et al. [10] revised it and proposed Deformable ConvNet v2 (DCNv2). They made a reformulation of deformable convolution that includes channel-wise attention named modulation mechanism, and then they stacked more such deformable convolutions into networks to intensify the control of sampling over a broader range of feature levels [8]. The sampling locations finally surround the distinct object content and the channel weights are activated by modulated mechanism to judge the impact of sampling point. Ideally, if the sampling points locate in irrelevant content, the channel weight would be punished by multiplying a small factor to alleviate its influence. Therefore, both the spatial and channel attention should share the same function to be object-sensitive. However, due to proceeding the same input feature map by separate convolutions without spatial-channel interaction, these two attention modules may be unknown to each other and hard to adapt synchronously. This limitation makes the modulation mechanism a simple learnable feature amplitude that doesn’t powerfully constraint the channel weight exactly, so that the spatial attention weights do not correlate well with feature importance measures. Besides, DCNv2 replaces 13 standard convolutions with deformable convolutions in ResNet101 [11]. This choice is suboptimal to enhance the adaptive geometric modeling ability.
Deformable convolution still has potentials to be excavated. In this paper, inspired by the observation that spatial offset and modulated offset share an internal relationship [12], [13], we mainly from two aspects, deformable modules and deformable organization, to refine the deformable convolutional network, which is named Adaptive Deformable ConvNet (A-DCN).
For the deformable modules, we propose to leverage an inter-module information to connect spatial and channel attention modules. We first reformulate the deformable convolution and deformable RoIpooling by correlating spatial attention with channel attention. As shown in Fig. 1, in spatial attention, an adaptive dilation factor is introduced to initialize the sample locations and to decompose the displacement of them, aiming to strengthen the process of offset learning. Second, the adaptive dilation could be multiplied in modulated mechanism. Thus, the spatial and channel attention could be interpolated. We use this information as a constraint added into the channel-wise attention (modulation mechanism) to correlate it with the tendency or choice of spatial attention. Considering the refinement and interdependency of both spatial and channel attention, the geometric transformation ability in manipulating spatial support regions is further improved.Download : Download high-res image (244KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Scheme of adaptive deformable convolution. K is the kernel size of it (e.g., 3×3).
From the aspect of deformable organizations, both DCNv1 and DCNv2 term deformable convolution as a powerful counterpart of regular convolution. They replace the plain counterpart in ResNet [11] with deformable convolutions. However, the factors of influencing enhanced geometric modeling ability are not comprehensively exploited in these works. In this paper, we develop deformable convolution into feature aggregation module as an independent congregation based on high-level feature maps. And then we can make an empirical study of much more general and various settings of three kinds of deformable convolutions (i.e., standard, modulated, and our adaptive deformable convolutions). The study yields some significant findings for the property of deformable convolutions.
Existing applications [12], [9], [10] on object detection are much more than that on semantic segmentation. And some of their findings on these two tasks are different. Therefore, we make a thorough analysis to delve the performance of deformable convolutions on semantic segmentation. Besides, we propose a method named Adaptive Deformable ConvNet (A-DCN) for semantic segmentation [14], [15] which achieves state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 [16] and Cityscapes [17]. To further assess the generalization of deformable convolution, our A-DCN is also evaluated on object detection benchmark, achieving outstanding gains over the original model on COCO [18].
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
(1) We reformulate the deformable module to strengthen the adaptive transformation ability. The refinement in spatial, channel attention, and spatial-channel interdependency allows the deformation to be more powerful with minimal cost.(2) An empirical study is conducted on the deformation organization, which concludes the factors of cooperation within deformable convolutions. These experiments will give some hints for the further works using deformable convolution.(3) More ablation study is implemented on semantic segmentation to analyze the capability and property of previous and our proposed deformable convolutions. These experiments provide extensive understanding of dense prediction.(4) We propose Adaptive Deformable ConvNet (A-DCN) which could be incorporate into state-of-the-art CNNs [14], [15], [19], [20] of computer vision. And our methods also achieve more superior performance than original architecture on two benchmarks of semantic segmentation (PASCAL VOC 2012 [16] and Cityscapes [17]) and one benchmark of object detection (COCO [18]).
