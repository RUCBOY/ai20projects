Science fiction has been described by the author Brian Aldiss as a form of ‘cultural wallpaper’ (Aldiss & Wingrove, 1986), and is increasingly employed in research, education, science advocacy, and communication as an easily recognised public product (Menadue & Cheer, 2017). The genre appears to have a special relevance for the public as a source of thought experiments and speculation about the way in which people think about the human capacity to bring about change through the use of tools and technology (Menadue, Giselsson, & Guez, 2019). In this regard, it may be regarded as a potent indicator of contemporary popular interests, and mapping of science fiction texts against historical changes in society and culture supports this approach (Menadue, 2017, Menadue, 2018a, Menadue, 2018b, Menadue, 2019a). It is a genre that has an increasingly broad popularity and influence, with a consumer demographic today that is highly educated, takes an interest in real-world science, and which has come to reflect a less specialised audience than might have been the case in the early 20th Century (Berger, 1977; Menadue & Jacups, 2018).
Science fiction is well known for significantly dystopian content, and the employment of dystopian scenarios across a wide range of cultural topics including gender, race, and health (Barrish, 2016; Bethlehem, 2014; Dziubinskyj, 2007; Gilarek, 2012; McFadden, 2015; Milerius, 2011; Milner, 2009; Penteado, 2015; Raphals, 2013; Rhines, 2003). As a literature of thought experiments that investigate dystopian scenarios and the implications of human impacts on our world, and our technological interactions with it, it might be expected that science fiction would feature diseases, plagues, epidemics, and pandemics, and the viral vectors of these. As a reflection of cultural interests, the frequency and prominence of these topics would focus on contemporary events and public concerns. The first notable historic work of science fiction that discusses pandemics and their potential to radically impact on human society is perhaps Mary Shelley’s The Last Man, first published in 1826 (Shelley, 2015). The novel describes a far future (to Shelley) pandemic which eradicates all human life towards the end of the 21st Century and includes contemporary scientific discussion of vaccination, as well as sociological factors such as the conflict between religious and scientific representations of cause, effect, and cure.
Using digital tools to analyse text is a relatively modern approach to content analysis, although it draws upon earlier methods of exigesis and bibliographic study (Menadue, 2019b, Menadue, 2020). Increasing technological sophistication and computing power has led to the development of sophisticated methods and approaches to text analysis in the digital humanities (Bainbridge, 2004; Berry, 2012; Berry & Kogan, 2010; Clement, 2013; Flanders, 2013, p. 10; Halliday & Webster, 2005; Hammond et al., 2013; Hoover, 2013). As a sub-set of techniques, text mining has become a commonplace method for gathering data for analysis in biomedical and technological research, computing and social media, and the social and political sciences more generally (Abbe, Grouin, Zweigenbaum, & Falissard, 2016; Altman et al., 2008; Fogelman-Soulié, 2008; Irfan et al., 2015; Kaal et al., 2014; Obradović et al., 2013; Raychaudhuri, Chang, Imam, & Altman, 2003; Rodriguez-Esteban, 2009; Rodriguez-Esteban & Bundschus, 2016; Schummer, 2005; Thomas et al., 2011; Thompson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Zweigenbaum, Demner-Fushman, Yu, & Cohen, 2007).
An especially important resource for comparative corpus studies has emerged from the Google Books project, which has involved the digitisation of millions of books and the classification and tagging of the digitised text by parts of speech and grammatical use. Google Ngram data harvested from this long-running work on digitising literary corpora in several languages is freely available online (Michel et al., 2011). For this study, the Google corpus has been employed to provide benchmarking of proportionate frequency. It indicates the fluctuation of frequencies for specific terms over a time series for comparison with changes occurring in the selected science fiction corpus. Frequency graphs offer opportunities to identify correlation with real-world events that may have influenced the frequency of these topics arising in the literature. When examining the prevalence and degree of focus – gauged by word frequency – on dystopian topics relating to disease, infection, and death, it seems reasonable to label this feature of science fiction as an example of ‘cultural pathology.’ We find insights into the diffusion and emergence of popular interests that grow in currency among a specific cultural group, spread, and become endemic, or are perhaps even eradicated over time. Evidence of correlations between representations in science fiction of these topics and real-world historical trends may support the conjecture that science fiction focuses a lens on contemporary human concerns and interests.
