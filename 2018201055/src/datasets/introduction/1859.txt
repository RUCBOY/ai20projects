A big problem in a computer-based systems (CBSs)1 development organization is how to improve the immigration (also called “onboarding”) of a new hire to the organization or a mover within the organization into a CBS development project of the organization that is already in progress and whose existing members have extensive awareness of the domain of the system under development. These new hires and movers are collectively called “newbies” in the current paper2.
A person who has sufficient domain knowledge to do her role is said to be domain aware or to have domain awareness, and A person who lacks sufficient domain knowledge to do her role is said to be domain ignorant or to have domain ignorance. Domain awareness and domain ignorance are considered specific kinds of domain familiarities. The focus of the current paper is on domain ignorance and the software-development activities a domain ignorant can and cannot do.
A newbie, under this definition, joining a project that is already in progress, usually initially has less detailed knowledge about the project and its domain than the existing, veteran members of the project. The newbie's actual detailed initial knowledge about the project and its domain, in general, lies anywhere in the full spectrum from ignorance to veteran-level awareness. However, in practice, if a nominal newbie arrives to the project on the awareness side of the spectrum, the project's veterans will notice very quickly that she3 is able to contribute as much as any veteran, and she would no longer be considered a newbie4. Therefore, we assumed5 that: 
AENIIDI: Every newbie is initially ignorant of the domain of the project that she joins.
