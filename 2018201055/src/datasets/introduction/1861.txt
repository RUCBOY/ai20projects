Problem-based learning (PBL) is a learner-centered constructivist instructional method, which embeds student learning processes in solving real-life problems (Barrows & Tamblyn, 1980; Hmelo-Silver, 2004; Savery, 2015). Previous studies suggested PBL can facilitate long-term retention, skill development, and increase student and teacher satisfaction (Chowdhry, 2016; Oliveira, dos Santos, & Garcia, 2013; Strobel & Van Barneveld (2009)). Meanwhile, with advances in gaming and computing technology, researchers argued that Serious Games (SG) created for non-entertainment purposes (Abt, 1970, p. 9), can help student learning in educational settings (Boyle et al., 2016; Connolly, Boyle, Hainey, McArthur, & Boyle, 2012; Prensky, 2001). By adopting PBL pedagogy in SG environments, instructional designers and researchers hope to increase learner motivation, enhance learning experiences, improve learning performances and help learners develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills (Hou & Li, 2014; Lee & Chen, 2009; SÃ¡nchez & Olivares, 2011).
From a constructivist perspective, learner characteristics are important for understanding individual learning. Metacognition is an important learner characteristic, because it involves the process of thinking about thinking (Flavell, 1979), including knowing about one's own learning and memory capabilities, knowing what learning strategies are useful, and planning and monitoring the learning process. Researchers suggested that metacognition is necessary for students to succeed in PBL (Davidson & Sternberg, 1998; Marra, Jonassen, Palmer, & Luft, 2014; Shin, Jonassen, & McGee, 2003). Without adequate metacognition, learners may have difficulty understanding complex topics in learning environments (e.g., SG), as they may fail to plan, set goals, use effective strategies, and monitor and reflect learning processes during learning (Azevedo, Cromley, & Seibert, 2004; Mayer, Griffith, Jurkowitz, & Rothman, 2008). Goal orientation is another important learner characteristic. Previous studies have shown that student goal orientations critically influences their behavior in SG environments (Hsieh, Cho, Liu, & Schallert, 2008; Liu, 2005; Liu, Kang, Lee, Winzeler, & Liu, 2015). Literature also suggested that goal orientation plays an important role at the earliest stage of learner metacognitive regulation, which can guide the entire metacognitive regulatory processes (Moshman, 2017; Schraw & Dennison, 1994; Zimmerman, 2002, 2013).
Although many important studies in the past four decades have revealed learner metacognition affect learning (e.g., Flavell, 1979, 1987; Mihalca, Mengelkamp, & Schnotz, 2017; Schraw & Dennison, 1994; Shin, Jonassen, & McGee, 2003), few studies have described learning process differences based on learner metacognitive differences. Goal orientation has also been studied extensively for the past four decades (Locke & Latham, 2002; Middleton & Midgley, 1997; Ryan, 1970; Won, Wolters, & Mueller, 2017) and important advances have been made; however, the relationship between goal orientation and problem-solving processes in SG environments is still unclear. In addition, although Gul and Shehzad (2012) have suggested metacognition and goal orientation together could result in learner academic success, i.e., high GPA, there are few studies that have analyzed the impact of the interaction between metacognition and goal orientation on learner problem-solving performances and processes.
Therefore, to better understand learner during problem-solving, more research is needed on how metacognition and goal orientation would affect learner problem-solving in SG environments, including both problem-solving performances and processes. This study aims to answer this question by studying college students in a SG environment that adopts the PBL pedagogy to teach space science.
