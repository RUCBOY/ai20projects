Gamification approaches are being applied with increasing frequency in an attempt to positively affect behavior and cognitive processes by enhancing the system or service with motivational affordances and eventually by bringing similar experiences as games do (Huotari and Hamari, 2017). Motivational affordances have been widely used in many fields such as business (Alcivar, Abad, 2016, Xi, Hamari, 2020), crowdsourcing (Morschheuser et al., 2017), healthcare (Johnson et al., 2016) and education (Dichev, Dicheva, 2017, Hanus, Fox, 2015, Koivisto, Hamari, 2019, Majuri, Koivisto, Hamari, 2018, Osatuyi, Osatuyi, de la Rosa, 2018, Seaborn, Fels, 2015). Additionally, gamification has been employed in many education related contexts, across different educational levels (Caponetto, Earp, Ott, 2014, Dicheva, Dichev, Agre, Angelova, 2015, Simões, Redondo, Vilas, 2013, de Sousa Borges, Durelli, Reis, Isotani, 2014) and in various subjects (Dichev, Dicheva, 2017, Dicheva, Dichev, Agre, Angelova, 2015, Kasurinen, Knutas, 2018, Seaborn, Fels, 2015), showing its potential to improve learning outcomes (Koivisto, Hamari, 2019, Seaborn, Fels, 2015).
According to reviews of gamification literature, gamification has been employed mostly in the field of education (Koivisto, Hamari, 2019, Majuri, Koivisto, Hamari, 2018, Seaborn, Fels, 2015). Gamified educational applications have been applied in non-academic areas as well: language teaching (Duolingo counts 300 million active users1) or software using (Ribbon Hero by Microsoft). Other popular gamified applications are: Kahoot and Quizizz, which can be easily configured and used in a variety of subjects, bringing game elements into classrooms without any special effort. Although gamification has an important position in education both inside and outside universities, there is still little effective guidance on how to combine different gamification features to enhance learning performance in different educational contexts (Hanus, Fox, 2015, Koivisto, Hamari, 2019, Seaborn, Fels, 2015).
Beyond research problems pertaining to the general interest in gamification and its effect on education, statistics education is an increasingly fundamental skill to understand the world around us. The lack of data literacy has been deemed one of the main causes behind our inability to act against climate change, to properly ratify means towards e.g. COVID-19 or generally as a hindrance for public understanding of science. Therefore, there is a need to make teaching methods in statistics and forecasting more engaging (Love and Hildebrand, 2002). The acceleration of the daily data production, and ever-greater capacity to store and process this information, has boosted the necessity for students with a strong background in statistics and predictive analytics skills, in business environments or even in everyday life. Consequently, both statistics and forecasting techniques are of vital importance in the economics curriculum (Loomis and Cox Jr, 2003) and in other fields such as business (Makridakis et al., 2008) or social problems, where data may help to make better decisions. However, often forecasting courses are not even offered as an independent course in business schools (Hanke, 1989) and when they are, students are discouraged to participate in the courses because they find the topic too complicated (Albritton, McMullen, 2006, Gardner, 2008, Snider, Eliasson, 2013, Torres, Babo, Mendonça, 2018) and demanding (Craighead, 2004). Therefore, regarding the education and especially the education in the field of statistics and forecasting, student motivation is crucial for their participation and understanding in order to reach their learning potential, meet business needs and get insights of the data to support the decision-making process.
Despite the long tradition in educational business games, thus far there have only been a few studies on gamification or simple gamified exercises, combined with traditional teaching methods in the area of statistical forecasting. These studies have mostly used: score (Craighead, 2004), spreadsheets (Gardner, 2008), competition (Snider and Eliasson, 2013) and real-world forecasting problems (Buckley, Doyle, 2016, Gavirneni, 2008) in order to encourage students' participation, without examining gamification effects. Other more quantitative studies have used forecasting in the context of a prediction market as a tool to motivate students rather than to teach forecasting aspects (Buckley, Doyle, 2016, Buckley, Doyle, 2016, Buckley, Doyle, 2017, Buckley, Garvey, McGrath, 2011). While there are several types of games and gamification designs, the challenge-based gamification (e.g points, levels, leaderboard, clear goals/ tasks), as opposed to the immersion- and the social-based gamification, has been suggested (Dicheva, Dichev, Agre, Angelova, 2015, de Sousa Borges, Durelli, Reis, Isotani, 2014, Zichermann, Cunningham, 2011) and applied to a high degree in practice as gamification design in education (Koivisto, Hamari, 2019, Seaborn, Fels, 2015, de Sousa Borges, Durelli, Reis, Isotani, 2014). One or more of these gamification elements have been used with promising results even in educational topics relative to forecasting (Craighead, 2004, Gavirneni, 2008, Gel, O’Hara Hines, Chen, Noguchi, Schoner, 2014, Snider, Eliasson, 2013). However, there is still a lack of effective design guides and empirical data on the combination or integration of these features in the context of educational information systems (Koivisto and Hamari, 2019). Challenge-based gamification introduces a design approach of integrating achievement gamification features, positively related with intrinsic need satisfaction (Xi and Hamari, 2019), in an educational service or application, in order to explore its potential, motivate users and eventually improve learning.
The present study examines the impact of three treatments on students’ performance i) reading, ii) use of a challenge-based gamified application, iii) the combination of the two. In order to do that, we consider a variety of student characteristics such as gender, level of studies, academic major, expertise in the English language, and use of personal computers and games. We designed and implemented a web-based gamified application, called Horses for Courses and we conducted a series of experiments over the last 4 years. The total sample is composed of 365 students, with 279 undergraduate and MBA students at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering of the National Technical University of Athens, Greece (hereafter ECE, NTUA) and 86 undergraduate students at the Business Administration Department in the School of Business and Economics of the University of Thessaly, Greece (hereafter Business Administration). Our findings show that challenge-based gamification improves students’ learning outcomes on a statistics course, contributing to the knowledge of challenge-based gamification’s effect on statistics/stem education and eventually on gamified pedagogy.
