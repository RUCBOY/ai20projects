Recent advancement in computer vision-based crowd surveillance has drawn the interests of the researchers and law enforcing agencies across the globe. Automatic visual surveillance through expert decision-making systems often result in efficient crowd monitoring and management with higher accuracy and better information fusion. Moreover, such experts and intelligent systems can reduce human efforts, leading to fewer errors in estimation. Expert systems guided automatic visual surveillance frameworks can promptly indicate unusual behavior or activity in the crowd. Therefore, precautionary measures can be taken to avoid undesirable incidents. Such systems can also be used to understand the behavior of people in crowded situations. However, the existing systems are primarily targeted for low or medium density crowds and are not suitable for handling dense crowds such as religious festivals, social and political gatherings (Junior, Musse, & Jung, 2010).
Visual understanding of crowd video reveals that structured crowd usually move together in groups of similar orientations. Developing an expert system that can describe crowd flow, is a challenging task. Existing works (Junior, Musse, Jung, 2010, Yogameena, Nagananthini, 2017) reveal that physics or particle dynamics-model based models are better in describing crowd flows as compared to non-physics guided models. However, physics-based systems are usually tested through simulations. Even though computer vision-based systems are available (Junior, Musse, Jung, 2010, Yogameena, Nagananthini, 2017), they are limited in numbers and capabilities. In this paper, a physics-based new expert model is proposed to understand movements in a dense crowd using Langevin equation. The proposed model when used along with computer vision techniques, can successfully segment motion flows in dense crowded scenarios with better accuracy.
1.1. Related workFlow detection and segmentation are key components to develop automatic crowd monitoring systems. Existing research work on crowd flow segmentation are either physics/particle dynamics-based or computer vision guided expert systems, as mentioned in (Zhang, Yu, & Yu, 2018).1.1.1. Physics or particle dynamics-based methodsIn case of physics-based or particle dynamics-based methods, typical fluid-flow model or freely moving particles on-air may not be directly applied to crowd data. For example, Langevin theory of Brownian motion cannot be directly applied to crowd dynamics. However, such physics-based models can be adopted with context imposed restrictions. For example, correlating the actual forces in dense, crowded situations with particle dynamics can be interesting. Off late, such models have started to emerge (Zhang et al., 2018). Ali and Shah (2007) have used Lagrange particle dynamics to segment high-density crowd flows. The same framework has also been used for detecting instabilities in crowd flows. Zhong, Ding, Wu, and Xu (2008) have used Markov Random Field to define crowd energy upon which wavelet analysis has been performed to detect abnormal behaviors. However, the method is not independent of the background, and it is sensitive to video shaking. Ali and Shah (2008) have used a scene-structure-based force model to detect individuals in a high-density crowd by analyzing its static, dynamic, and boundary floor fields. The algorithm is highly computation intensive. Mehran, Moore, and Shah (2010) have used streaklines for crowd flow analysis. They have used social force graph technique and streaklines to analyze the flow. Ji, Chi, and Lu (2017) have proposed a method based on the social force model to detect crowd anomaly at pixel and block levels. In Wu et al. (2017), the authors perform analysis of the crowd based on a bilinear interaction of curl and divergence of the flows. In Ullah et al. (2017), a density-independent hydrodynamics model (DIHM) for coherency detection in crowded scenes, has been proposed. The method can handle changing density over time. The method doesn’t perform finer-level crowd flow segmentation. A spatio-temporal driving force model has been proposed in Li and Chellappa (2010) to perform group segmentation in crowded scenarios. However, the model is not view-variant, and it needs to learn for different views with different parameter settings. Chen, Wang, and Yung (2011), have presented an adaptive human motion analysis and prediction method for understanding the motion patterns in crowds. Solmaz, Moore, and Shah (2012) have proposed a method to identify multiple crowd behaviors through stability analysis for dynamical systems avoiding object detection, tracking, or training. Their method cannot capture the randomness in a crowd. In Lin et al. (2016), coherent regions in a crowded scene are detected based on the thermal diffusion process and time-series clustering. The coherency is lost as the method merges both the motion and non-motion regions over time. The agent-based method proposed in Kountouriotis, Thomopoulos, and Papelis (2014) can model crowd behavior based on group dynamics and agent-based personality traits. Though their method performs reasonably well in real-time scenarios, its performance ceases with the increase in the number of agents. Zhou, Tang, and Wang (2015), have proposed a new mixture model of dynamic pedestrian-Agents (MDA) to learn the collective behavioral patterns of pedestrians in crowded scenes. However, it is unclear how their method can handle varying density. Su, Yang, Zheng, Fan, and Wei (2013), have proposed a spatio-temporal viscous fluid field to recognize the large-scale crowd behavior from appearance and driven factor perspectives. An application of real-time monitoring of crowd density at Puri Rath Yatra, combined with modeling evacuation scenarios using agent-based simulation, has been proposed in Basak and Gupta (2017). The technique is useful in predicting scenarios in emergency situations even though the technique is computationally expensive. The model proposed in Nicolas, Kuperman, Ibañez, Bouzat, and Appert-Rolland (2019) describes the crowd behavior in the presence of intruders in terms of velocity and density. The model described in Ye et al. (2019) is used to understand pedestrian walking characteristics in both uni-directional and bi-directional flows. However, the experiments have been conducted under controlled environment consisting of balanced human flows.1.1.2. Computer vision-based methodsConventional computer vision-based techniques like optical flow-based methods have been instrumental in flow segmentation. The method proposed in Cheriyadat and Radke (2008) finds dominant motions of the crowd by clustering low-level feature point tracks in videos. Wu, Yu, and Wong (2009a) have presented a region growing segmentation scheme based on the translational domain for segmenting crowd flows. The method fails if the translational flow is not local. Santoro, Pedro, Tan, and Moeslund (2010) have used Lucas-Kanade Tracker along with the density-based clustering for analysis of crowd motion. In the last step, a crowd tracker has been applied in each frame of the video. The authors claim their method can detect and track crowd with various shapes. However, the calculations are based on 2D coordinates of the motion point. Thus, the distance calculation between the motion points is not accurate. Moreover, the time complexity increases with the increase in motion points. Wu, Yu, and Wong (2009b), have proposed a new framework for crowd movement analysis. The crowd flow segmentation is performed using the optical flow field. An interpolation method based on Delaunay Triangulation has been used to estimate the smooth optical flow field robustly. Motion regions are then clustered, and a shape derivative technique is combined with a region growing scheme to segment a crowd. However, the method cannot detect all motion regions in a typical crowd. Lu, Wei, Xing, and Liu (2017) have proposed a trajectory clustering-based method to understand crowd motion patterns. The method in Nasir, Lim, Nahavandi, and Creighton (2014) aims to generate accurate sequence waypoints for the pedestrian walking path by analyzing videos in closed environments only. Anwar, Petrounias, Morris, and Kodogiannis (2012) have developed an anomaly detection method to analyze anomalous events. However, the proposed method works at the microscopic level. An Interval-Based Spatio-Temporal Model (IBSTM) has been proposed in Kardas and Cicekli (2017) in order to detect untoward events in a video. However, the proposed method is a microscopic event model that cannot deal with macroscopic events such as crowd flow. The method proposed in Walia, Raza, Gupta, Asthana, and Singh (2017) uses a multi-stage tracker for precise localization of targets. However, this model is a microscopic expert model aimed at tracking individual humans only. In Mao, Li, Li, and He (2019), emotion of individual people has been modeled to understand crowd behavior during various crowded scenarios. However, the proposed model is a microscopic-based agent model. Fernández-Caballero, Castillo, and Rodríguez-Sánchez (2012) have proposed a finite state machines-based technique for human activity monitoring in a closed scene. The method needs to have prior information about the source and destination points. The method described in Zhou, Tang, Zhang, and Wang (2014) segments the motion flow in sparse crowds in terms of collectiveness. Fradi, Luvison, and Pham (2017) have proposed local descriptors that provide semantic information and interactive sparse crowd behaviors. However, it is not clear how the method handles densely crowded situations. The global grid motion templates have been used for crowd analysis and management in Li, Yang, and Liu (2018) for anomaly detection. However, any loss in motion patterns in any of the grid may lead to failure in anomaly detection. The method proposed in Lamba and Nain (2019) uses active contour segmentation to segment crowded regions, followed by block-level tracking, and clustering to segment crowds. However, the proposed method is time-consuming as it can not guarantee to obtain the foreground regions in the first iteration.Traditional computer vision algorithms amalgamated with machine learning techniques have also been used for performing crowd flow segmentation in videos. Cao, Zhang, Ren, and Huang (2015) have performed large scale crowd analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The authors have combined CNN guided classification with regression to get accurate results. However, an extensive database with proper labeling must be available for such a method to be successful. Zhou et al. (2016) have proposed a Spatio-Temporal CNN (STCNN) for crowd anomaly detection. In Kruthiventi and Babu (2015), crowd flow analysis is performed using Conditional Random Field. However, the method is incapable of handling intersecting flows. Deep learning-based optical flow schemes are also proposed in Dosovitskiy et al. (2015) and (Ilg et al., 2017) to predict the optical flow of consecutive frames based on Convolution Neural Networks. But, they do not address the dynamics of typical crowded scenarios. The methods proposed in Shao, Kang, Loy, and Wang (2015) and Long, Shelhamer, and Darrell (2015) are based on deep learning techniques for scene understanding and semantic segmentation. However, these methods are unable to describe the dynamics of the crowd. Chaker, Al Aghbari, and Junejo (2017) have proposed an unsupervised approach for crowd scene anomaly detection based on the social network model. In the paper (Wu, Ye, Zhao, & Shi, 2018), collective density clustering is performed for the detection of coherent crowd regions. However, the method is dependent on the stability and accuracy of the tracking algorithm. In Direkoglu, Sah, and O’Connor (2017), the angle difference between optical flow vectors has been used as a feature that is then fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for detecting abnormality in a crowd. In Wang et al. (2018), crowd anomaly detection has been performed using optical flow features and Hidden Markov model (HMM). Yuan, Wan, and Wang (2016) have proposed a sparse representation method for crowd anomaly detection. The work presented in Chan and Vasconcelos (2008) and Ma, Cisar, and Kembhavi (2009) are based on a dynamic mixture model of textures and expected-maximization (EM) algorithm. Such methods can segment motion in traffic and crowd videos. However, the authors have not provided any evidence on how it addresses the crowd in terms of varying density.

1.2. MotivationThe aforementioned work summarized in the following observations have motivated us to develop the proposed physics-based expert system model:•The methods similar to Santoro et al. (2010) are restricted to only low and medium density crowds. These methods lack robustness in handling densely crowded scenarios.•Though the physics-based (Chaker et al., 2017) and particle-dynamics-based (Ali & Shah, 2007) expert models partially address the issues in densely crowded scenarios, they are complex in functionality and often lead to increased execution time. Moreover, such methods lack simplicity from the point of implementation.•It has also been understood that none of the existing intelligent or expert systems based on physics or particle dynamics such as Ali and Shah (2007) or Ullah et al. (2017) can model the crowd phenomenon as random particles. This has been one of the key motivations behind the idea presented in this paper.
1.3. ContributionsIn view of the aforementioned limitations and motivated by the facts presented earlier, we have made the following technical contributions that are primarily in the field of expert and intelligent systems:•We propose a physics-based expert system model to understand the dense crowd flow in videos using Langevin theory of Brownian particles in fluid.•Using the aforementioned model, we propose an intelligent flow segmentation algorithm that can segment linear and near-linear flows in videos of dense crowd gatherings with the help of a context adaptive force model.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The foundation of Langevin equation is explained in Section 2. In Section 3, we explain how Langevin equation can be adopted for designing expert decision making system to understand crowd flow through segmentation. The results and discussions are presented in Section 4 using public datasets as well as using our video dataset. In Section 5, we have concluded the paper with possible future directions.
