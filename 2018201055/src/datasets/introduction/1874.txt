The use of transcendental functions is widely employed in science and engineering because they allow to perform the modelling and simulation of physical phenomena. Importance of transcendental functions is given by the fact that they can be found, practically, in all mathematical analysis which has enhanced development of theoretical sciences and the creation of new technologies. Transcendental functions allow to perform the analysis of mechanical vibration in the field of physics [1], the analysis of alternating current in electrical circuits [1], [2], electro magnetics theory [3], quantum mechanics [4], optics [5], digital signal processing [6], electronic circuit oscillator generated waveform [7], the modelling of wave heat conduction [8], among others. Another application for transcendental functions, in the case of logarithms, is its use in Bode analysis [2], [9], [10] for the creation of phase and magnitude plots.
The development of mathematical tools to perform analysis such as Fourier [11], [12] and Laplace transform [1], [13], has been possible through transcendental functions. Furthermore, hyperbolic functions also play an important role in mathematical analysis for science and engineering; for instance, in civil engineering, they have applications in the study and design of catenary forms in chains and cables for suspended bridges [14], in electrical engineering for the design of free hanging electric power cables [15], [16], [17]; also, in naval and civil engineering, for the modelling of sea wave behaviour [18], among other applications.
Several historical records show that the use of trigonometry comes from ancient civilizations such as Hindu and Chinese [19]. For instance, in Babylonian civilization trigonometry was employed to perform agricultural measurements of land; also, it was used during pyramid construction in Egypt, showing how Egyptians had some knowledge of triangle numerical relations, that was called a kind of proto-trigonometry [20]. This knowledge was passed on to the Greeks and, around century II B.C., Hipparchus of Nicaea (190-120), known as the father of trigonometry, was the first to construct a trigonometric table chart.
Also, in the II century B.C., Claudius Ptolemy (85-165) continued the improvement of Hipparchus' works providing examples on how to utilize the tables on the solution of rectangle triangles. In India, the developing of trigonometric system was based on the sine function; one of the mayor contributions of this civilization was the development of the sexagesimal system. The first sine table ever constructed was found in Aryabhatiya, written by Aryabhata I (475-550); nevertheless, the word it sine appeared for the first time in the manuscripts of Gerard of Cremona (1114-1187) who translated texts from Greek to Latin, including the Almagest [20]. In Europe, after the end of the Middle Ages, in 1453 A.C. with the fall of Constantinople by the Ottoman Turk empire, Johannes Müller Von Königsberg (1436-1476), known as Regiomontanus, in [21] presented the methods to solve triangles [22], which started the renaissance of trigonometry. Besides, this work introduced the Law of Sines and included practical problems to determine triangle sides [22], [23]. By 1551 A.C., Georg Joachim Rheticus (1514-1574) presented the first publication of a trigonometric table that included the six elemental functions [24]. His work was the first to define the six trigonometric functions as ratios of a triangle sides; although, he used different names for the ratios. Thomas Fincke (1561-1556) proposed to abbreviate the trigonometric functions with a notation that included dots, which is the base for today's used notation [25]. In addition to that, Fincke introduces the terms tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant [26].
Along with the mathematical advancements, arithmetic symbols underwent changes. For instance, in 1557 Robert Recorde (1510-1558), mathematician and physician, introduced the equal sign (=) [27]. Nonetheless, equal sign will be used until 1618. Algebra also suffered modifications, François Viète (1540-1603) introduced in [28] the new algebra that consisted in the use of alphabet letters to represent variables, constant or indeterminate terms in any equation. In [29], Viète presents formulas related to sines and cosines, which gave place to the first trigonometry tables of our era since the Arab mathematicians in the tenth century. Also, in [29], algebra was applied to trigonometry. Viète discovered most of the elementary trigonometric identities and obtains the general formulas equivalent to the expressions of sin⁡(nx) and cos⁡(nx) in function of sin⁡(x) and cos⁡(x). Among important trigonometry identities, we have:(1)sin⁡(A+B)+sin⁡(A−B)=2sin⁡(A)cos⁡(B),sin⁡(A−B)−sin⁡(A−B)=2sin⁡(B)cos⁡(A),cos⁡(A−B)+cos⁡(A+B)=2cos⁡(A)cos⁡(B).
Later on, trigonometric identities were employed to perform multiplication and division [30]. Works from Jost Börgi contributed to the development of new methods and trigonometric formulas employed in the Prostaphaeresis by the end of sixteenth century [31].
In the sixteenth century, arithmetical calculation became important due to the commercial expansion and perfection of navigation which made necessary to find less laborious algorithms, mainly for multiplication and division. This fact gave place to the logarithm discovery; although their beginning is from Archimedes' era [32]. In Edinburgh, by 1614, John Napier (1550-1617) published the first logarithm table [33]; in 1619, after Napier's death, the procedure for logarithm construction was published [34]. Henry Briggs in 1617 proposed the base-10 logarithm [35] and, in 1624, [36] presented an extended table that contained the logarithm for 30000 natural numbers with 14 significant digits. By 1620, Edmund Gunter (1581-1626) continued the works from Briggs and Napier, providing the tables [37], where the base-10 logarithm for sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent trigonometric functions are calculated. Nevertheless, a few years before, Michael Stifel (1487-1567) in 1544 published a table of logarithms [38] that presented calculations with powers of an arbitrary rational exponent, and particularly, the multiplication rule given by(2)anam=an+m, for rational numbers.
In 1748, L. Euler publishes [39], [40] which studies elementary functions and geometric curves, without recurring to integral and differential calculus. In there, he introduces the concept of function referring to the logarithmic, exponential, and trigonometric expressions. Besides, Euler presents the notation for x logarithm base a as it is known nowadays (loga⁡(x)), and introduces the number e as the natural base [39]. Likewise, in [39], Euler presents the exponential and logarithm functions with their respective power series.
Euler classified addition, multiplication, subtraction, division, raising to a power, and n-th roots as algebraic operations; while classifying non algebraic operations as transcendentals [39], [41]. Thus, Euler labelled trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic as transcendental functions [39], [41]; in this way, classified functions as algebraic and transcendental. It is important to note that nowadays, addition, multiplication, and division are considered as arithmetic operations [42] which are part of fundamental algebra.
Johann H. Lambert (1728-1777) was the first to publish a treatise of hyperbolic functions in 1761 [43]. The name of hyperbolic function comes from the comparison between a semi-circular surface area and a hyperbola section area [44]. In his work, Lambert did not introduce a notation for these functions; although, he did find the analogy between these functions and circular trigonometric functions [43], [44]. Lambert continued his work on hyperbolic functions and their similitude to circular trigonometric functions [44]. But it was until then that Lambert provided a notation for them, to be differentiated from the traditional trigonometric functions. Nevertheless, this notation was different as we use it nowadays by [44], [45] which includes an extensive list of multiple angles identities derived from:(3)sin⁡hypv=exp⁡(v)−exp⁡(−v)2,cos⁡hypv=exp⁡(v)+exp⁡(−v)2, where (3) is presented with the original notation proposed by Lambert in [44], [45].
The main reason for Lambert to work on hyperbolic functions was to simplify triangles sides and angles calculation. Besides that, Vincenzo Riccati (1707-1775) worked with hyperbolic functions, between 1757-1772, using a hyperbole to define functions that he called sinus hyperbolico and cosinus hyperbolico [46]. On his work, he also determined the representation of power series for these functions. In [47], Ricatti developed the theory of hyperbolic functions including some hyperbolic identities, their derivatives, and its relation to exponential function [45].
In 1758, Lambert solves the equation x=q+xn by giving a series development for x in powers of q [48]. Later, Euler modified it [49] to(4)xα−bβ=(α−β)vxα+β.
Works from Lambert and Eisenstein [50], among others, led to the development of Lambert function W(x), defined as the inverse of(5)yexp⁡(y)=x, its solution given by(6)y=W(x).
The inverse of (5) was proposed by Pólya and Szegö in 1925 [51]. The convention to identify Lambert function with W was possible for the early works of Edward Maitland Wright and his contributions of delay differential equations (DDEs) [52], [53]. From 1949 to 1959 Wright had good results solving (5), which is the characteristic equation associated to DDE x′=Bx(t−r) [52], [53], [54]. Nevertheless, the use of Lambert W function started in 1973, when [55] presented a numerical algorithm to solve (5) coded in Fortran computer language. This algorithm allowed the calculation of real solutions when x>0. The importance of Lambert W function was not really appreciated until the 1990s when Corless and developers of the Maple mathematical software performed an exhaustive research and found that this function had practical applications [56], [57].

Table 1 shows that existence of trigonometric functions dates back to ancient civilizations and played an important role in the determination of object dimensions. Furthermore, its evolution throughout the centuries is observed. Nevertheless, after Middle Ages, the improvement of these functions notoriously continued until 17th century, time when logarithms were born and in 1620 the logarithmic tables for traditional trigonometric functions were published in the works of Edmund Gunter. Besides, the works from Riccatti and Lambert were of high importance because they proposed hyperbolic functions and their properties, which initiates the modern use of transcendental functions with the notation that we know today. Later on, J.H. Lambert, in 1758, provided the principles for a new transcendental function (W(x)) that was almost unknown until 1990s, including its applications to science and engineering. This function was fully developed until 1925 by Pólya and Szegö [51] moreover, thanks to the algorithms implemented by Corless & developers [57], this function began to be widely employed by the end of 20th century.
In this article, we present a novel and interesting family of functions with new algebraic properties, which, from now on, we will denominate as Leal family of transcendental functions. In literature when it is encountered a nonlinear equation which is not possible to solve analytically for one of the variables, it is necessary the application of numerical algorithms like Newton-Raphson method, or regula-falsi method, among others [58]. Likewise, when solving a nonlinear differential equation, conventional techniques could not be employed, thus, numerical techniques such as Runge Kutta, among others [58], [59], [60], are employed. Nevertheless, the problem of using numerical methods is that in occasions they exhibit instabilities, oscillations, and divergences; besides of requiring a certain high computing power, among other consequences [58]. Another disadvantage in the use of numerical algorithms is due to the fact that these algorithms do not provide exact solutions that would allow performing other types of mathematical analysis or conclusions [10], [61], [62]. It is important to remark that the main reason of using numerical algorithms for the solution of nonlinear problems lies in the fact that known transcendental functions do not possess the necessary algebraic properties to obtain an exact solution. In consequence, a family of transcendental functions will be presented along with their respective differentiation and integration rules, with some of their properties and identities. A key aspect taken into account in this research will be the proposal of a series of analytic approximations that allows to evaluate the transcendental family of Leal-functions in terms of known transcendental functions and polynomial expressions. Such approximate functions have the advantage of being handy and easy computable, providing highly accurate results. These expressions will be obtained by using Power Series Extender Method (PSEM) [63], [64], [65], [66], which is simple to use and does not require either integral calculations or existence of perturbative parameters, among other characteristics.
This research article is organized as follows, Section 2 presents some characteristics of the known transcendental functions. Section 3 shows an introduction of PSEM. In Section 4, we introduce the family of Leal-functions. Section 5, indicates the process of approximation of Leal-functions. In Section 6, we present the procedure that is applied in all proposed functions in this work. Next, Section 7 presents three interesting applications. An algorithm to improve the accuracy of the PSEM approximations is presented in Section 8. Section 9 shows the computation time and discussion. Section 10 presents the concluding remarks and future work of this research.
