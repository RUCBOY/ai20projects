Research on road lane detection using image processing and machine learning techniques was an important research field both in developed countries and in developing countries [1]. As the number of vehicles grew, numerous intelligent systems were built to help drivers drive safely. Lane detection is an essential aspect of any driver assistance program. There are currently several major challenges facing researchers working on lane detection, such as attaining reliability to variations in the lighting and background clutter. Fig. 1 presents some challenging road lane samples. In recent years, the advancement of image processing techniques and the availability of low-cost visual sensing equipment have paved the way for various methods of automatic road lane detection [2]. The feasibility of automatic road lane detection approaches stems from the fact that the textures of lanes are recognizably different from the background of the pavement surface [3]. In recent days applying image processing technique and artificial intelligence (AI) method for enhancing the accuracy and productivity of the task of interest is increased. Moreover, irregular background illumination and complex pavement texture/color are still major challenges that computer vision-based methods have to overcome. Hence, other advanced approaches of image processing and AI should be investigated to construct automatic road boundary lane detection models. The current study is dedicated to establish a new AI based model for automatically recognizing boundary lanes in asphalt pavement images.
