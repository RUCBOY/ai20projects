Nowadays, modern computer networks have become critical infrastructures, so that enterprise networks and data centers can transfer traffic to private users, companies, and states [35]. Software-defined networks (SDN) is a new generation of networks that can handle most network management and routing tasks using the virtual layer, central controller, communication standards, and high-level APIs [37], [38]. SDN offers an interesting opportunity to design trusted and reliable computer networks to better meet the needs of users [27], [37]. Briefly speaking, the control over switches is outsourced in SDN, and switches are managed by a logically centralized software called a controller [27], [37], [38]. SDN is a reliable and secure network whose paradigm is based on the trustworthiness of hardware [27], [38]. The assumption that routing devices are trusted is in doubt because switches and routers have been compromised over the years [3], [5], [22]. In addition, there have been many vulnerabilities in routers and switches in network infrastructure [28]. Moreover, some networking equipment manufacturers deliberately put open backdoors in their equipment to gain access to these devices when needed [34], [39]. As SDN is transmitted to manufacturing networks, it is thought that similar security issues can occur for Openflow [37] switches. One of the major issues in SDN, which is posed as a major challenge, is security [24]. One of the security challenges of SDN is secure routing SR, and the assumption that routers and switches are trusted is still controversial. In other words, in the routing process, attackers would be able to compromise switches and routers, including infiltrated routers that can be converted to malicious nodes helping to launch attacks such as denial of service (DOS), inaccurate routing, packet removal, and even bypassing defense mechanisms such as firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) [4], [26]. Corporations and organizations have been limited to the possibility of developing their own network hardware for more assured reliability and efficiency. Instead, they often need to use hardware devices from vendors or third-parties [12].Download : Download high-res image (207KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Routing in an SDN with untrusted switches.
Untrusted routing devices (switches or routers) in the network can cause serious threats. The notion of “untrusted” could come from two aspects. First, the manufacturers place a backdoor or a path for intrusion into the devices for spying or general misuse [16]. Secondly, malicious entities can exploit bugs in the software of the devices at runtime, which hackers can use for malicious purposes [9]. As a result, a compromised routing device continues to work as a malicious node in the network. These malicious nodes can then transmit or mirror wrongful packets that can cause intrusion in data centers and the removal of private sensitive information [4], [26]. Additionally, a malicious router can simply overload the network through a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. For example, a SDN as depicted in Fig. 1 includes three types of components: controller, SDN switches, and hosts. Imagine H1, H2, H4 and H5 are the secure hosts, and H3 host is the malicious one. S1, S2, S5, S7 and S8 are the SDN switches, S3 and S6 are the untrusted switches, and S4 is the compromised switch via H3. In this scenario, H1 sends packets to H5 which passes S3 along the route, but the wrong routing is carried out and it is directed towards H4, or H2 sends packets to H5 which passes S6 along the route, but the wrong routing occurs and it is directed towards H4.
In Fig. 1, H3 is a malicious host that attacks S4 and compromises this switch. This malicious switch then causes untrusted routing. This issue underlies the motivation of this research to investigate if SR is possible when components (switches and routers) are untrusted and/or have untrusted behaviors. Undoubtedly, there is a need for secure and high-reliability routing at the network level. Encryption methods have been mainly employed to deal with some of these routing problems. Cryptographic approaches, however, require additional infrastructure and usually require additional time as well as computational complexity overhead. At runtime, such approaches often create additional overheads that are undesirable in high-performance networks [12]. Moreover, cryptographic traffic may leak sensitive information such as time and frequency of communications. Finally, cryptographic solutions cannot cope with DoS threats [7], [23], and currently there are no devices to verify and correct the behavior of routers or switches [12], [25] to help SR. Presuming untrusted devices, one of the most trusted routing methods is to replicate devices using switches and routers. However, using the replicated method results in higher implementation and management costs on the network itself.
1.1. Goals of the studyOwing to the fact that there are many vulnerabilities in SDN, our main motivation is to securely route with untrusted devices. In this research, we provide cost optimization of SR with untrusted devices in SDN. The specific objectives are as follows:•In order to find the optimal number of replicated devices, the problem is modeled and converted into a multi-objective optimization problem.•Two objective functions are based on maximum reliability and minimum cost.•The NSGA-II algorithm [10] is used to find an optimal solution.•Our approach provides SR with high reliability and low cost of implementation on SDN with untrusted devices.The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 examines the methods and related works in the field of trusted routing. In Section 3, the proposed method and the mathematical model of the problem are presented. Section 4, evaluates and implements the proposed method using the NSGA-II algorithm. Finally, Section 5 gives some concluding remarks.
