Active noise control (ANC) technology has been widely studied and applied due to its low cost, effectiveness at low-frequency, and simple implementations [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. However, with an increasing complexity of modern electric, magnetic and acoustic environments, the linear theories and algorithms may not be effective when facing the nonlinearity and/or chaos which may be caused by the chaotic reference noise, nonlinear primary path (NPP) and/or nonlinear secondary path (NSP) [3], [4], [5]. Therefore, the nonlinear ANC (NANC) has been inspired. The nonlinear adaptive filters equipped with the associated adaptive algorithms were proposed to tackle these problems.Table 1.

As shown in Fig. 1, the nonlinear filter is generated by expanding the reference noise of x(n) using nonlinear functions of f(▪). The active controller produces the anti-noise of y(n) to alleviate the noise source at the superposition point denoted as d(n). The primary path from the noise source to the superposition point is denoted by p(n), while the secondary path from the controller output to the canceling point is designated as s(n) which can be estimated by s¯(n) using the online or offline system identification techniques [5], [6]. As illusrated in Fig. 1, the function expansion reference is filtered by the secondary estimate. The algorithm, called filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm, uses the filtered functiona expansion reference and the error residual of e(n) to update the weight coefficients of w(n).Download : Download high-res image (128KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Diagonal structure and bilinear terms for the CRTDB filter (P=1, N=3).
The nonlinear filters can be divided into three categories: function expansion filters [2], [3], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], recursive filters [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], and bilinear filters [17], [18], [19], [20]. The function expansion filters have advantages of low computational loads and linear signal elements-weights relationship. The Volterra filter and functional link artificial neural network (FLANN) filter were the most famous ones among them. In addition, the Volterra filter outperforms the FLANN filter when dealing with the crossing term nonlinearity. To improve the control performance, various types of function expansion filters have been designed for controlling noises, such as the general FLANN filter [7], [8], even mirror Fourier nonlinear (EMFN) filter [9], [10], exponential functional link network (EFLN) filter [11], et al. Motivated by the function expansion filters, the recursive filters [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] and function expansion bilinear (FEB) filters [18], [19], [20] were proposed to further improve the performance. In comparison with the recursive filters, the FEB filters offer preeminent ability in processing nonlinearity for NANC systems [21]. However, the huge computational load and bounded input bounded output (BIBO) unstable problem hinder the practical applications. In this paper, an efficient implementation for the FEB filter and two BIBO stable control methods are proposed to reduce the computational load and overcome the unstable problem.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 illustrates design of the efficient channel reduced FEB (CRFEB) filter with channel reduced 3-dimensional (CR-3D) diagonal structures. Section 3 provides two BIBO stable strategies to ensure the stable operation for the proposed FEB filters. Section 4 derives the associate adaptive FXLMS algorithm using a feedforward duct ANC model, together with the comparisons of computational complexity. Section 5 presents simulations to show the satisfied performance. Finally, the conclusions are given in Section 6.
