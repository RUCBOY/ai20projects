The concept of covering numbers can be traced back to the work of Kolmogorov [25], [26] and became since then an important tool used in several areas of theoretical and applied mathematics. Furthermore, Pietsch introduced in his book [34] a formal definition of an inverse function of covering numbers under the name of entropy numbers. Later on, Carl and Triebel [9], [11] investigated the relation between entropy numbers and other geometric and approximation quantities related to sets and operators, most importantly to eigenvalues of compact operators.
Due to the natural definition of covering and entropy numbers, and due to their relations to other geometric notions, these concepts found applications in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, including geometry of Banach spaces [2], [3], [5], [6], [8], [18], [35], information theory [21], [36], [40], [41], [42], and random processes [29], [30]. They also appeared in the theory of compressed sensing [7], [13] in the study of optimality of recovery of sparse vectors and in the study of eigenvalue problems in Banach spaces [15], [27]. One of the most important classes of operators, whose entropy numbers are well understood and often applied, are the identities between finite-dimensional vector spaces. The main aim of this note is to present a self-contained overview of this area. To state the main result in detail, we need to recall some notation.
The couple (X,‖⋅‖X) is called a quasi-Banach space, if X is a real or complex vector space and the mapping ‖⋅‖X:X→[0,∞) satisfies

(i)‖x‖X=0 if, and only if, x=0,(ii)‖αx‖X=|α|⋅‖x‖X for all α∈R (or in ℂ) and all x∈X,(iii)there exists a constant C≥1 such that ‖x+y‖X≤C(‖x‖X+‖y‖X) for all x,y∈X,(iv)X is complete with respect to ‖⋅‖X.
If the constant C in (iii) can be chosen to be equal to one, X is actually a Banach space. If ‖⋅‖X satisfies the axioms above with (iii) replaced by ‖x+y‖Xp≤‖x‖Xp+‖y‖Xp,x,y∈Xfor some 0<p≤1, then (X,‖⋅‖X) is called a p-Banach space and ‖⋅‖X is a p-norm. It follows that a Banach space X is also a p-Banach space for p=1. It is easy to see that every p-norm is a quasi-norm with C=21∕p−1. On the other hand, by the Aoki–Rolewicz theorem [1], [37], every quasi-norm is equivalent to some p-norm for a suitably chosen p. We refer to [24] for a survey on quasi-Banach spaces.
If X is a vector space equipped with some (quasi-)norm or p-norm ‖⋅‖X, we denote by BX its unit ball, i.e. the set BX={x∈X:‖x‖X≤1}. The symbol L(X,Y) stands for the set of all bounded linear operators from X to Y. For 0<p≤∞, we define ℓpn(R) (or ℓpn(ℂ)) to be the Euclidean space Rn (or ℂn) equipped with the (quasi-)norm ‖x‖p=‖(xi)i=1n‖p=(∑i=1n|xi|p)1∕p,0<p<∞;max1≤i≤n|xi|,p=∞.The unit ball of ℓpn(R) will be denoted by Bpn. It is easy to see, that ℓpn(R) and ℓpn(ℂ) are Banach spaces if p≥1 and p-Banach spaces if 0<p≤1. Therefore, we will denote p̄=min(1,p) and use the triangle inequality in ℓpn(R) and ℓpn(ℂ) in the form ‖x+y‖pp̄≤‖x‖pp̄+‖y‖pp̄.
We define now the concept of entropy numbers of a bounded linear operator T between two (quasi-)Banach spaces X and Y. Essentially, we are allowed to use 2k−1 balls of radius r in Y to cover the image of the unit ball of X by T and ek(T) denotes the smallest r, for which this is still possible.
Definition 1Let X and Y be Banach spaces, p-Banach spaces, or quasi-Banach spaces. Let T:X→Y be a bounded linear operator and let k≥1 be a positive integer. The kth (dyadic) entropy number of T is defined as (1)ek(T)≔inf{r>0:∃y1,…,y2k−1∈YwithT(BX)⊂⋃j=12k−1(yj+rBY)}.
The relation of the entropy numbers to the covering numbers of Kolmogorov is quite straightforward. If K⊂Y and r>0, then the covering number N(K,Y,r) is the smallest number N such that there exist points y1,…,yN with K⊂⋃j=1N(yj+rBY). The entropy numbers ek(T) can then be equivalently defined as en(T)=inf{r>0:N(T(BX),Y,r)≤2k−1}.
The concept of covering numbers plays also a very important role in the local theory of Banach spaces and is of independent interest. It was used for example in the proof of the existence of M-ellipsoids, cf. [31], [32] and [35, Chapter 7].
Although easy to define, the entropy numbers of some specific operator T are usually rather difficult to calculate, or estimate. One class of operators, where the upper and lower bounds on entropy numbers are known, are the identities between finite-dimensional vector spaces. The main aim of this note is to present a self-contained proof of the following result.
Theorem 2Let 0<p,q≤∞ and let n∈N.(a)If 0<p≤q≤∞ then for all k∈N it holds (2)ek(id:ℓpn(R)→ℓqn(R))∼1if1≤k≤log2n,(log2(1+n∕k)k)1p−1qiflog2n≤k≤n,2−k−1nn1q−1pifn≤k.(b)If 0<q≤p≤∞ then for all k∈N it holds (3)ek(id:ℓpn(R)→ℓqn(R))∼2−k−1nn1q−1p.
The constants of equivalence in both (2) and (3) may depend on p and q, but are independent of k and n.
