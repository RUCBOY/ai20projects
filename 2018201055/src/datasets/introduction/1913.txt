With the advance of the internet of things (IoT), social media, and cloud computing, the amount of data storage and processing requirement in computer systems has exploded because the amount of data has tremendously increased. Furthermore, to quickly store and process this massive amount of data, high-performance computing systems are in demand. These changes in computing environments require a shift from processor-centric computing to memory-centric computing environments, which evokes the illusions of a system with infinite main memory from users.
However, the DRAM technology, which has been the basic component of the main memory for several decades, faces the scaling problem because of the inherent physical limitations, which also hinders the realization of the illusion of an infinite main memory. On one hand, the DRAM suffers from scaling limitation, low energy efficiency, and high cost [1]. On the other hand, emerging non-volatile memory technologies such as phase change memory (PCM), ferroelectric RAM (FRAM), and magnetic RAM (MRAM) have recently attracted considerable attention as promising replacements to fulfill the requirement of large-capacity memory [2], [3], [4]. These emerging non-volatile memories can simultaneously function as both working memory and persistent storage with attractive features of non-volatility and byte addressability [5]. In particular, the PCM, which is based on chalcogenide Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) material [6], is an attractive candidate to replace the DRAM because of its good density and zero cell leakage [7], [8], [9]. The PCM has faster access latency and longer lifetime than the NAND flash memory for persistent storage. Furthermore, unlike the DRAM for the working memory, it has no refresh power consumption and non-volatility. Therefore, recently, several studies were conducted to re-build a new memory hierarchy system using PCM [10], [11], [12], [13].
Phase-change-memory technologies consists of Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) material, which is capable of changing its resistance [14], and basically use two different states depending on resistance ratio, i.e., crystalline (SET state) and amorphous (RESET state) states. The resistance ratio between amorphous and crystalline states for ZS/SO is over one order of magnitude, and it is divided into several resistance intervals, allowing to store multiple bits in a single cell [9], [15], [16]. In order to program SET/RESET states, PCM technologies use iterative program-and-verify (P & V) process The iterative P & V write scheme repeatedly applies a SET pulse and then verify that the non-overlapping resistive distribution has been achieved [15].Download : Download high-res image (290KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Conventional architecture vs. memory-disk integrated system.
However, although PCM can be used for both working memory and persistent storage, PCM also suffers from drawbacks such as higher write access latency, asymmetric read/write access latencies, and limited endurance compared to the DRAM [17]. To overcome such limitations of the PCM and use the PCM as the working memory and persistent storage, a small amount of DRAM buffer is used [11], [12], [13]. In previous studies [11] and [13], the conventional main memory and storage layers are merged into a single memory layer using a non-volatile memory pool. In this approach, the DRAM buffer, which is placed between the last level cache and the persistent memory, acts as a type of caching layer to compensate the unfavorable features of the PCM. In particular, the hit rate of the caching layer of a cloud infrastructure is an important factor for its overall performance. According to Cidon et al. [18], a 1% increase in hit rate reduces the average latency by approximately 25%. Thus, this study proposes a PCM-based memory-disk integrated system (MDIS) with an aggressive prefetching buffer and its prefetching scheme for processing big data. This approach can realize infinite main memory illusion by merging the working memory and persistent storage. It can also hide the relatively slow write access latency and limited endurance of the PCM by designing the aggressive DRAM buffer.
The MDIS with its associated pattern adaptive prefetcher is to store and process big data for large data centers. Specifically, to enhance the spatial locality, we design small amount of dual DRAM buffers and pattern analysis based prefetching method for memory-intensive computing environments. The decoupled dual DRAM buffers consist of a large block prefetch buffer and an eviction buffer. The large block prefetch buffer is designed to prefetch a large block set at a time from the persistent memory. However, it may contain unnecessary data and potentially reusable data at the same time. Thus, the eviction buffer is designed to manage potentially reusable data among the sub-blocks of a large block set evicted from the prefetch buffer. In this system, to ensure the performance of the DRAM-based pattern adaptive prefetcher, we use a simple persistent memory array that consists of only PCM. The proposed structure is evaluated using a trace-driven simulator system and various data and memory-intensive workloads (YCSB [19] on Redis [20], Apache Storm [21], [22], Apache Spark [23], and OpenStack Swift [24]). The Execution traces including the memory foot-prints of the benchmarks are obtained from the load/store memory accesses and file I/O operations by processor requests using the QEMU emulator, where monitoring codes are inserted for memory and storage events. The experimental result shows that the MDIS with a pattern adaptive prefetcher reduces the total access time by 12.3% compared to the conventional scheme.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
