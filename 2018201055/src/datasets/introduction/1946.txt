The field of High-Performance Computing (HPC) has been seeing steady growth during the last 25 years. For example, based on the TOP500 list [1], the number one Supercomputer in 1995 used to deliver only 170 GFlops/s. In the latest June 2020 list, the number one supercomputer delivers 415.5 PFlops/s. The world is also heading into the ExaFlop era soon [2]. Such progress has been made possible by design and development in hardware and software technologies as well as applications.
Most of the parallel applications, during the last 25 years, continue to use Message Passing Interface (MPI) libraries conforming to the MPI Standard [3]. As the underlying hardware technologies (processor and networking) continue to evolve, it is the responsibility of the MPI library to extract and deliver performance, scalability, and fault-tolerance to the parallel applications. Thus, designing a high-performance, scalable, fault-tolerant, and production quality MPI library is important to the progress of the HPC field.
