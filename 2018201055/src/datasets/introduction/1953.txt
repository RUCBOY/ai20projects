Worldwide construction is a high-risk activity and a significant contributor to workplace accidents and fatalities that materialize from all industrial sectors [21], [28], [31], [47]. During construction, however, it has been found that 25% of fatalities are associated with plant (e.g., backhoes and excavators) and equipment [3]. Moreover, 75% of the fatalities that occur are due to people coming into direct contact with plant and equipment [49].
Computer vision has been advocated to support behavior-based safety (BBS) to manage safety proactively. In this instance, it has been used to identify the conditions that can result in unsafe behaviors and then put in place mechanisms to prevent their occurrence [4], [10], [43], [56], [37]. A limited amount of research, however, has been undertaken that has examined the nature of accidents that arise when a piece of plant strikes an individual via monocular images or unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [48], [19], [20], [23]. Despite the success of the work that has been undertaken to identify the unsafe behavior that has resulted in a person being struck by plant [19], [20], [23] several limitations that have hindered their accuracy, which include:
•The use of UAV's need to be manually operated. The transformation of each image's frame is also a manual process requiring the reference object (i.e. of known size) it be modified when outside the UAV's view [19], [20], [23];•The UAV is unable to identify and process a person being stuck-by a piece of plant in real-time when an accident occurs [19], [20], [23];•The plant's status (i.e. moving or stationary) has not to be considered by Kim et al. [19], [20], [23] and Son et al. [48], which may lead to error warning. For example, if a plant is not moving, it would be safe if a worker is approaching its area [19], [20], [23], [48];•The installation of a camera on a piece of plant has a limited field view. In particular, a camera is unable to be used in mega projects where multiple pieces of plant may be in operation [48]. As a result, this renders it impossible to detect plant and people who may be nearby simultaneously.
To address the above limitations, we develop a robust and efficient real-time smart video surveillance system to recognize when people enter a hazardous area. In comparison with other image devices (e.g., monocular and UAV), video surveillance can provide a more comprehensive view of sites, and can be used to monitor activities 24-hours a day in real-time. It follows, however, that the larger the area to be monitored, the more video cameras are required, which increases the complexity of computation.
In this paper, we present a novel real-time smart video surveillance system that can be used to detect plant and people automatically and can be used to contribute to preventing accidents on sites actively. We design our real-time smart video surveillance system draws on previous studies that have utilized computer vision and deep learning-based approaches to determine a piece of plant's status, and its proximity to people. To validate the effectiveness and feasibility of our developed real-time smart video surveillance system, we demonstrate its application during the construction of the Rail Transit System in Wuhan, China. We commence our paper by providing a review of the developments in proximity warning approaches. Our proposed research approach and case study are then presented. Next, we discuss our results and identify our studies, limitations. We conclude our paper by summarizing our work and identify avenues for future research.
