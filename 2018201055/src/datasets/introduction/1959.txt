Cancer is a significant health problem in the world nowadays. Every sixth death in the world is due to cancer, making it the second leading cause of death after cardiovascular diseases [1]. Among different types of cancer, brain tumors are considered one of the deadliest forms due to its aggressive nature, heterogeneous characteristics, and low survival rate. Brain tumors can have different types depending on several factors such as the shape, texture, and location of the tumor (e.g., Acoustic Neuroma, Meningioma, Pituitary, Glioma, CNS Lymphoma, etc.) [2]. In clinical practice, the incident rates of Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary tumors are approximately 45%, 15%, and 15%, respectively, among all brain tumors [3]. Depending on tumor type, doctors are able to diagnose and predict patient survival, also they can decide on the appropriate choice of treatment which can range from surgery, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, to a “wait and see” approach which avoids invasive procedures. Hence, tumor grading is an important aspect of treatment planning and monitoring [4].
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a noninvasive, pain-free medical imaging procedure that is used for delivering excellent pictures of the human body organs in 2D and 3D formats. It is widely used and considered to be one of the most accurate techniques for cancer detection and classification, due to its high-resolution images on the brain tissue [5]. However, cancer type recognition based on MRI images is a challenging, error-prone, highly specialized task that depends on the experience of the radiologist, and more importantly, it is a time-consuming procedure. Additionally, tumors may have various shapes and there may not be enough visible landmarks in the image to contribute to an accurate decision. Therefore, we can conclude that human diagnosis is typically unreliable. Moreover, the misdiagnosis of brain tumor type can be a serious issue since it will prevent the effective response to medical intervention and decrease the chance of survival among patients. On the other hand, the correct diagnosis will help the patient start the correct treatment immediately, and live a longer life. Accordingly, this necessitates an urgent need in Artificial Intelligence (AI) field to develop and design a new and innovative Computer Assisted Diagnosis (CAD) system, aiming to relieve the workload of the diagnosis and classification of tumors and act as a helping tool for doctors and radiologists.
Recently, CAD has been an active area of research and development in medical imaging and diagnostic radiology, especially for cancer classification and diagnosis. Typically, a CAD system is consisting of three steps; segmenting the lesions from the image, extracting characteristics of the segmented tumors on basis of statistical or mathematical parameters analysis obtained during the learning process of a set of labeled MRI images, then applying a proper machine learning classifier to predict the class of abnormality [6]. Many traditional machine learning approaches required lesion segmentation prior to the classification step. The process of segmentation is a computationally intensive step, that may be inconsistent depending on the variance in image contrast and intensity normalization, and may affect the performance of the classification [7]. Feature extraction is a crucial procedure used to generate interesting parts – called features – that can describe the contents of a raw image. However, this stage had some negative effects; it is a time-consuming task that requires prior knowledge about the problem domain. Classifying tumor types based on morphological features can easily lead to misclassification because of the similar appearance of various types of tumors. Features are then used as inputs to machine learning classifiers which in turn assign a class label to the image based on those important features [8]. There are several approaches for MRI brain tumor classification using the later-described machine learning approach; such as the work of [6], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Deep learning on the other hand [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], is a subset of machine learning that does not require handcrafted features. Deep learning has been successfully proven to reduce the gap between human vision and computer vision in pattern recognition and can achieve a higher classification performance than conventional machine learning methods [7]. Thus, several works have been adopting deep learning techniques for brain cancer diagnosis [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. The essence of these works is to find the best deep learning model and architecture that optimally classifies brain cancer. However, optimization processes are applied to find the right architectures and hyper-parameters of the model.
This paper proposes an enhanced deep learning model for brain tumor classification from MRI images. The proposed model is trained on a benchmark brain tumor MRI images dataset [37] and is evaluated under several performance metrics. The paper is doing so by extending the work done previously using the Residual Network (ResNet) architecture [38] in order to improve performance. Also, we evaluate the proposed model based on different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and balanced accuracy. By these types of metrics, we can have a clear indicator of the generalization of the model over the imbalanced MRI images dataset. The experimental result shows that the proposed deep learning model is competitive when compared with the other approaches.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes other related work. Section 3 gives a review background on deep learning architecture. Section 4 describes the proposed model. Section 5 introduces the experimental results and the evaluation of the model. Section 6 compares our results with the other published work. Section 7 finally concludes the paper.
