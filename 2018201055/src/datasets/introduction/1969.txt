Privacy preservation has become a necessity for modern applications in social media, cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and healthcare systems. The need to develop robust and efficient methods to keep medical information safe is of paramount importance for modern society. In particular, the security of medical image content has received increasing consideration due to the risk of malicious attacks when transmitted through internet networks or stored in computers. In this context, image encryption plays a pivotal role in preserving the privacy of data content.
Recently, numerous image encryption protocols have been presented [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] and among them we find some protocols that use chaotic systems in order to produce encryption keys. Although there is no unanimous formal definition of a chaotic system, we find that some properties of chaotic systems are being deterministic, sensitive to initial conditions, and exhibiting non-linear behavior [24]. These properties are utilized to create robust encryption keys.
Quantum walks (QWs) constitute an advanced tool for building quantum algorithms that comprise a universal model of quantum computers [25], [26], [27]. Quantum walks are mathematical models of quantum physical systems that are very sensitive to initial conditions; moreover, extracting data out of quantum walks is a probabilistic process described as a nonlinear behavior. Furthermore, quantum walks have properties like stability, non-periodicity, and have unlimited keyspace theoretically to withstand diverse attacks [28]. Consequently, we may think of quantum walks as a chaotic system thus suitable to be used in cryptography [24], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Furthermore, Yang et al. [31] designed a gray-scale image encryption algorithm based on 1-D two-particle QWs. Also, Yang et al. suggested in [32] another a gray-scale image encryption scheme based on controlled 1-D two-particle QWs. Moreover, Abd-El-Atty et al. [24] suggested a quantum image encryption mechanism for gray-scale quantum images based on controlled 1-D one-particle quantum walks.
In this paper, we suggest a new image encryption mechanism based on controlled alternate quantum walks (CAQWs) for preserving the privacy of healthcare images in IoT environments. The enhanced safety level of our proposal is based on the properties of quantum mechanics used for computational and cryptographic purposes as well as on the (very) large size of the set of initial key parameters. Our proposed image encryption algorithm is composed of two phases: substitution and permutation, being both steps based on CAQWs. So, our encryption algorithm has two types of key parameters: the first one is for substitution process and the other is for permutation process. Numerical analysis and simulation results proved that the suggested image encryption mechanism has high efficiency as well as high security.
The layout of this work is as follows. A concise introduction to CAQWs acting on a circle is given in Section 2, and the proposed framework of privacy preserving healthcare for IoT is given in Section 3 while Section 4 presents our image encryption protocol. Corresponding analysis and simulation results are given in Section 5. Conclusions are outlined in Section 6.
