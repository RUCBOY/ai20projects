Over the decades, the explosive increase of noise pollution and ineffectiveness of passive noise control techniques have inspired research in the areas of active noise control (ANC) and nonlinear active noise control (NANC) strategies [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Active noise control applies a principle of superposition. Specifically, combining the acoustic outputs from the primary and secondary noise sources, which have equal amplitudes and opposite phases, leads to cancellation of both noises. The linear adaptive filter using a filtered-x least mean square (FXLMS) algorithm is often used to control both broad-band and narrow-band noises in conventional ANC systems in early years [1], [2], [3], [4]. The linear FXLMS algorithm has effective performance which is dedicated to linear ANC systems. However, in some situations, the ANC systems may exhibit certain nonlinear behaviors. For example, the noise coming from a dynamic system may be nonlinear and deterministic (chaotic rather than a stochastic, or white or tonal noise process); the loudspeakers, fans, and even the primary paths and the secondary paths in the systems may exhibit nonlinear distortion. In these situations, the linear ANC systems could not perform well. Therefore, investigation of using nonlinear adaptive controllers to seek alternatives becomes an active research field.
Till today, many researchers have investigated and applied several nonlinear ANC approaches (see [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]) for tackling various nonlinear effects. They can be mainly classified into two categories: adaptive polynomial filters [8], [9], and neural networks [7], [8], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Based on the adaptive polynomial filters, adaptive Volterra filters using the filtered-x LMS (VFXLMS) algorithm were presented by Tan and Jiang [9], [10]. The VFXLMS algorithm applies all of the possible products of the delayed input signals to construct the nonlinear inputs for a feed-forward controller. The filtered-s LMS (FSLMS) algorithm proposed by Das and Panda [11], [12], gives an alternative to the adaptive polynomial filters. It uses sine and cosine base functions in accordance with the functional-link artificial neural network (FLANN) model to construct the nonlinear inputs. Nevertheless, heavy computational load of VFXLMS and poor approaching ability for cross nonlinearity of FSLMS limit their widely applications.
The bilinear filter as shown in [19], [20], [21] is an attractive model in many practical applications since a large class of nonlinear systems can be adequately and efficiently approximated with a small number of filter coefficients. For this reason, the bilinear filtered-x LMS (BFXLMS) algorithm was reported by Kuo and Wu [19]. To reduce the computational complexity, a simplified bilinear filter with a leaky FXLMS (SBLFXLMS) algorithm was recently presented by Zhao et al. [21]. However, the diagonal-structure feature is not applied in both BFXLMS and SBLFXLMS algorithms. Furthermore, both BFXLMS and SBLFXLMS algorithms overlook the stability problem due to infinite impulse response and bilinear cross term sections in the bilinear model. Hence, both algorithms may diverge due to an inappropriate initial condition or an unstable condition during filter adaptation. Besides the above mentioned approaches, the polynomial nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous variables (NARX) models and model selection techniques have been reported by Napoli and Piroddi [22]. The method is a generalized framework for NANC development and requires significant knowledge on the model selection.
Recently, the diagonal-structure bilinear filtered-x LMS (DBFXLMS) algorithm for a single channel system is carefully derived to preserve the time invariant property of the cross signal vector. The improved performance results are initially reported in [23]. But the algorithm stability control and its extension to a multichannel system such as [21], [24] need to be developed.
In this paper, the DBFXLMS algorithm [23] is extended from a single-channel NANC system to a multichannel NANC system. The developed multichannel DBFXLMS algorithm has a faster convergence speed and more effective control performance in comparison with the second-order VFXLMS, first-order FSLMS, and SBLFXLMS algorithms. Unlike the other bilinear algorithms, the proposed algorithm is equipped with a stability control scheme during filter adaptation. When the adaptive bilinear filter becomes unstable, the stability control scheme can remedy it to be stable in the sense of the bounded input and bounded output.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II extends the single channel DBFXLMS algorithm to the multichannel DBFXLMS algorithm. The comparisons of the computational complexity for the developed algorithms are analyzed in Section III. Section IV presents computer simulations to demonstrate the control performance of the developed multichannel DBFXLMS algorithm for various situations in controlling nonlinear noise processes and a stability control scheme is described. Finally, conclusions are given in Section V.
