In computer experiments, complex systems are increasingly investigated through space-filling designs, which aim to distribute the design points over the design space as evenly as possible. Latin hypercube designs (LHDs), first introduced by McKay et al. (1979), are used as a popular class of space-filling designs. As we know, LHDs achieve one-dimensional space-filling property. One disadvantage of LHDs is that any such design is not necessarily space-filling in the full-dimensional space. To solve this problem, maximin distance criterion (Johnson et al., 1990) was proposed for constructing good LHDs. The maximin distance criterion is to maximize the minimum distance between design points, which guarantees the good space-filling property in the full-dimensional space. The maximin distance designs are asymptotically optimal for fitting Gaussian process models under a Bayesian setting (Johnson et al., 1990), and the maximin distance LHDs are well-suited for computer experiments (Lin and Tang, 2015).
There are many algorithms for constructing maximin distance LHDs, such as the simulated annealing (Morris and Mitchell, 1995, Joseph and Hung, 2008, Ba et al., 2015), swarm optimization algorithms (Moon et al., 2011, Chen et al., 2013) and the threshold-accepting method (Xiao and Xu, 2018). However, due to the computational complexity, these methods are not suitable to construct large LHDs which are needed in computer experiments (see for example, Morris, 1991, Kleijnen, 1997, Cioppa and Lucas, 2007, Gramacy et al., 2015). In order to overcome the challenges for constructing large LHDs, Zhou and Xu (2015) considered linear permutations to construct maximin L1- and L2-distance LHDs based on good lattice point sets; Xiao and Xu (2017) constructed LHDs with large minimum L1-distance via Costas arrays; Wang et al. (2018b) employed the Williams transformation to construct optimal maximin L1-distance LHDs.
The rotation method, firstly presented by Beattie and Lin, 2004, Beattie and Lin, 2005, is simple and useful for constructing designs for computer experiments. This method was further employed to construct orthogonal LHDs, see e.g., Steinberg and Lin (2006), Lin et al. (2009), Pang et al. (2009), Sun and Tang (2017), and Wang et al. (2018a), among others. In this paper, by combining the rotation method and the doubling operator of a design (Chen and Cheng, 2006), we propose several methods to construct maximin L2-distance LHDs without any computer search. Firstly, based on a 22 full factorial design, a class of asymptotically optimal maximin L2-distance LHDs are constructed via the rotation method. Moreover, we show that these LHDs are orthogonal. Next, based on a series of saturated two-level regular designs, a good deal of maximin L2-distance LHDs are constructed via the rotation method. Some of these LHDs are exactly optimal and the others are asymptotically optimal under the maximin L2-distance criterion. Furthermore, the average correlations of these LHDs converge to zero as the design sizes increase, which is desirable for Gaussian process with linear trend (Wang et al., 2018a, Wang et al., 2018b).
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides relevant notation and definitions. Section 3 presents the construction methods, along with some discussions of asymptotic properties for the L2-distance efficiency of the resulting designs. Section 4 discusses several convergence properties of the average correlations for the resulting designs. Section 5 provides some concluding remarks. All proofs are deferred to Appendix.
