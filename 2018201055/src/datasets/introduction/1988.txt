Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are communication systems that translate brain activities into computer commands without making use of peripheral nerve activity or muscles [1,2]. There are many applications such as spelling interfaces [3], [4], [5], playing computer games [6,7] and other assistive devices [8], [9], [10]. And it can provide environmental control capability for several disabled persons to improve life quality [11], [12], [13], [14]. Recently, electroencephalogram (EEG)-based BCIs have achieved rapid progress in performance, functionality and practicality [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. There are several typical EEG paradigms for BCIs, such as: sensorimotor mu/beta rhythms through motor imagine (MI) [16,17], P300 [18,41], and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) [19,26,40,43].
SSVEP-based BCI system has been widely used due to its high information transfer rate (ITR) compared with other EEG paradigms [20,21]. SSVEPs are brain responses elicited by stimulating the retina of the eyeball at a fixed frequency (1–100 Hz) [22]. The distribution of SSVEPs in the spectrum is multiplied by the frequency of visual stimulus. For example, when a 6 Hz fixed modulation frequency stimulates the eyeball, peaks at frequencies of 6 Hz, 12 Hz, and 18 Hz are observed in the spectrum [23].
So far, there are many methods for detecting SSVEPs. Based on the frequency feature of SSVEP signals, power spectrum density analysis (PSDA) through discrete Fourier transform (DFT) was widely used to detect target frequency of SSVEPs from each single channel [24,25]. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is the most popular method to detect SSVEPs tagged with frequency coding. It maximizes the correlation between EEG and sine-cosine reference signals in multi-channel [26]. Many modified CCA-based methods were proposed such as individual template-based CCA (IT-CCA) [27], multi-way CCA (MwayCCA) [28], L1-regularized multi-way CCA [29], and multi-set CCA (MsetCCA) [30], which showed better performance than standard CCA through optimizing the reference signals. In addition, Chen et al. proposed a filter bank canonical correlation analysis (FBCCA) method to incorporate fundamental and harmonic frequency components to improve the detection of SSVEPs [31].
In 2013, Tanaka et al. proposed a new method which can extract task-related components from time-locked near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) data, named task-related component analysis (TRCA) [32]. TRCA can remove artifacts effectively to improve signal to noise ratio. By maximizing the reproducibility of time-locked activities across trials, the TRCA method showed good performance in extracting task-related components. SSVEPs are known as time-locked photic driving responses to repetitive visual stimulus [33,34]. Considering the stability of the latency in SSVEPs, the TRCA-based spatial filtering approach has great potential to improve the SNR of SSVEPs. In a recent study, Nakanishi et al. applied TRCA as a spatial filter to improve the SNR of SSVEPs, and the TRCA-based approach showed better performance than CCA [35].
Despite many examples of impressive progress to classify SSVEPs [36], [37], [38], there is still room for considerable improvement with respect to the accuracy. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) is one of the largest advances in machine learning. CNNs allow automatic feature extraction within their layers, which means learning feature by itself instead of manually designing features. Moreover, SSVEPs has much abundant inner information. CNNs have advantages in dealing with this internal information compared with traditional methods. There are some advantages that traditional technology does not have: good fault tolerance, self-learning ability, good adaptive performance and high resolution. CNNs have better generalization than other methods. Thus, CNN has been used for decoding brain signals in some recent studies. In [37], Cecotti proposed a CNN architecture, which simulates FFT process, to classify time domain SSVEP signals. In 2017, Kwak et al. proposed a classifier based deep CNN that used frequency features as input for robust SSVEP detection and found highly encouraging SSVEP decoding results for the CNN architecture [39].
In this study, we aim to use deep learning methods to improve classification performance of SSVEPs. We combined advantages of deep learning and CCA and proposed a CNN-based comparing network to identify the target of SSVEPs. We designed templates to represent the prior information of the SSVEPs, such as SSVEP frequency, personal EEG pattern and so on. For our proposed network, these templates and SSVEP samples are the two kinds of inputs. Compared with [37], we use the frequency domain signal as the SSVEP input of the network. The feature extraction process begins with the frequency domain signal, so that our network can extract deeper feature of SSVEPs than the frequency domain features. Moreover, the network can learn the relationship between the SSVEP sample and template designed according to the prior information. Then, it solves the classification task of SSVEPs according to the relationship. Compared with other CNN methods [36–39], that the comparing network learns is the relationship between SSVEP sample and templates rather than the frequency feature of SSVEP.
Furthermore, we developed three different kinds of templates to build the comparing network. Each kind of template has four classes corresponding to each class of SSVEP. The effectiveness of the proposed comparing network was validated by comparing it with the traditional method CCA and a CNN-based method [39]. We proposed three kinds of templates, sinusoidal signal template, individual average template and TRCA (task-related component analysis) template, for the comparing networks. And comparison among three kinds of templates was taken to evaluate the performance of different kinds of templates. The performance was evaluated using a four-target SSVEP dataset recorded from twenty-three subjects.
