Cryptography has been used for thousand years with the primary goal of allowing a sender to send a message to a receiver through an insecure channel, in which any outsider deliberately or accidentally sees the message but cannot understand the real content inside the message. At the beginning, it is sufficient to consider the problem of securely sending a message from one user to only one receiver. However, modern applications require that a message be sent securely to multiple receivers (called target set). For example, in file sharing, one wants to securely share a file to many users; in encrypted mail system, one wants to securely send an email to many receivers; in social network, one wants to privately send a message to a group, in Pay-TV systems the center wants to broadcast a channel to a set of subscribers, etc.
Broadcast encryption cryptography has increasingly become more and more important, to meet the complexity and practical needs for securely transmitting information.
Multi-Channel Broadcast Encryption and Attribute-Based Encryption. When a sender wants to send different messages to different target sets at the same time, for example in pay-TV systems providers have to send different contents to different groups of users (channels), a simple and natural solution is to apply repeatedly a broadcast encryption scheme of choice. However, this method requires huge computation time and communication cost. For example, if one uses a broadcast encryption scheme with constant-size header to send m different messages to m distinct target sets at the same time, the header size is linear in m. Multi-Channel Broadcast Encryption (MCBE in short) was introduced by Canard el al. [17] to deal with this problem. In a MCBE scheme, we expect that a sender can efficiently send different messages to different target sets at the same time.
Sahai and Waters [44] introduced the notion of attribute-based encryption (ABE in short), which is a generalization of public-key encryption to support fine-grained access control for encrypted data. ABE is separated in two categories: ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) and key-policy attribute-based encryption (KP-ABE), where in a CP-ABE scheme each user possesses a set of attributes and is provided with a secret key corresponding to this attributes set, while the ciphertext is constructed from an access policy (structure) over a universe of attributes. A user can decrypt the ciphertext if and only if his/her set of attributes satisfy the access policy. In contrast, KP-ABE is the dual of CP-ABE with ciphertexts associated with attributes and keys with access policies. After the work of Sahai and Waters, a lot of ABE schemes have been proposed to investigate various properties for an ABE scheme such as access policy, header size, secret key size, computation time, security, decentralization, etc. In practice, we often would like to have ABE schemes with constant size header and fined-grain access policy such as DNF (i.e., with disjunctions (OR) of conjunctions (AND) of attributes) or CNF (i.e., with conjunctions (AND) of disjunctions (OR) of attributes) form.
In [17] the authors introduced a new technique to build both MCBE and ABE schemes with constant size header. However, their schemes have limited applications in practice due to the weakness that their schemes are in secret-key setting (only authority can send messages).
1.1. Related workBroadcast encryption has been extensively investigated in recent years, we recommend [24], [38], [22], [12], [13], [21], [26], [46], [34], [40], [39], [14], [45], [3], [2], [4], to name a few. These papers use different techniques and consider a variety of situations for broadcasting a message to an arbitrarily chosen target set. Some main directions of broadcast encryption to research such as public-key CCA-security [22], [12], fully collusion-resistant of malicious users [12], [39], [14], adaptive security [26], [46], [34], [3], identity-based broadcast encryption [21], [45] and tracing traitors [38], [13], [4].Multi-channel broadcast encryption was introduced by Canard el al. [17], which is a generalization of broadcast encryption, where a sender can send different messages to different target sets at the same time. However, these schemes suffer a weakness that they are in secret-key setting. Later, in [50] the authors made use of the cover free family technique to improve the public-key size of Phan el al.'s schemes. Very recently, Acharya and Dutta [1] used a different technique to propose a MCBE scheme in the public key setting.Attribute-based encryption. Attribute-based encryption in another area of active research, see for example [44], [28], [23], [30], [47], [19], [9], [25], [31], [43], [18], [49], [15], [36], [33], [37]. ABE scheme supporting fine-grained access control was first proposed in [28], extending work of Sahai and Waters's work [44]. They use the tree structure technique to propose a scheme supporting fine-grained access control, specified by a boolean formula. Subsequent works in this direction such as [47], [31], [43], [18], [49], [48], [20] support linear secret sharing (LSS) access policy, [32], [41], [36], [16] support DNF access policy, [32], [17] support CNF access policy, [27], [15] support general access policy.Regarding CP-ABE schemes with constant size header [23], [30], [19], [25], [18], [42], [8], [6], [5], [17], many authors proposed CP-ABE schemes with constant size header but with limited access structures. More precisely, in [23], [19], [42], the access structure is constructed by AND-gates on multi-valued attributes while in [30], [25], [18], the access policy is threshold. In a slightly different direction, the authors of [8], making use of the conversion technique between ABE and spatial encryption [29], proposed CP-ABE schemes which support LSS access policy. Interestingly, in [6], [5], making use of the pair encoding technique [7], [48], some CP-ABE schemes are proposed which also support LSS access policy. However, key size in the above schemes is quite problematic. In [17], the authors made use of the technique in [32] to give a transition from a multi-channel broadcast encryption scheme to a CP-ABE scheme with constant size header and supports CNF access policy. The resulting scheme has better key size than those proposed in [8], [6], [5], however it is still in the secret-key setting. We note that the schemes in [8], [6], [5] can achieve full security in the standard model, while the schemes in [17] only achieve selective security in the generic group model.
1.2. Our contributionsIn this paper, we propose a new technique for compacting header size in both MCBE and ABE schemes. Compare to the Canard el al.'s technique which leads to MCBE and ABE schemes in the secret key setting, our technique leads to schemes in the public key setting. More precisely, our MCBE scheme has the following properties:•it is a MCBE scheme in the public key setting;•it supports fast decryption. User just needs to compute two pairings for decryption, we show concrete benchmarks in the Table 3;•it has constant-size header, independent of the number of channels, while the user's secret key size is exactly the number of the channels that a user has subscribed to;•it achieves selective security in the random oracle model.We also extend our MCBE scheme to the context of ABE to obtain a new CP-ABE scheme. Our CP-ABE scheme has better key size than the schemes proposed in [8], [6], [5], and still in the public-key setting. However, our scheme only achieves selective security in the generic group model. More precisely, our CP-ABE scheme has the following properties:•it supports CNF access policy;•it has the constant size header, and user's secret key size is linear in N where N is the product of number of attributes and number of clauses in CNF access policy;•user needs to compute 2m pairings for decryption, m is the number of clauses in CNF access policy. We show concrete benchmarks in the Table 4;•it achieves selective security in the generic group model.We give in the Table 1 the comparison among our MCBE scheme and some other existing MCBE schemes, in the Table 2 the comparison among our CP-ABE scheme and some other existing CP-ABE schemes which also achieve constant size header.Table 1. n is the maximum number of subscribers in one channel, m is the maximum number of channels, P denotes pairing computation, ROM: random oracle model. |G| denotes the size of an element in group G, |G˜| denotes the size of an element in group G˜.HeaderS-keyP-keyDec timeSecuritySetting[17]-12|G|m|G˜|3mn|G|+2mn|G˜|(m + 1)PSelectiveSecret-key[17]-23|G|+1|G˜|m|G˜|2mn|G|+2mn|G˜|(m + 2)PSelective-CCA + ROMSecret-key[50]2|G|m|G˜|2mn|G|+2mn|G˜|(m + 1)PSelectiveSecret-key[1]2|G|m|G|(mn+m)|G|2PSelectivePublic-keyOur MCBE1|G|+1|G˜|m|G|m2n|G˜|2PSelective + ROMPublic-keyTable 2. n is the maximum number of attributes in the system, m is the maximum number of clauses in the CNF access policy, k is the maximum size of an attribute set associated with a secret key, ℓ denotes the maximum number of rows of a span program matrix associated with a ciphertext, fixed at the setup, thus should be n.
