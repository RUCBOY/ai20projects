Digital library (DL) is of increasing significance in recent years, becoming a platform for easy access to electronic resources for a wide community of users. In recent times, Nigerian universities have embarked on integration of technologies in their operations for improvement and development, especially in the aspect of digitisation, dissemination and preservation of academic information resources. The universities libraries are fully involved in this development as they are the heart of the universities where intellectual contents of the institutions are housed. Also as part of mandatory requirements of the Nigeria National Universities Commission, various university libraries in Nigeria have complied and subscribed to DL initiative as a way of complementing and providing access to unlimited data and information resources; hence, DL is a gateway to access electronic resources in many Nigerian universities.
While an enormous amount of resources is spent in building DLs, increasing user access is essential to justify the resources invested. However, with the huge investment committed to establishment of DLs in Nigerian universities, review of literature reveal that less research has been done on its acceptance and use by students in Nigerian universities. There is need for research to know about patronage of these libraries and be able to conclude if the resources committed are justifiable. It is also important to determine if students are really familiar with DL services, whether students are making effective use of the libraries, and whether the technology provides a good fit with students' tasks. This study was, therefore, conceived to investigate usage of DL among undergraduates in some selected Nigerian universities and also determine the fit of the technology with the students' tasks. The study also identified the factors that influence use of DLs by the students.
