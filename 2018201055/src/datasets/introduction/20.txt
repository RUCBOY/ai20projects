Fractured rocks store vast amounts of hydrocarbon resources; however, their complex structure and the presence of granular pores present a unique challenge to the energy industry. The importance of these rocks is not limited to the petroleum industry but extends to groundwater resources, renewable sources of energy such as geothermal energy and CO2 geo-sequestration (Finkbeiner et al., 2019). Two of the most important lithologies encountered for the above are sandstones and carbonates (Barker et al., 1988; Cooke et al., 2006; Jenkins et al., 2009; Olson et al., 2009; Ouenes, 2000; Ozkaya and Richard, 2006). To reliably store and extract energy from these sources, it is important to characterize granular pores and fractures accurately and model fluid flow in such a complex medium (Blunt, 2001; Blunt et al., 2013; Sahimi, 2011). This paper will carry out a novel pore-scale structural analysis for fractured porous media by applying a computer vision and unsupervised machine learning framework.
Characterizing and modelling flow in fractured rocks presents a unique challenge because both fractures and granular pores have significant differences in their geometries and conductivity characteristics (Blunt, 2001; Blunt et al., 2013; Sahimi, 2011; Jing et al., 2017; Su et al., 2015). Fractures are considered planar structures with rough walls (Adler et al., 2013; Mostaghimi et al., 2017; Sahimi, 2011). Their geometry differs in various ways from pores: (1) fractures are elongated structures, (2) they have an orientation, (3) their width is much lower than their length, and (4) their length can reach the domain size of the investigated porous medium (Berre et al., 2019). These differences in the geometries profoundly affect the flow simulations (Mostaghimi et al., 2015). In the context of a pore-scale flow, fractures improve connectivity and hence, significantly increase the permeability of the porous medium (Adler et al., 2013). However, this also means that competing fluid flow processes occur in a porous medium through both fractures and granular pores. In addition to quantifying this physical effect, pore network extraction for fast computation of permeabilities requires a distinction between pores and fractures so that appropriate extraction techniques such as maximum ball and the medial surface algorithm can be applied (Jiang et al., 2017). Jing et al. (2020) have recently developed a pipe-network model to address the issues regarding the extraction of PNMs for fractured media.
Information regarding pores, fractures, and mineral phases of rock samples can be obtained from high-resolution micro-CT tomography based on variations in the grey-level intensities (Cnudde and Boone, 2013; Iassonov et al., 2009; Leu et al., 2014 ; Li et al., 2017; Mostaghimi et al., 2017; Schlüter et al., 2014; Wildenschild and Sheppard, 2013). Low grey-level intensities represent the low-density pores and kaolinites, whereas the high-density minerals phases such as quartz, ankerite, and zircon are represented by high grey-level intensities (Singh et al., 2019). These differences in variation can be captured in frequency-based grey-level histograms (Cnudde and Boone, 2013; Iassonov et al., 2009; Mostaghimi et al., 2017; Schlüter et al., 2014; Wildenschild and Sheppard, 2013) or second-order statistical maps (Singh et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2020). As a common practice, the original micro-CT images or greyscale images are segmented by thresholding techniques such as Otsu thresholding, Watershed segmentation, or Converging active contours (Cnudde and Boone, 2013; Iassonov et al., 2009; Rezaei et al., 2019; Schlüter et al., 2014; Wildenschild and Sheppard, 2013).
For a system composed of either fractures or granular pores, the segmentation technique provides a means to segregate pores and mineral phases such that the fluid flow approximations can be applied directly to the pore phase for accurate permeability estimations (Chung et al., 2019; Elkhoury et al., 2019; Rabbani et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). However, for complex fractured porous media, where there are both fractured and granular pore spaces, there is no such distinction based on pore-geometry type.
Thresholding using grey-level intensities does not provide a direct method to segregate fractures and granular pores in a micro-CT image. An in-depth structural and shape analysis of the pore-space is required to differentiate pore structures. Computer vision can assist in this process by using the contour detection method (Duda et al., 2012; Horaud and Brady, 1988; Loncaric, 1998; Nabizadeh and Kubat, 2017; Pavlidis, 1980). Different shape descriptors have been then applied to contours for further analysis (Celebi and Aslandogan, 2005). These shape descriptors include Fourier descriptors (Chun-peng et al., 2016; Folkers and Samet, 2002; Iwata and Ukai, 2002; Persoon and Fu, 1977) and image moments such as raw or spatial moments, central moments, and Hu-moments (Flusser et al., 1996; Kotoulas and Andreadis, 2005; Teh and Chin, 1988). While computer vision provides a means to calculate granular pores and fractures' structural properties, an additional method to segregate these into different classes is necessary. For this task, machine learning can be used.
In recent times, both supervised and unsupervised machine learning have been extensively used in porous media applications (Tahmasebi et al., 2020). These applications include predicting porous media properties (Alqahtani et al., 2020; Kamrava et al., 2020; Rabbani et al., 2020; Santos et al., 2020; Sudakov et al., 2019; Yesiloglu-Gultekin et al., 2013), segmenting grayscale rock images (Niu et al., 2020), reconstructing 3D porous media (Mosser et al., 2017), providing super-resolution rock images from low-resolution images (Wang et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2020), classification of rocks based on petrophysical properties (da Silva et al., 2015), identifying sweet spots in shale reservoirs (Tahmasebi et al., 2017) and characterizing flow regimes in core-flooding data (Ni and Benson, 2020). Despite its extensive use in the domain of rock micro-CT images, machine learning techniques have not yet been employed to differentiate granular pores from fractures using the structural properties obtained via computer vision algorithms.
This paper presents a novel application of contour detection, a computer vision-based technique coupled with K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to distinguish between fractures and granular pores in a 3D segmented image. We use experimentally induced and digitally induced fractured samples of sandstone and carbonate in this study. The paper starts by describing granular pore and fracture geometries as contours with 20 unique structural properties. These properties are subsequently analysed using the principal component analysis to transform and reduce the high-dimensionality feature space. This is followed by a K-means clustering-based identification and segregation of contours into two main classes: fractures and granular pores. The results of the clustering analysis are then compared against ground truth images to estimate the accuracy and reliability of the proposed clustering workflow.
