Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious global public health problem [1,2]. HBV is infectious and the most common cause of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis andhepatocellular carcinoma [3,4]. HBV can be easily transmitted from one infected person to another by blood to blood contact, mother to child, unsafe sexual intercourse, common use of feeding utensils and other barber shop and beauty salon materials [5]. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection widely varies across the world (0.5–20%), due to variations in age at the time of infection and mode of acquisition [1]. There is anestimated 257 million people living with CHB in the world [6]. Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa bear most of the burden of CHB, accounting for more than three quarters of the people with CHB in the world [7].
Ethiopia is one part of the world where the burden of HBV infection is considered to be high [8]. A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted in Ethiopia showed that the overall pooled prevalence of HBV infection is 7.4%. In addition its pooled prevalence among subgroups also showed that 5.2% in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals, 8.0% in community based studies, 8.4% in blood donors, 11.0% in immigrants and 6.9% in other groups [9]. An old clinical study done in our country showed that liver disease accounted for 12% hospital admissions and 31% hospital mortality [10]. In addition, in Ethiopia and neighbouring Kenya greater than 60% of chronic liver disease and up to 80% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are due to chronic HBV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections [10,11]. This suggests that HBV is still a significant public health problem in the country which requires greater attention.
The prevalence rate of HBV in health care workers (HCWs) is about 2–10 times higher than the general populations in the world [12,13]. In context of HCWs, the risk factors for HBV infection are percutaneous or mucosal exposure to infected blood or body fluids, using inadequately sterilized medical equipment or contact with non-intact skin [12]. Apart from the HCWs, trainees in the health care professions are also exposed to an equal magnitude of occupational risk of HBV, as they work in the same health care delivery system. In fact, the risk for accidental exposure among the trainees could be greater due to their lack of experience, inadequate training, workload, and tiredness [14,15].
HBV infection can be prevented by adhering to universal precautions including the use of protective barriers like gloves, proper sterilization of medical equipment, proper hospital wastes management system and vaccination [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. Moreover, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can be used as a means of HBV prevention after accidental exposure to contaminated blood or body fluids [16,17,19]. However, studies have indicated that there is a clear gap of knowledge among trainees of health profession towards the risks of occupational exposure to HBV infection [20,21]. In Ethiopia, data is deficient regarding knowledge and practice towards the occupational exposure to HBV infectionamong the students of health care professions, increasing the high prevalence of the infection in the general population [5,22,23]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and practices of the students of medicine and health sciences towards HBV in central Ethiopia.
