The loss of motor function can affect a person’s quality of life significantly [1], [2], [3], [4] by leaving them partially or even completely dependent on others [5]. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, released in 2007 by the United Nations Development Program and signed by over 150 countries, highlighted the importance of improving research, development and the availability of Assistive Technology (AT). AT is defined as any product or device that is used to improve functioning for someone who has a disability [6], [7] in order to improve the participation of people with disabilities in full and productive lives [6]. In the efforts and actions toward making the World better place to live, the WHO Global Disability action plan 2014–2021 [8] is an important step towards achieving health and well-being and human rights for people with disabilities.
With the penetration of computers and Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in almost all aspects of human lives, many problems regarding interaction with ICT emerged for persons with motor impairments. AT for ICT attempts to solve these problems. In order to lead full and productive lives, people with disabilities need to have the same access to ICT as people without disabilities [9]. The best effect of an AT for ICT comes when it is developed with and tested by the potential end users. The incentive of our work was, therefore, to engage severely motor-impaired users in testing and evaluating the proposed HCI solution.
Standard computer interfaces (e.g. mouse, keyboard), which require muscle movements during the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), are mostly not suitable for users with severe motor disabilities [10]. A wide range of AT products have been developed in order to improve access to ICT by enabling HCI for people with motor disabilities [11], [12]. Some examples of a wide range of AT for people with motor disabilities are mechanical switches, proximity sensors, adapted joysticks, voice recognition solutions, head-trackers, eye-trackers, electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG) and electroencephalography (EEG) interfaces [13].
The main objective of this study was to evaluate a solution for hands-free interaction with computers for motor-impaired users. The solution is based on the Emotiv EPOC+ device [14], hereinafter EPOC+. EPOC+ enables the measuring and combining of EEG and EMG signals, as well as data from motion sensors. Facial expressions – muscle artefacts, which commonly get rejected in laboratory EEG studies – are diverted and classified, to map the activation in different muscle groups and eye movement events [15]. By measuring and analyzing EMG signals, facial expressions can be identified, which, in turn, can be used for the implementation of computer commands.
In existing research, EPOC+ was used and evaluated for various solutions, e.g. synthesized speech communication [16], affective command-based control systems [17], motor imagery application [18], robot controlling [19], cognitive assessment through various stimulus modalities and gaming events [20], analysis of how cognitive skills are affected by playing videogames [21], etc. A recognized weakness of these studies is that studies involved mostly only healthy participants in the experiments, with the exception of [16], in which 5 patients with motor disabilities participated. A wider scope of research with regard to Brain Computer Interface (BCI) solutions based on various BCI devices and technology yields the same observation. Several studies in this field deal with the design and research of solutions which can help patients with different impairments in rehabilitation and daily life activities. The number of patients who have participated in the reported studies varies. For example, there were: 3 subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) [22], 3 subjects with (ALS) and 3 with Primary Lateral Sclerosis (PLS) [4], 5 tetraplegic subjects [23], and 5 disabled subjects [24]. Furthermore, very rarely do studies in this field involve both non-disabled as well as disabled users (as is the case, for example, in [22], [23], [24]). Consequently, there is an existing gap between active research in the HCI field and application of HCI solutions for potential end users in their home environment [25]. Therefore, this study is one of first attempts to investigate the benefits and drawbacks of a solution for touchless interaction with a computer based on the EPOC+ involving motor-impaired users in their home environment.
The second objective of the study was grounded in insight, that in innovative HCI research, researchers are more often focused on design and implementation and less on how end users react to such solutions. Consequently, the HCI domain lacks a satisfactory explanation of user perspectives on innovative technologies. The success of innovative Information Technology (IT) requires attention on the early adopters of technology and enthusiasts, rather than on general end-users of technology, which is why user acceptance must be considered [26]. This study aimed to investigate users’ perceptions related to acceptance and use of the introduced HCI solution, especially to understand the differences in perceptions between users who do not need such innovative HCI solution, and perceptions from users who can benefit from the proposed solution.
