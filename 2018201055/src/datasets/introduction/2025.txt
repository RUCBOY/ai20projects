Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field of inquiry that studies the interaction between humans and computers in all forms, and is particularly engaged with understanding the relationship between humans and emerging technology. The field is an interdiscipline (Blackwell, 2015a; Kim, 1990; Reeves, 2015a), originating in work on human factors in computer systems in the 1970′s, that today uses diverse methods and practice from Computer Science, Psychology, Sociology, Design and the Arts. Oulasvirta and Hornbæk (2016) characterise HCI as “a problem-solving field” that places “real and strong emphasis on constructive problems”, in that contributions are often valued based on how proposed solutions address challenges created by different kinds of computer systems, interactions and contexts.
Concerning wisdom, HCI is a field in reflection (Blackwell, 2015b; Clemmensen, 2006; Crabtree, Rodden, Tolmie, & Button, 2009; Hornbæk, 2015; Kostakos, 2015; Reeves, 2015b; Whittaker, Terveen, & Nardi, 2000). As the complexity and ubiquity of technology plays a key role in our lives, how can the field agree on what is responsible and wise? Sternberg (2016) notes “the mismatch between the development of technology and the lack of development of wisdom places the world at enormous risk”. Ongoing economic, social and political controversies entangled with modern computer technologies (Carr, 2011; Lanier, 2014; Morozov, 2012; Turkle, 2017; Zittrain, 2008) demonstrate the validity of this concern, as does the close relationship between HCI and corporate tech giants as collaborators, contributors and sponsors. Computing and wisdom is an ongoing concern, for example in 1976, Joseph Weizenbaum’s acclaimed and controversial book “Computing power and human reason: From judgement to calculation” (Weizenbaum, 1976) gave voice to his concerns about the possibly negative effects of computing, including its close ties to the military. He makes his case most strongly in the book’s final chapter, “Against the imperialism of instrumental reason”, where he forcefully argues that computers should never be allowed to make important decision due to their lack of essential human qualities such as empathy, compassion and wisdom.
