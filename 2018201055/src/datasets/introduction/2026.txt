In the mid-1980s, the study of the optical computer entered a period of prosperity. Along with the continuous progress of optical fiber technology, laser technology and semiconductor technology, the research of the optical computer also produces some new ideas. According to the different emphasis of the study and the different use of materials, the study of the optical computers can be divided into the following categories: Optical computer based on symbolic substitution [[1], [2], [3], [4]], optical logic device based on semiconductor optical amplifier [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]] and optical multi stable materials based on bacteriorhodopsin [[11], [12], [13], [14]].
During the research of optical computing, scholars found that the characteristics of polarization of light can be used to express information. In 2000, Y. Jin et al. proposed the concept of the ternary optical computer and designed its structure [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. In 2014, the first TOC, ShangDa-11 (for short SD11, means: Shanghai University 2011), is built by Shanghai University, China. TOC is one of various new type computers. From the application point of view, a ternary optical processor (TOP) has up to thousands of data bits. Each data bit can be assigned to a single task independently and reconfigured in real-time according to users’ demands during running time. Traditional computers do not have these advantages. As a result, a TOC will be more efficient than several traditional computers when calculating large quantities of data. With the advent of SD11, the applications of TOC have become into a focus of attention, so a method of writing applications program of the TOC must be set as fast as possible.
At the very start, we notice the fact that all of current program language are defective on data bits grouping and reconfiguring the processor, so the TOC program cannot been produced in those language such as C, C++, JAVE, MPI and so on. Considering the application should not only make full use of the advantages of TOC but also keep users’ programming habits as much as possible, we adopted a strategy to build the TOC programming platform. The strategy is to generate a special file, which including the computation rules and a lot of original data, we called Computation-Data File. For having a file name extension. SZG, the Computation-Data File is called SZG file too. The SZG file is the only way for programmer to express the needs for grouping data bits and reconfiguring the processor hardware, so the SZG file is the core of writing TOC application program. Because the SZG file conceals all of the differences between TOC and electronic computers in the application, programmers can easily use efficient parallel computing methods provided by the TOC and keep the traditional programming concepts, habits and techniques. As a result, a work model in which the TOC works cooperatively with the electronic computer in one application was built.
