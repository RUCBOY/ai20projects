One indication of the increasing impact of science and technology on education is the rapid development of augmented reality (AR) applications. AR is a technology which uses real-world camera images and virtual objects placed at specific points, simultaneously providing for interactions and interpretations through the resulting programs (Azuma, 1997; Kye & Kim, 2008). In an AR application, the real environment is not directly encroached upon: it is an interaction between real world and virtual objects (Erbas & Demirer, 2014). According to the Horizon reports published each year, AR Technology is likely to have a considerable influence on education in the foreseeable future (Cai, Wang, & Chiang, 2014). This was also highlighted in a report published in 2012 which stated that the use of AR in education can make a significant impact during the next 4–5 years. Similarly, others have stated that AR has the potential to effect a transformation in education (Johnson, Adams & Cummins, 2012).
In recent years, AR technology has come to the fore in areas such as mathematics and science, since it enhances students' activity and takes them into an individual learning environment. The combining of virtual and real objects, providing real-time interaction, and presenting 3D objects which are important features of AR technology, results in a different learning experience in which the sense of reality is created (Azuma, 1997; Moreno, MacIntyre & Bolter, 2001). In this way, a permanent learning environment is created which makes the information concrete (Walczak, Wojciechowski & Cellary, 2006). Other benefits of AR technology highlighted in research studies include: the opportunity for experiences which are not available to people in real life (Wojciechowski & Cellary, 2013; Wu, Lee, Chang, & Liang, 2013); increased student participation (Wojciechowski & Cellary, 2013); learning by entertaining (Yoon, Elinich, Wang, Steinmeier & Tucker, 2012); saving time and space (Li, 2010; Ab Aziz, Ab Aziz, Paul, Yusof, & Noor, 2012); raising motivation and attention levels (Ab Aziz et al., 2012; O'Brien & Toms, 2005; Sumadio & Rambli, 2010) and increasing cooperation (Billinghurst, 2002; Yuen, Yaoyuneyong & Johnson, 2011). Another factor is that AR supports approaches such as constructivism, learning by doing, and authentic learning, which serve to make students active in the learning environment (Yilmaz & Goktas, 2017; Kirner, Reis & Kirner, 2012; Wojciechowski & Cellary, 2013; Yuen et al., 2011).
Science is an area of education where AR technology is particularly prominent. Students often have difficulty in learning science subjects because of the abstract concepts they contain (Palmer, 1999). Science lessons enriched with technologies which include visuals for the teaching of phenomena that cannot be easily examined in the class are more effective than traditional science lessons. As a result, students' interest in science is increasing and concrete knowledge of the field of science is provided (Rehmat & Bailey, 2014). Furthermore, simultaneous use of virtual objects and real environments in AR technology makes it easier for students to understand complex abstract concepts (Arvanitis et al., 2009). AR technology, by enabling three-dimensional representation of invisible and difficult-to-visualize events, facilitates the realization of topics and provides an understanding of subjects that students normally find difficult (Wu et al., 2013).
When the literature on AR applications in science education is examined, a number of educational benefits are claimed, such as: positively affecting the attitudes of the students (Cai, Chiang, & Wang, 2013; Sumadio & Rambli, 2010); increasing students' motivation in the lesson (Cai et al., 2013; Sumadio & Rambli, 2010; Wojciechowski & Cellary, 2013); presenting an effective and efficient learning environment (Iordache, Pribeanu, & Balog, 2012) and ensuring the course is fun and achieving the active participation of students (Wojciechowski & Cellary, 2013; Yoon et al., 2012). Other advantages include: providing a sense of reality when learning a subject (Lin & Wang, 2012); providing students with a natural experience in the learning environment (Sumadio & Rambli, 2010) and facilitating learning (Shelton & Stevens, 2004). When comparing the benefits of AR technology in general use in all areas of education and the benefits of its use specifically in science education, it can be seen that many benefits are shared. These are: enhancing students' activity, providing a sense of reality, learning by entertaining, raising motivation and providing an efficient learning environment. This situation reflects the value of using AR technology in science education. For this paper, 62 articles indexed over the last six years in the Web of Science are summarized in Table 1.Table 1.

This study focuses on uses of AR in science education articles published between 2013 and 2018. These articles have been analyzed in terms of examined variables, used material types for AR, method trends, data collection tools, sampling methods, sample populations, sample sizes and data analysis methods. In addition, a bibliometric mapping analysis was conducted in respect of the most-used keywords, words in abstracts and the most-cited authors and journals in published articles to date. Within the scope of the study, the form of the data collection tool is the determining factor for the handling of the variables examined in content analysis. When trend studies in the literature are considered, it can be seen that the variables examined are similar to those in this study (Akçayır & Akçayır, 2017; Bacca et al., 2014; Baydas, Kucuk, Yilmaz, Aydemir, & Goktas, 2015; Goksu, Ozcan, Cakir, & Goktas, 2017; Goktas et al., 2012; Hwang & Tsai, 2011; Kucuk, Aydemir, Yildirim, Arpacik & Goktas, 2013; Solak & Erdem, 2015; Wu et al., 2012). In addition to the content analysis, the number of variables was increased by the bibliometric mapping analysis. All articles published on the use of AR in science education up to 2019 were examined, and a general evaluation presented. The variables in the bibliometric mapping analysis were limited to the analysis provided by the VOSViewer program. The aim of this study was to reveal any missing or necessary factors by examining methodological research trends over the last six years and the bibliometric mapping analysis results of all related published articles. Through this comprehensive content and bibliometric mapping analysis, it is hoped that our findings will provide a valuable contribution to researchers studying AR applications in science education. It is hoped that this work will prove to be a useful resource for researchers in this field in future.
