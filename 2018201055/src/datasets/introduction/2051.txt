Acetabular fracture is a serious intra-articular fracture of a weight-bearing joint, and anatomic reduction and strong internal fixation is its eternal pursuit [1], [2]. However, because of the complex local anatomy of the pelvis and close-set neurovascular structure, acetabular fracture surgery has always been very challenging.
Because the osseous morphological structure of the pelvis is extremely complex, orthopedic surgeons often found it difficult to conceptualize the various fracture patterns and shape the plates during an acetabular operation [3]. Especially for the inexperienced surgeons, it may take a long time to bend the plates repeatedly, which would decrease the strength of the plates or lead to re-displacement of fractures because of unsatisfactory contouring, ultimately resulting in a high risk of surgical complications and unsatisfactory clinical outcomes [4], [5].
With the rapid development of computed tomography (CT) imaging technology and digital orthopedic surgery methods, computer-aided design (CAD) and rapid prototyping (RP) technology have been widely used in clinical practice [2], [6], [7]. In order to solve the above problems, many studies have reported the application of computer-assisted virtual surgery procedure and three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, which finally obtained good clinical outcomes in acetabular fracture surgeries [2], [3], [8], [9].
However, there are still rare studies comparing CAD and RP techniques for patient-specific pre-contoured plate and the conventional method of intraoperative contouring of the reconstruction plate. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis on the clinical data of 52 patients with complex acetabular fractures involving two columns over the past 4 years from January 2013 to January 2017, comparing CAD and RP techniques for patient-specific pre-contoured plate and the conventional method in terms of surgery index, reduction quality, and hip function.
