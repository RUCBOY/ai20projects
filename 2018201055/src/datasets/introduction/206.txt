In recent years, digital watermarking techniques have been widely studied because of their efficiency in the copyright protection of 3D models [1], [2]. Various strategies have been proposed to achieve the optimal trade-off between the transparency and robustness of watermarks. These strategies can be broadly classified into non-blind and blind types, based on whether the watermark-extraction process requires the original models. Non-blind watermarking methods [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] demonstrate robust resistance to various attacks while guaranteeing good imperceptibility. The shortcoming of the non-blind watermarking method is that the process of extracting the watermark requires the original model, thereby limiting the applications of the method. In contrast, the blind watermarking method [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] is quite practical and has attracted the attention of many scholars. According to the difference of the embedding domain, the 3D watermarking methods are classified as spatial domain and transform domain methods. The spatial domain method [3], [4], [5], [7], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [16], [19], [20], [21], [23], [27] embeds the watermarking information in the 3D model by directly changing the parameters, including the coordinates and the normal vector of the model. This kind of watermarking method is fragile. The frequency domain method [6], [8], [9], [18], [22], [26] on the other hand, first converts the 3D model into a transform domain and then modifies the transform coefficients to embed the watermarking information. This kind of watermarking method is durable.
The watermarking methods for 3D models, mentioned hither to, involve embedding the watermark in the 3D models by modifying either the geometric properties or the topological structure in the spatial domain, or the transform coefficients in the frequency domain. However, these watermarking methods may produce certain deformations. Although these methods avoid creating any perceptible distortions in the models and ensure the imperceptibility of the watermarks, they inevitably weaken the robustness of the watermark.
A zero-watermarking method can effectively coordinate the imperceptibility and the robustness of a watermark. The zero-watermarking method exploits the geometric features of the model to construct the watermarking information which denotes the copyright rather than embedding the watermarking information in the data of the model. The constructed watermarking information needs to be registered in the intellectual property rights (IPR) database together with the timestamp. When the copyright of the protected model needs to be verified, the watermark obtained by the aforementioned method needs to be matched with all the watermarks registered in the IPR database, thus verifying whether the protected model carries the constructed watermark. The main difference between the zero-watermarking method and the traditional watermarking methods is that unlike the traditional watermarking methods, in zero-watermarking method the watermarking information is not embedded in the protected models. Therefore, the protected models will not be deformed, as the watermarking information is not embedded in them. Thus, the contradiction between the transparency and robustness of a watermark is avoided.
Although the existing watermarking method can resist various signal processing attacks such as noise, smoothing, simplification, cropping, translation, and uniform scaling but it cannot resist rotation attacks. However, during the processing and transmission of 3D models, rotation occurs. This results in the synchronization loss of the watermark information, which render the 3D models illegal for usage without the infringement of their copyrights. A 3D model is a representation of a set of vertices which have no implicit order, unlike the pixels of a 2D image. When a 3D model rotates by any angle in 3D space, it becomes difficult to locate the origin of the coordinate system in which the watermark information is embedded. Even if the location of the primitive image that carries the watermarking information can be traced, it is difficult to identify which bit of the watermark the primitive image carries; this weakens the ability of these methods to combat rotation attacks. Thus, it is necessary to develop robust watermarking algorithms to offer protection against rotation attacks. In the case of transform methods [6], [8], [9], [26], if the transform coefficients carrying the watermark bits are traced from the transform domain, then these methods can effectively resist rotation attacks. However, the premise is that these transformation coefficients carrying the watermark bits should be identified by their attributes and not by their spatial coordinates; in contrast, spatial domain methods [10], [21], [23], [27] need to restore the coordinate system established during the embedding of the watermark to locate the watermarking position. To achieve this, the synchronization information should be unaffected by the watermarking information or rotation attacks.
The aim of our study was to explore a new zero-watermarking strategy to improve the performance of watermarking methods against rotation attacks. A binary image, representing the watermarking information was constructed by exploiting the attributes of a 3D model and was registered in the IPR database to ensure the copyright protection of the 3D model. When constructing the watermarking information, the vertices denoting the watermarking information were distinguished by their attributes rather than their spatial coordinates. Independent of the rotation angle of the models, the feature attributes remained unchanged and the proposed zero-watermarking strategy demonstrated enhanced resistance to the rotation attacks.
In this study, the areas of the 1-ring neighbourhood of the vertices were explored to identify the watermarked vertices. The area of each 1-ring neighbourhood was calculated and the 1-ring neighbourhood with a moderate area was projected onto its own tangent plane to generate a plane image. The X-axis of the plane image corresponded to the projection vector of the mesh line segment with the maximum curvature; the projected line segments on one side of the X-axis constituted the Beamlet dictionary, which was considered as the zero-watermarking image and was registered in the IPR database. Fig. 1 show the framework of the proposed method for a 3D model zero-watermark. The experimental results verified that the proposed zero-watermarking method effectively resisted the signal processing attacks, especially the rotation attacks. Moreover, our proposed method efficiently coordinated the robustness with the transparency of watermarks.Download : Download high-res image (511KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.
