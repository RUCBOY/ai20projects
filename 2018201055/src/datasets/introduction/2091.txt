Falls from heights (FFH) are a major contributor to workforce fatalities in construction [1]. It has been revealed that about 48% of accidents that occur in construction arise from FFH [2]. The construction of deep foundation pits for an underground metro-system, for example, invariably requires concrete and steel supports to be deployed to stabilize soil and transfer loads. In China, for example, individuals traversing structural supports over deep foundation-pits during the construction of underground metro-systems has been identified as a problem that site management have to regularly police, particularly as they a prone to not wearing a safety harness even when required to work at heights [3], [4], [5].
Numerous safety policies and procedures have been established to prevent people from FFH. For example, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires that a person working on a surface (horizontal and vertical) with an unprotected side or edge that is six feet or more above a lower level must be protected from falling by the use of guardrail systems, safety net systems, or a personal fall arrest system (PFAS) [6]. Yet, despite the considerable amount of research that has been undertaken and the implementation of policies, procedures and the development of protection measures, FFH remain a pervasive problem worldwide [5], [7].
The effectiveness of the link between safety climate and behavior plays a role in mitigating unsafe behavior. Traditionally, interventions have centered on the physical work environment and procedures to prevent errors and accidents [8]. Examples include the documentation of detailed procedures designed to provide the safest way to complete work, and the requirement for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be worn [8]. We have seen a subtle shift away from strict procedural guidelines that aim to mechanize and standardize behavior in construction, to a position that acknowledges individual differences and focuses on the psychological issues that influence behavior [9], [10], [11]. When an unsafe act occurs a failure in an individual’s cognition is produced. Such failure may arise at one of the following stages of the cognition process [12]: (1) detecting hazards; (2) recognizing hazards; (3) perceiving hazards; (4) deciding a response; and (5) executing the decided response. We can see from the research undertaken by Zhang and Fang [5] that there is a proclivity for people working at height in China (e.g. scaffolders) for their cognition to fail at stage four as they purposefully choose not to wear a safety harness even though they are legally required to do so. Such actions are referred to as violations, which are influenced by a person’s risk perception [13].
When a behavior is perceived to be a lower risk than others, then an individual’s motivation for safety is more positive [9]. But, Bohm and Jonathan [14] observed during construction when individuals perceive that there is a high risk of an unsafe behavior, they still engage in this action. Essentially, workers break-rules to make their work more efficient [15], [16], [17]. In the case of structural supports, people tend to use the structural supports as a short take-cut even though there is a likelihood that they can fall and injure themselves or even be killed [15], [16], [18]. People also judge managers’ attitudes to safety through their: (1) behaviors, interactions with them; (2) willingness to listen and learn; and (3) provide feedback [9], [10], [11]. However, the recognition of unsafe behavior often only arises during site inspections, or accidently or even when a co-worker informs site management. Thus, the opportunity for providing feedback to individuals about their unsafe behavior is limited.
To provide site management with the ability to recognize in real-time unsafe behavior and provide feedback to mitigate FFH, we develop a computer vision-based approach that can be deployed to automatically identify and capture people that traverse structural supports without PFAS in place. The approach that we have developed provides a cost-effective alternative to having a person physically observe workers and can be used to engender a climate of safety [19], [20]. Our research aligns with the benefits identified by several computer-vision based studies that have been undertaken in construction as we are able to automatically identify objects and recognize the activities undertaken by workers [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. While there has been a plethora of computer-vision studies undertaken in construction, there has been, to the authors knowledge, no research that has examined the issue of people traversing structural supports. Therefore, the research presented in this paper seeks to address this knowledge gap. In doing so we utilize a deep learning Mask Region Based Convolution Neural Network (R-CNN) to develop a computer vision approach that can accurately detect the presence of people traversing structural supports. We commence our research by commencing with a review of the extant computer vision literature that surrounds behavior recognition, then we introduce our novel computer vision approach, which is subsequently tested and validated using an experiment.
