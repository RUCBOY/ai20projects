Fuzzy Sets and Systems (FSS) is a leading international journal in applied mathematics and computer science focusing on the field of fuzzy set theory. The journal was founded in 1978 by Hans-Jürgen Zimmermann. In 1998, Didier Dubois and Henri Prade became the editors-in-chief of the journal. In 2007, Henri Prade stepped down, and Bernard De Baets became co-editor-in-chief. Currently, the journal is handled by Dubois and De Baets together with Eyke Hüllermeier and Lluis Godo, who became editors-in-chief in 2011 and 2016, respectively. The journal is very well recognized in the scientific community. In the 2018 edition of the Journal Citation Reports of Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), the journal received an impact factor of 2,907 and was placed at the 21st position of 105 journals in the Web of Science category of Computer Science: Theory & Methods, 16th position of 254 in Mathematics, Applied, and at the 7th position of 123 in Statistics, Probability.
In 2018, FSS became 40 years old. To celebrate this anniversary, this study presents a bibliometric overview of the publications in FSS during this period to identify the leading trends occurring in the journal. This work analyzes the publication and citation structure, showing the most cited papers and the most influential documents in the journal. This article also analyses the most productive and influential authors, institutions and countries and the leading keywords and topics. To do so, the work uses the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection database, the visualization of similarities (VOS) viewer [46] and the science mapping analysis tool (SciMAT) software [12].
Note that in the literature, it is very common to publish papers or special issues to celebrate a significant anniversary of a journal or an event [44], [47]. A key example in the fuzzy sets and systems community was the 50th anniversary of Fuzzy Logic [25]. FSS published a special issue [17] with some representative papers by key figures in the field [20], [57]. Many other journals have published special issues to celebrate specific anniversaries, including the Journal of Applied Psychology [28], the Journal of Political Economy [31] and the American Economic Review [2]. Additionally, some journals have published bibliometric analyses of their publications. Table 1 presents a list with some representative examples.Table 1.
