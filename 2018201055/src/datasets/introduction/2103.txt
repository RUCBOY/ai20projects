Lung cancer is a major health problem in the world. In 2016, the report proposed by Siegel noted that the estimated number of new cases and deaths would be 224,390 and 158,080 respectively in the United States [1]. Lung cancer has a poor prognosis without early detection and it has an average 5-year survival rate of less than 20% [2]. Thus, early detection of a lung lesion is very important to improve the survival rate of lung cancer [3].
Computed tomography (CT) scan is conventionally implemented to diagnose and stage lung lesions [4]. Nevertheless, it is not successful to evaluate the lymph node involvement and it has a not few pneumothorax rate after guiding fine needle aspiration [5]. Therefore, it is necessary to overcome these problems by other medical techniques, such as endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) [6]. The EBUS is a well-established technique which uses ultrasound to scan beyond the airway and the structures adjacent to it. Moreover, it has a better performance than CT to identify lesions around the central air way and peripheral lung nodules [7].
In order to differentiate benign and malignant lesions through the EBUS images, there are several works about subjective criteria summarized from the physician. The images including homogeneous internal echoes or concentric circles are suggested for benign lesions [8]. In contrast to the characteristic of benign lesion, the images with anechoic areas, luminant areas and heterogeneity internal echoes are regarded as malignant lesions [9]. However, it is still a challenge for a physician to diagnose a lesion as benign or malignant through the subjective criteria because it is dependent on the physician experiences on EBUS. Therefore, there is an interest in developing a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist the physician in diagnosis on EBUS images. There was only a CAD system for EBUS images diagnosis which used grayscale texture analysis for diagnosis [10]. However, it still required the experts to identify the region of interest (ROI) manually and spend time for designing the feature extraction.
Recently, a kind of deep learning, the convolutional neural network (CNN), which extracts features automatically had been used in the field of computer vision in the past decades [11], [12], [13]. The deep learning techniques also had been applied to the medical image analysis, such as the Otitis media diagnosis [14] and the breast lesion diagnosis [15]. The transfer learning also has been used in medical image analysis, such as the chest pathology identification [16], the interstitial lung disease classification and the thoracoabdominallymph node detection [17].
The CNN models such as AlexNet [18], OverFeat [19] can be used as the powerful generic feature extractors by extracting values from the fully connected layer as features. Moreover, it was successfully utilized in some computer vision works such as the classification and the object detection [20]. The features from the CNN model combined with the support vector machine (SVM) [21] can yield better performance compared to the original CNN [22]. However, there were no studies using the CNN to diagnose the EBUS images. Therefore, in this paper, a CAD system using the convolutional neural network was proposed to automatically differentiate benign and malignant lesions for early detecting lung cancer. The proposed CAD system consists of the data augmentation, the feature extraction based on fine-tuned CNN and the classification.
