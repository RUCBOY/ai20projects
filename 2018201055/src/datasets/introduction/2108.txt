Multiprocessor computer systems provide high-speed potentiality, but there are still problems on high reliability and fault-tolerance. Actually, the reason is related to the network topology of the multiprocessor computer system, such as hypercube, alternating group graphs, star graphs and arrangement graphs. It is worth mentioning that the arrangement graphs have high fault tolerance, small diameter and low node degrees. Thus, it is meaningful to further analyze the reliability of different arrangement graphs.
Subsystem-reliability is defined as the probability that a fault-free subgraph of a specific size is still available in the arrangement graph [1]. Many scholars have made researches on arrangement graphs An, k and star graphs Sn. [3] For example, Chianga et al. [14] presented relevant properties of An, k and gave the exact value of average distance of An, k, which is a k(n‒k) regular graph and has n!/(n‒k)! nodes. Cheng et al. [15] found the shortest path algorithm between two nodes in An, k and the algorithm can be applied to solve the same problem for other related graphs. Latifi et al. [6], [7] proposed both the lower bound and upper bound on the minimum number of faulty links, f (n, k), making every subgraph Sn‒k of Sn fail: ∑ikn!/(n−i)!≤f(n,k)≤k!CnkCn−1k and established the relationship between f (n, k) and its node counterpart F (n, k). Besides, Feng et al. [13] found bounds of the least-fault edges making each subgraph An,kn−m,k−m of An,k fail: n + n/k − 1 ≤ f1(n,k) ≤ 2n for 3≤k, and n!/(n−m)!≤fm(n,k)≤(km−1)×n!/(n−m)!−2(k−3m−1)×n!/(n−m+1)! for 2≤m≤k‒2. On the other hand, Zhou et al. [1], [2] defined s-reliability of An, k and Sn, and found bounds of the s-reliability by using the inclusion-exclusion principle. Moreover, Xiang et al. [10], [16] proposed local safety information that considers safety and fault-tolerance inside a health subcube called a maximal safe subcube in a hypercube and gave a new fault model called planar fault model to support the fault-tolerant planar routing algorithm called iPAR in meshes. Both methods considered fault-tolerance features when the sub-system contains faults. The fault tolerance and reliability of the arrangement graphs and other networks are also extensively studied in [5], [8], [11], [12]. Reliability and robustness of arrangement graph are worthy of study. In the previous research, there is no research on the robustness of the reliability bounds. We mainly study the bounds of s-reliability and its robustness.
The arrangement graph An,k is regarded as an attractive interconnection network in multiprocessor computer system. In this paper, we mainly consider the comparison of two different topologies of arrangement graphs with the same number of processors. However, in the process of proof, we find the reliability bounds of arrangement graph is not always useful. Thus, we consider the robustness of reliability bounds of arrangement graph, and prove that the larger n is, the higher s-reliability of An,k will be. We provide a theoretical basis for finding the topology of more reliable arrangement graph with the same number of processors. The simulation is carried out to verify the robustness of reliability bounds and comparison of more pairs of arrangement graph.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows. Section 2 introduces the background. Section 3 proposes a method to find infinite pairs of arrangement graphs, An1,k1, and An2,k2 with the same number of nodes. Section 4 analyzes s-reliability bound and its robustness. Section 5 proves which arrangement graph is more reliable An,k. Section 6 shows the data simulation. The last section concludes the paper.
