The development of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) system has received increased attention. HCI system development often requires interdisciplinary knowledge, such as design and technology (Hartson, 1998; Hewett et al., 1992; Preece, Sharp, & Rogers, 2015; Te’eni, Carey, & Zhang, 2007), persuasive technology for making behavior change (Agapie, Avrahami, & Marlow, 2016; Consolvo, McDonald, & Landay, 2009; Fogg, 2002; He, Greenberg, & Huang, 2010; Hekler, Klasnja, Froehlich, & Buman, 2013) or requires interdisciplinary team collaborations (Duncan, Hieftje, Culyba, & Fiellin, 2014) to optimize the requirements of desirability, feasibility and viability (Kandachar, 2010; Smith, 2007) for developing products, services and technologies for HCI systems.
In recent years, STEM has been extensively advocated and implemented in education to nurture learner’s interdisciplinary knowledge and skills, which can be seen as a significant driving force for a country’s development in scientific and technical knowledge, innovation, economy, and international competitiveness. STEM education has thus emerged as a paramount goal of many countries in the pursuit of excellence. STEM refers to “Science”, “Technology”, “Engineering”, and “Mathematics”, which is the skill set that is “expected to be held by people with a tertiary-education level degree in the subjects of science, technology, engineering and mathematics” (EU Skills Panorama, 2014; Fans & Ritz, 2014). Project-based learning (PBL) has also been widely recognized as an effective approach to immersing the learners in a contextualized and authentic learning setting, has therefore been commonly utilized to nurture the learner's creative problem solving capability in dealing with real-world problems (Grant & Branch, 2005; Hsu, 2004; Scott, Leritz, & Mumford, 2004). Nonetheless, it should be noted that it is quite challenging for engineering students to conduct an engineering project and make a product that is well-functioned and attentively addresses the demands of target users under PBL teaching method. Thus, for many engineering education, courses that require great amounts of hands-on experience extensively adopt PBL to cement students' practical use of knowledge (Calvo, Cabanes, Quesada, & Barambones, 2018).
The key issue that alarms us is that developing a useful and satisfactory HCI system development requires interdisciplinary knowledge and a set of skills from the areas of engineering, computer science, and design. While the expertise of engineering and computer science can help develop a system with adequate functions, the expertise of design can help improve the understanding of target users, better product ergonomics, and aesthetics, and even redesign or create the services associated with the products. Therefore, a STEM-based interdisciplinary PBL (STEM IPBL) has been proposed in this study, in which students from engineering and design departments were strategically grouped to work collaboratively on HCI system development projects, and helped them to acquire interdisciplinary STEM knowledge and skills more effectively. Besides the commonly used PBL approach in other studies, the STEM IPBL approach used by the current study has several features, including (a) The course taught throughout the experimental teaching placed a heavy weight on the learning and applying of STEM interdisciplinary knowledge and skills to solve more complex problems (Dym, Agogino, Eris, Frey, & Leifer, 2013). The details of the course design that systematically integrated the knowledge and skills of STEM can be refereed to Table 1. (b) Students from different majors were asked to be grouped for HCI systems development (each group contains 1–2 design majored student(s) and 2–3 engineering majored students. While the expertise of engineering and computer science can help develop a system with adequate functions, the expertise of design can help improve the understanding of target users, increase product ergonomics and aesthetics.Table 1.

The training of both design thinking and the ability to apply engineering knowledge into practice is systematically embedded in the STEM IPBL course (Brown, 2009; Cropley, 2016). All the groups are required to use their creative problem-solving skills to accomplish HCI system project that can be used to solve real-world issues. Furthermore, the basis of working in designated task groups enable the group members to work cooperatively and collaboratively while applying interdisciplinary STEM knowledge and skills in HCI system development for alleviating real-world problems. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that through the collaboration process within the cooperative learning, the students' communication and social skills can also be improved by participating in the course (Hirsch et al., 2001; Mamykina, Candy, & Edmonds, 2002).
