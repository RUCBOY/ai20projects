Keratoconus (KTC) is a non-infectious pathology that gradually deforms the cornea, the transparent structure at the front of the eye that focuses light through the lens on the retina. Healthy cornea has a convex aspherical shape and a large difference in refractive index compared to air, which makes it the strongest refractive element in the eye. Thus, any corneal alterations or irregularities, as seen in keratoconus, cause major vision impairment [1,2]. Typical signs of KTC range from progressive nearsightedness, irregular astigmatism, distorted or blurred vision, difficulties with night driving, and light sensitivity [3,4]. The incidence and prevalence of keratoconus vary depending on factors such as gender and ethnicity [3]. Nevertheless, keratoconus epidemiology is still unclear. An analysis that covered the entire Danish population reported an estimated prevalence of 86 keratoconus patients per 100 000 residents [5], while a more recent study suggests that the prevalence is significantly higher than around 1:2000 [6]. The condition usually affects both eyes, albeit not necessarily simultaneously. Although the underlying causes are not well understood, there are indications that the disease is multifactorial in origin, related to genetic predisposition and environmental factors such eye rubbing, certain eye conditions and family history [[1], [2], [3]].
In clinical practice the highly irregular shape of advanced keratoconic cornea is easily identified, while the detection of early stages of the disease remains an important challenge. Therefore, developing an efficient technique to assist practitioners with objectively detecting early keratoconus is of paramount importance, as it allows planning more effective treatment strategies and avoiding further acuity loss. Keratoconus diagnosis was initially addressed by the introduction of videokeratography and later by Scheimpflug tomography. Videokeratography provides accurate information about anterior corneal surface shape, while the Scheimpflug tomographer adds information on the posterior corneal surface and corneal thickness. The availability of these measurements led to the introduction of various indices for keratoconus detection. Several authors developed keratoconus detection approaches based on a combination of parameters, such as, keratoconus index (KCI%) [7], inferior superior value (IS value) [8], keratoconus severity index (KSI) [9], KISA% index [10], keratoconus severity score (KSS) [11], Score [12], Belin/Ambrosio Enhanced Ectasia Display (BAD-D) [13], topographical keratoconus classification (TKC), and more recently Pentacam Random Forest Index (PRFI) [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]]. Most of these approaches introduce a specific combination of parameters to machine learning algorithms.
Machine learning (ML) algorithms are rapidly gaining importance in the health sector. They are often used to assist in medical diagnosis tasks by capturing the most relevant clinical features of complex data, providing early interpretable results, and helping to choose suitable treatment strategies [[34], [35], [36], [37]]. In the past two decades, several methods have been proposed to automatically detect keratoconus using mathematical models and machine learning [3,22,23,[38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]]. These efforts were limited as they only considered ‘classic’ forms, rather than hybrid approaches of modelling and machine learning. Studies that focused on keratoconus detection employed traditional machine learning to corneal elevation or other extracted clinical parameters, thus neglecting practical restrictions, such as the high variability and sometimes the unstructured nature of corneal tomography data, which requires long computational time. Moreover, the classic algorithms are sensitive to the initial condition and show low accuracies in the earliest cases of the condition. The instability within the earliest cases reduce the performance and the practical use of ML algorithms. However, more stable results are usually achieved in the absence of highly correlated groups, such as advanced keratoconus versus normal or after applying appropriate data preprocessing techniques [45,46]. Some previous works therefore suggested the use of mathematical modelling followed by statistical analysis of clinically derived parameters [28,29,47,48]. These studies are potentially low cost, but mostly platform dependent as they often use proprietary parameters associated with one particular commercial device or manufacturer, thus hampering cross-platform reproducibility of the results.
This paper proposes a computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the automatic detection of keratoconus, based on corneal tomography maps and minimum corneal thickness that can be captured by any Scheimpflug device. This system takes the highly unstructured and uninterpretable number of datasets into consideration, as well as the algorithm's instability to the earliest cases of the disease, while also improving the accuracy. The system consists of three main steps. First, a custom-made mathematical model of keratoconic cornea is presented to transform the unstructured topographies to a limited number of meaningful features. Next, a feedforward neural network (FFN) is used to process the model derived features. This type of neural network was selected since it performs better when dealing with corneal topographies [38]. To preserve the stability and improve the accuracies in detecting KTC, a Grossberg architecture was used based on an iterative numerical method, combined with both the feedforward neural network and the mathematical model.
The proposed system overcomes the inherent complexity of tomographical data and permits an accurate detection of keratoconus at the early stage. This framework also optimizes the memory space required in comparison to the direct use of feedforward neural network [38]. Moreover, the CAD has the potential to be platform independent and reproducible on other systems since it only relies on corneal tomography and pachymetry, which is available in all Scheimpflug systems. This requires further validation, however. Finally, the principles of proposed iterative method can be applied to improve the stability and the repeatability of other machine learning techniques.
