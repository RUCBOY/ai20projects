In recent years, the occurrence of wooden breast (WB) in broilers has been reported and is associated with the rapid growth and development of breasts, but its etiology remains unclear [1], [2], [3]. To meet the growing demand for chicken meat, mainly from western countries, genetic improvement is used as an important solution for the poultry industry to obtain high-yielding broilers [4]. However, this has led to an increased incidence of WB in Europe, USA and Brazil, and is associated with the rapid growth and development of chicken breast [5], [1], [2], [3].
WB is characterized by reduced meat quality related to undesirable changes in visual aspects, technological characteristics, and nutritive properties [2], [6], [7], [8]. WB myopathy shows hardness and pale areas, superficial viscous fluid and can be accompanied by white striping (WS) [2]. In addition, the breast shows alterations in chemical and technological characteristics, such as increased moisture and lipid contents, reduced protein content and water holding capacity [1], [2], [6], [7], [8]. The identification and characterization of WB at the slaughterhouse are based on visible appearance and hardness of chicken breast [2] and depends on the sensitivity, training, and knowledge of the analyst.
The use of rapid, non-destructive, and accurate analytical methods has increased among industry professionals seeking to optimize food quality inspection lines and reduce measurement time and costs [8], [9], [10]. These methods include near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy and image analysis. NIR spectroscopy is a nondestructive, efficient, and rapid technique for measuring properties from complex food matrices such as moisture, carbohydrate, lipid, and protein contents using regression models [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. NIR-based analysis involves large groups of overtones and combination bands related to chemical bonds usually linked to the desired response information [16]. Commonly, multivariate analysis is used to extract information from NIR spectra, which can also be employed for modeling the studied problem. This multivariate model evaluates characteristics extracted from a sample based on its spectral properties and can be used to predict attributes in new samples [17].
In contrast, image analysis solutions have been widely employed because of their flexibility, simplicity, low-cost, and reduced processing time. An example of this flexibility was explored by Barbin et al. [18] through automatic broiler breast color measurements, which presented larger and trustful areas measured in contrast of the small area measured by colorimeter. A CVS is a computing implementation of an automate image analysis solution for sample analysis from the acquisition to decision step. Sun [19] described CVS as a fast, robust, objective, non-destructive, and reliable method, as a low-cost alternative for laboratory analysis. In some applications, it is possible to simulate the human technicianâ€™s visual and instrumental inspection using a CVS, for example, to estimate fat content in poultry meat [19]. Features extracted from images are often used for classification of samples and to create prediction models of quality parameters. Some approaches include linear methods and non-linear machine learning algorithms, such as SVM, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Decision Trees (DT), and Random Forest (RF) [20]. There are no reports in the literature regarding the application and comparison of two non-destructive methods, such as NIR spectroscopy and CVS, in order to obtain a more accurate method to identify and classify chickens with WB.
Therefore, considering the impact of WB myopathy on the quality and acceptability of chicken breast, the aim of this study was to identify and classify chicken with WB using a CVS and spectral information from the NIR region by linear and nonlinear algorithms. In addition, physicochemical and technological parameters of N and WB samples were carried out.
