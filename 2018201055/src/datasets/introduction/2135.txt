Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a versatile noninvasive and radiation-free imaging modality. Over 60 million MRI scans are performed worldwide each year [1]. MRI is generally considered a safe imaging modality. However, the MRI scan environment is less than patient friendly. The confined space of the magnet and the loud repetitive acoustic noise generated during the scan [2,3] are two major factors that promote anxiety in the MRI environment. Anxiety-related reactions during MRI occur in 2–30% in the general population, resulting in early scan termination in 1–5% of patients [[4], [5], [6], [7]].
The MRI acoustic noise arises as a result of rapid-switching of electrical currents in the gradient coils, which causes vibrations in the coils and the surrounding structures [8]. The resulting noise pressure levels may exceed 100 dB(A) [9,10], which necessitates the use of hearing protection such as earplugs and headphones [8,11,12]. While hearing protection significantly attenuates the sound level, acoustic noise remains a source of anxiety that adversely affects the patient experience with MRI scanning [13].
It has been recognized that the perception of a stimulus depends on the presence of other stimuli in the environment due to the multisensory integration nature of the brain [[14], [15], [16], [17]]. Hence, the perception of loud repetitive MRI noise could be modulated by the introduction of other sensory inputs. Thus, patients undergoing MRI scanning are often provided with music or radio through headphones. The audio material serves as a distraction from the MRI environment and attenuates the perception of the scanner noise.
Multisensory studies suggest that vision dominates our sensory input and can bias the perception of other stimuli [17]. Thus, visual input may have better distracting effects than acoustic stimulus on the patient. Typical video distraction in MRI, when available, is provided in the form of conventional multimedia content (e.g. movies). However, acoustic noise remains as an external source that interferes with the audio/video material provided for distraction. On the contrary, presenting sensory inputs modulated by the MRI acoustic noise has been suggested to improve patient experience [18,19], and preliminary studies has shown promise in healthy adults [19].
We hypothesized that computer-generated animations synchronized to the MRI acoustic noise may provide a favorable modulation of the perception of the loud repetitive auditory stimulus for patients, and could even turn the acoustic noise into a form of entertainment that engages the patient and shifts his/her focus from the MRI environment. In this work, we investigated this hypothesis in a population of pediatric patients with bipolar disorder undergoing routine clinical MRI scanning.
