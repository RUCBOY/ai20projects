In work the technological process of hot rolling with the use of a lubricant is explored. The feature of hot rolling technology with the use of lubricants is widely described in the works [1], [2], [3], [4]. The works [5], [6], [7] present the results of scientific research describing the process of hot rolling, study and evaluate the positive aspects of the use of a lubricant [8], as well as the results of improving the durability of parts and components of the rolling equipment, including mill rolls [9], [10], [11], [12].
The study of the interaction process in hot rolling technology was carried out using three-dimensional numerical simulation based on the DEFORM-3D software package, which used embedded preprocessor, postprocessor, and the finite element method for solving problems (hereinafter referred to as FEM).
In most cases, when modeling technical and technological processes, where the interaction of the surfaces of the friction devices is considered, the lubricant is numerically taken into account by the friction coefficient. For a number of problems, this assumption does not affect the convergence of calculations and practical results. However, for the described hot rolling process, in the technology of which the lubricant is supplied to the surface of the upper (supporting) roll, this assumption is incorrect, since the slippage phenomenon, which often occurs in practice, is not revealed in the simulation. The presence of a lubricant and its influence on hot rolling technology can be identified by applying the numerical solution of problems by the finite element method and implementing it on the basis of the DEFORM-3D software package.
