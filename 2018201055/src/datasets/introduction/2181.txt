Let v(x,t) be a complex-valued solution of a nonlinear Schroedinger’s equation (x∈Rn, t>0) ivt+Δv+v|v|p−1=0.Here p>1 is a constant, and |v| denotes the modulus of v. Looking for the standing waves, one substitutes v(x,t)=eimtu(x), with a real valued u(x), and a constant m>0. Then u(x) satisfies Δu−mu+u|u|p−1=0.For a more general equation, where v(x,t) is a complex-valued solution of ivt+Δv+f(v)=0a similar reduction works for any complex valued function f(v), satisfying f(eimtu)=eimtf(u),for any real m and u,and it leads to the equation Δu−mu+f(u)=0.We shall study the radially symmetric solutions of this equation, with r=|x|, satisfying (1.1)u′′+n−1ru′−mu+f(u)=0.Of particular interest will be sign-changing ground state solutions, with arbitrary many roots. These are solutions satisfying limr→∞u(r)=0.
Let us discuss the solutions of the initial value problem (1.2)u′′+n−1ru′+f(u)=0,r>0,u(0)=a,u′(0)=0,modeled on f(u)=−u+u|u|p−1, for all initial values a>1 (for which f(a)>0), and all r>0, with a sub-critical p, 1<p<n+2n−2. Since u′′(0)=−1nf(a)<0, the solution u(r) goes down for small r>0. (In the model case, u′′(0)=1n(a−ap)<0.) Define the “energy” E(r)=12u′2(r)+F(u(r)), where F(u)=∫0uf(t)dt. We have (1.3)ddrE(r)=−n−1ru′2<0,and so the energy is decreasing. The initial energy at r=0 is equal to F(a). The energy at any root r0 is equal to 12u′2(r0)>0. Since energy is decreasing along solutions, it follows that the initial energy F(a) must be positive and high enough, in order for the solution to have roots, and higher energy is needed to have more roots. After the initial energy is dissipated, the solutions get captured by either one of the stable roots of f(u), tending to either 1 or −1 as r→∞. Ground states are the exceptional unstable solutions tending to 0 as r→∞, and separating different stable behaviors.
When the initial energy is low, solutions turn around while staying positive, and then tend to 1 as r→∞. At the next higher energy level solutions have enough energy to develop one root, and then they tend to −1 as r→∞. Computations suggest that there is a unique positive ground state solution, separating the above two regimes. Uniqueness of positive ground state solution was proved for a class of f(u) for which uf′(u)f(u) is decreasing, see M.K. Kwong [1]. This class includes the model case f(u)=−u+u|u|p−1, but not other similar equations, like f(u)=−2u+u3+u4. Other results for both the Dirichlet and the ground state problems, under the condition that the function uf′(u)f(u) is decreasing, can be found in M.K. Kwong [1], L. Zhang [2], M.K. Kwong and Y. Li [3], P. Korman, Y. Li, and T. Ouyang [4], T. Ouyang and J. Shi [5], M.K. Kwong and L. Zhang [6]). Radial sign-changing solutions were studied for a related equation in E. Yanagida and S. Yotsutani [7].
At the next higher energy level solutions have two roots, and then they tend to 1 as r→∞. This level is separated from the preceding one by a ground state solution with one root. Proving its uniqueness appears to be out of the question at present. The latter energy level is separated by the ground state solution with two roots from the next level, involving the solutions with 3 roots, tending to −1, and so on.
We approach the initial value problem (1.2) by studying the solution curves of the parameter dependent boundary value problems (1.4)u′′+n−1ru′+λf(u)=0,r>0,u′(0)=0,with either the Dirichlet (1.5)u(1)=0,or the Neumann (1.6)u′(1)=0boundary condition. Any solution of the problem (1.2) with the first root at some ξ corresponds to a positive solution of the Dirichlet problem (1.4), (1.5) at λ=ξ2, after rescaling. As λ varies, we have a curve of positive solutions of the Dirichlet problem, denoted by D0. Any solution of the problem (1.2) with the first point of zero slope at some η corresponds to a solution of the Neumann problem (1.4), (1.6) at λ=η2, after rescaling. We denote by N0 the curve of positive solutions of the Neumann problem (1.4), (1.6).
We also performed computations for f(u)=−2u+u3+u4, and n=3, which is a problem considered in [8]. It differs from our model case, since f(u) has only one positive root but no negative ones. The model for that case is f(u)=−u+|u|p. For small values of the energy the solutions in both cases oscillate around 1. On the other when the solution has developed a root then the solution in the second case will tend to minus infinity since f(u(r))<0 for u<0. In Fig. 1 we draw D0 (the higher curve) and N0 for the model case f(u)=−u+u2. Since the picture remains the same for related functions, it provides strong evidence of the uniqueness of the positive ground state, which occurs at the value of u(0) where D0 and N0 come together.
When it comes to sign-changing ground state solutions, no uniqueness or multiplicity results are proved even for the model case f(u)=−u+u|u|p−1, which we will consider from now on. We compute similarly Dk’s, the Dirichlet curves with k interior roots on (0,1), and the properly defined Neumann curves Nk. Fig. 2 shows that each Neumann curve tends to two adjacent Dirichlet curves, and it provides strong numerical evidence of the uniqueness of nodal ground states, where Dk and Nk come together. Notice the very sharp turns to the right that each Neumann curve makes, which presented considerable computational challenge.
