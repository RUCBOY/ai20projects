Holographic display can reconstruct all the three-dimensional information of an object in space from a computer-generated hologram (CGH), and is considered to be the most potential technique to achieve true 3D display without any wearable devices. Common methods for holographic display are based on the planar CGHs. In the past decade, color holography gains a great development. Currently, color holographic display can be realized by using only one spatial light modulator (SLM). Several approaches which employ one SLM for realizing full-color holographic display includes: the depth-division method (DDM) [1], [2], the time-division method (TDM) [3], [4], [5], [6], the space-division method (SDM) [7], [8], [9], the frequency-division method (FDM) [10] and other similar methods [11], [12], [13]. All of these methods are based on the calculation and display of one planar CGH.
However, the limitation by using planar CGH is obvious. The view angle is limited by the shape and the pixel pitch of the SLM according to Nyquist theory [14]. In addition, the reconstructed object cannot be observed from the opposite of the planar CGH, preventing people from receiving more information of a 3D object. These constraints could be overcome by using computer-generated cylindrical hologram (CGCH), in which the hologram of an object is calculated on a cylindrical surface. CGCH offers a viewing angle of 360°and can be observed from any direction, enables full motion and binocular parallax [15], [16]. Several computation algorithms for CGCH have also been developed. Sando et al. proposed a method for cylindrical holograms calculation by defining propagation in spatial domain using convolution  [17]. Yamaguchi et al. proposed a method for calculating CGCH based on segmentation and lookup table [18]. Jackin et al. introduced another method by using helical wave spectrum in cylindrical coordinates to calculate CGCH, which can be understood as an extension of the angular spectrum method to the cylindrical coordinates system [19]. Sando et al. proposed a fast calculation method for CGCH on the basis of 3D Fourier spectrum, allowing the calculation of object wave in all directions and then it can be realized by using 1D convolution and an inverse Fourier transform [20]. Recently, Zhao et al. proposed a method to calculate CGCH by setting a virtual wave-front recording surface located between the object and CGCH [21]. All of these algorithms are concerned for CGCH calculation in monochrome situation, in which only one wavelength is considered in the calculation and reconstruction. So far, there is no report on the calculation of CGCH for displaying color object.
In this paper, we will introduce a method to calculate single phase-only CGCH for color holographic display. We first explore the property defined as “product invariance principle” between wavelength and distance in reconstruction from the CGCH. Then we design a multi-cylindrical surface (MCS) based iterative algorithm to calculate a phase-only CGCH from the RGB components of a color object. The RGB components are set on different radial distances during the calculation. Based on the “product invariance principle”, this single CGCH can reconstruct the wanted RGB component on the same radial distance to final superpose into a color reconstruction. The idea of this method is inspired from that reported by Makowski et al. [1], [2], in which the “product invariance principle” is used to synthesize planar CGH for color image projection. We further extend this idea to the calculation of CGCH of general color 3D object. This method allows encoding all of the RGB component information into one phase-only CGCH instead of three, without any loss in pixel resolution.
