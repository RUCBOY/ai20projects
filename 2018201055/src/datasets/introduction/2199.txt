Advanced technology plays a significant role in medical diagnosis. Todayâ€™s medicine needs to improve diagnostics of diseases or pathologies [1], [2]. Computer-aided algorithms are increasingly vital in automatization of radiological tasks, such as segmentation of anatomical structures and different regions of interest [3], [4]. These algorithmic calculations, called image segmentation, are indispensable in various biomedical imaging applications. Examples include the evaluation of tissue quantity, detection and segmentation of pathology, investigation of anatomical structure, treatment support, and computer-aided medical procedure [5], [6]. With the fast progression of computer innovation, computer-aided segmentation is crucial for understanding the challenges in image processing and computer vision. In therapeutic imaging, image segmentation assists in restorative imaging by depiction of the anatomical structures and regions of interest [7], [8]. A few methodologies of restorative image segmentation are described in the literature. Image segmentation algorithms are commonly based on one of the two properties of intensity estimation: discontinuity and similarity [9], [10]. The first approach is to segment an image depending on sudden changes in intensity, for example, edges in an image [11]. The second approach is to partition an image into regions that are comparable according to a set of predefined criteria [12], [13]. Thresholding, region growing, and region splitting and merging are examples of strategies in this class. In therapeutic imaging, especially in osteonecrosis of the dental cancer, images of jaw bone region have in homogenous intensity. This problem is caused by defectiveness of imaging devices or illumination variations that may happen in images, and it leads to misclassification when using intensity-based segmentation (which expects a uniform intensity). Generally, it is difficult to precisely segment dental cancer in jaw bone pictures when intensity is in homogenous because existing methods expect a uniform intensity of the image [14], [15].
Therefore, efforts to handle intensity inhomogeneity become vital. Such efforts include usage of piecewise smooth (PS) models and local level-set methods. This study proposes a level region-based active contour segmentation algorithm to detect dental cancer in images of jaw bone region, with and without intensity inhomogeneity, by combining local geometric property (LGP) and local image fitting property (LIFP) [16], [17].
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 1 presents an overview of challenges in medical image segmentation, motivation for the research, and outline of the work. Section 2 describes related work in medical image segmentation, with a focus on cancer in the jaw bone region. Section 3 describes the proposed hybrid LGP-LIFP algorithm for osteonecrosis of jaw, a type of dental cancer. Region segmentation with and without intensity inhomogeneity by using a local statistical approach and local image fitting method is presented and discussed. In Section 4, performance of the above contributions is analyzed with Matrix Laboratory. The proposed method outperforms the baselines. Section 5 presents the conclusion and discussed directions for future work.
