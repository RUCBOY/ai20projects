All human appearance traits are highly heritable phenotypes, with examples of body height with up to 80 % [1], facial shapes with up to 90 % [2], hair shape with up to 95 % [3]; hair and eye colour with up to 99 % [4] estimated heritability values. Various genome-wide association studies (GWASs), the more recent ones with large sample size, have revealed numerous underlying genes per each of several human appearance traits such as eye colour [[5], [6], [7]], hair colour [5,8,9]; eyebrow colour [10], skin colour [5,8,11], hair structure [12,13], hair loss in men [14], facial shape [2], body height [[15], [16], [17]], explaining varying portions of their heritability and highlighting their complex genetic nature. Some appearance phenotypes are highly correlated with each other in human populations, such as certain facial shapes [2], and especially the different human pigmentation traits [10]. It is common knowledge that, for instance, blue eye colour shows a tendency to co-occur with blond hair and light skin colour in Europeans, red hair colour typically co-occurs with pale skin colour and often with freckles in Europeans, and dark skin colour usually co-occurs with black hair and brown eye colour in Africans, certain Asian populations, New Guineans and Australian Aborigines. Moreover, GWAS outcomes have revealed that the different human pigmentation traits share a large (but not complete) proportion of underlying genetic components that explains their phenotypic correlations [5,8,10].
Previously, predictive DNA markers were identified and statistical prediction models were developed for all pigmentation-related traits, namely eye colour [[18], [19], [20]], head hair colour [9,[21], [22], [23]], skin colour [[24], [25], [26]], eyebrow colour [10], and freckles [27,28]. The recently established HIrisPlex-S system [26] currently represents the most complete DNA-based pigmentation prediction tool, allowing simultaneous prediction of eye, head hair, and skin colour from DNA, including low quality and low quantity forensic DNA, based on 41 carefully selected DNA markers and three separate prediction models. HIrisPlex-S reflects an extension of the previously developed IrisPlex system for eye colour [19] and the previous HIrisPlex system for eye and hair colour prediction [22]. Genotyping assays of the HIrisPlex-S system are available based on SNaPshot single base extension technology and capillary electrophoresis (CE) [26], in addition to two widely used massively parallel sequencing (MPS) technologies: Ion Torrent and Illumina [29]. Moreover, the VISAGE Consortium recently incorporated the HIrisPlex-S DNA markers together with continental ancestry informative DNA markers to function as all-in-one tools for both MPS platforms separately (Xavier et al. under review; Palencia-Madrid et al. under review). All available genotyping assays of the IrisPlex, the HIrisPlex, and the HIrisPlex-S systems have been forensically validated [26,[29], [30], [31]]. The three statistical prediction models, i.e., the IrisPlex model for eye colour [19], the HIrisPlex model for hair colour [22], and the HIrisPlex-S model for skin colour prediction [26] are all publically available in their most updated versions [26] via the website https://hirisplex.erasmusmc.nl/.
These laboratory and/or statistical tools are already of practical relevance for DNA-based pigmentation trait prediction in several different applications such as forensic investigation [32,33], human history inference [34], and anthropological research [35], with more applications being expected in the future. Within the concept of Forensic DNA Phenotyping, predicting pigmentation traits of an unknown crime scene sample donor directly from crime scene DNA can provide useful investigative leads to find unknown perpetrators of the crime, in cases without a DNA profile match with a known suspect [32,33]. In human history investigations, DNA-based pigmentation prediction allows us to reveal the pigment of historical individuals from analysing their remains [34]. In anthropological and human evolutionary research, genetic pigmentation prediction captures how humans and human populations may have looked in the past, including the distant past [35], and allows a deeper understanding of the evolutionary history of human pigmentation traits [36].
However, all currently available genetic prediction models for pigmentation traits ignore the well-known correlations between the different pigmentation phenotypes and their underlying genotypes. It could be expected, however, that considering phenotype correlations in the genetic prediction modelling may increase the accuracy of DNA-based prediction for eye, hair and skin colour, which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported as of yet. Here, we empirically tested for the impact of correlations between appearance phenotypes and their underlying genotypes on DNA-based appearance prediction using pigmentation traits as classical example. We applied categorical eye, hair and skin colour phenotype data and genotype data for the 41 HIrisPlex-S DNA markers from 762 individuals for whom complete phenotype and genotype information was available. Based on these data, we empirically estimated pigmentation phenotype correlations and their proportions that were attributable to the 41 HIrisPlex-S DNA markers. Next, we performed genetic prediction modelling of eye, hair and skin colour via three different strategies, namely the established approach of predicting phenotypes solely based on genotypes while not considering phenotype correlations, and two novel approaches considering phenotype correlations, either incorporating truly observed correlated phenotypes or DNA-predicted correlated phenotypes as additional predictors, and compared the prediction accuracies of these different models by empirical observation. Finally, we conducted computer simulations, emulating the three different prediction strategies, to better understand the impact of phenotype and genotype correlations on DNA-based phenotype prediction in an effort to interpret the outcomes of the empirical pigmentation prediction modelling we obtained.
