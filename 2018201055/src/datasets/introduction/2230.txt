Efficiency in software development depends largely on the quality of the processes used to create it [1]. These processes are based mostly on quality standards, which provide proven practices. These standards contribute to the development of quality products while optimizing efforts and resources [2], [3]. While their benefits are important for all software development enterprises, they are extremely important for small enterprises to survive [2], [3]. They become critical in small and very small organizations because both must work harder in order to survive and grow. Therefore, they should optimize time and effort to improve their operations and processes [4], [5].
In Mexico, over 98% of the software development enterprises are small or very small enterprises [6]. There are two situations that happen most of the time: (1) the organization hires newly graduated people [7] or (2) newly graduated people created the organization. In this context, the academia should provide qualified professionals able to work with quality models and standards that enhance the quality and effectiveness of software developed by Mexican small and very small organizations. Therefore, one of the most significant practices to be addressed in software education is to reduce the gap between educational programs and software practitioners [7], [8], [9].
One of the most used Models in Mexico, recognized by the Ministry of Economic, is Process Model for the Software Industry (MoProSoft) [10]. In a previous study [11], the coverage of the MoProSoft concepts in the Mexican curricula programs related to Computer Science and Informatics and Software Engineering was analyzed. In a follow-up paper, the coverage of the international standard ISO/IEC 29110 was also analyzed [12].
Because ISO/IEC 29110 engineering and management guides are easier to understand than more advanced standards by students and are freely available [13], it has greatly helped support their adoption. Universities of more than 17 countries, such as Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Haiti, Jordan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Thailand and USA, are teaching ISO/IEC 29110. Based on this, ISO/IEC 29110 has been used by many students to develop their first products [14]. For instance, in Thailand, more than 10 universities teach ISO/IEC 29110, and in Canada, it is taught in many software quality assurance and software process improvement courses. In addition, students are implementing ISO/IEC 29110 processes in their undergraduate and graduate capstone projects [15].
In Mexico universities and research centers, such as the Software Engineering Unit of CIMAT (Centro de Investigación en Matemáticas), Universidad de Guadalajara, Universidad de Sonora, and Universidad de Aguascalientes, are doing research focusing on ISO/IEC 29110. These universities are integrating a team to work together using ISO/IEC 29110 mainly in two states of Mexico, Zacatecas and Aguascalientes, having the following two goals [14]:
•Performing research focused on helping Very Small Entities (VSEs) in the implementation of ISO/IEC 29110.•Training undergraduates and master level students in the use of ISO/IEC 29110.
Mexico's attempts to improve its software industry led to the development of the MoProSoft reference model in 2002. MoProSoft was built on the well-known practices of the Software Engineering Institute's retired Capability Maturity Model for Software (SW-CMM®) [16], ISO 9000, the Project Management Institute's project management body of knowledge (PMBOK® Guide), and others. It offered a new process structure, some new process-documentation elements, a more precise process relationship, and an explicit process-improvement mechanism [17].
In this paper, a comparison among the results of those studies is conducted. We mapped ISO/IEC 29110 to MoProSoft and vice versa focusing on level two of MoProSoft [17] and the Basic profile of ISO/IEC 29110. This comparison resulted in a guide for curricula programs to understand the degree of coverage for the two standards, and for the undergraduate school or small enterprises software developers to define a path for accreditation.
The question that addresses this research is: Why does ISO/IEC 29110 provide better coverage for the curricula of Mexican universities than the MoProSoft model?
After the introduction, Section 2 provides an overview of the MoProSoft model and the ISO/IEC 29110 standard; Section 3 presents related works regarding the implementation of ISO/IEC 29110; Section 4 describes the research background in which previous analysis were performed with MoProSoft and ISO/IEC 29110; Section 5 presents a comparison of curricula's coverage with the MoProSoft and ISO/IEC 29110; Section 6 shows the implementation of ISO/IEC 29110 by a set of Mexican Universities of the Zacatecas State; Section 7 presents the discussion, and finally, Section 8 shows conclusions and future work.
