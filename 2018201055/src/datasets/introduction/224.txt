Ocean occupies for 70 percent of the earth and contains rich natural resources, which has been a long-term and enduring concern for human development. With the rapid progresses of the marine exploitation and observation, there is increasing interests in the exploring this mysterious area of the ocean. However, confronted with relatively hash and unconstrained marine scenes, many severe adverse factors, include water with high turbidity, uneven illumination, monotonous color, complicated underwater-background, which seriously affect the integrity and availability of underwater image in practical application.
In order to tackle with these issues, many relevant underwater-vision researches have been conducted on exploring mature and effective underwater image processing (UIP) models in recent decades. In this review, we will discuss the processing and analyzing methods of underwater images, containing both traditional methods and recently emerged models of deep-learning. Especially, underwater image - enhancement, - fog removal, - segmentation, - noise reduction, - saliency detection and - color constancy under marine environment will be discussed in detail. The cardinal contents of this review are summarized in the below:

•A relatively comprehensive review of underwater image processing is conducted to categorized off-the-shelf models into seven sub-classes;•Some publicly accessible underwater-image data sets used in the literatures are presented;•The main problems and challenges in the underwater vision field are discussed along with some suggestions for future investigation of underwater image processing.
The reminder of this survey is presented as below. Section 2 introduces the representative frameworks on different underwater image processing (UIP) and analysis approaches. Section 3 introduces the designed system at length. Then the challenges and future suggestions are presented in Section 4. Finally, a conclusion will be given in Section 5.
