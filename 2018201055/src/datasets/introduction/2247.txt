The growing complexity of systems, environment interactions, and stringent time and performance requirements may create anomalous situations and some uncertainty in system operation. Monitoring system operation and deriving features useful in system evaluation and detecting or predicting anomalies can help with this uncertainty. Monitoring mechanisms in contemporary systems provide rich log repositories comprising registered events, values of performance metrics, process activities, etc. [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Despite many studies on computer logs, there is still a strong need to develop log analysis methods adapted to log properties and research tasks. Performance logging is a basic source of information on system operation which gives insights into its activity, resource usage, application deficiencies, etc. Special techniques are needed to extract operational features from the logged data, identify possible threats and detect problems. They can also support the assessment of system operation, behavioural and usage trends, service quality, etc.
Most papers on performance analysis are problem-oriented and focused on specific issues, e.g. detecting system attacks or malware [6], [7], characterizing system bottlenecks and resource usage [2], [8], [9], software optimization [10], [11] and aging problems [12], etc. They process the collected samples of performance parameters in relation to time (flat sample model). This paper presents a new advanced log analysis approach targeted at identifying characteristic operational features which facilitate finding symptoms of normal and anomalous behaviour. These features describe system operation profiles in run-time with diverse time resolution and data views which significantly extend the scope and perspectives of observations. This approach has evolved from our experience with system monitoring [4], [13], [14], [15], [16].
The most important contribution of this paper is a new hierarchical data model (which is a generalization and extension of our idea outlined in [13]) and relevant exploration algorithms. Unlike past works, the presented data analysis is performed at several abstract levels (samples, pulses and their compositions) which results in new metrics and properties. The original algorithms developed for this data model identify diverse data objects and provide a wide spectrum of pulse-oriented statistics, including periodicity issues and multidimensional correlations defined by complex formulas. The introduced observation perspectives and aggregated data sample objects significantly extend system characterization compared with other published approaches. In particular, the samples comprised in a data object quite often can be correlated with the same system activities or problems, which is not visible within the classical flat data model. Such holistic analysis facilitates identifying problems in system operation, preparing countermeasures (e.g. reactive or proactive actions, software upgrades, system reconfigurations) to minimize potential damages, or preplanning preventive maintenance activities.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines related work and highlights the problems considered in the paper. Section 3 addresses the problem of identifying basic features characterizing system performance parameters within a time series. Section 4 introduces our pulse-oriented model and correlated analysis algorithms. Section 5 presents illustrative results of data exploration related to collected measurements in real computer systems. Finally, we summarize our contribution in Section 6.
