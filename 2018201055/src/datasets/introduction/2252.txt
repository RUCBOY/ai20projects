Construction has a poor safety record when compared to other industrial sectors worldwide; workplace accidents are a common occurrence [15], [12], [48], [50], [28]. Previous research has revealed that approximately 88% of accidents in construction are related to people’s unsafe behavior [38]. With this in mind, a considerable amount of attention has focused on mitigating unsafe behaviors in construction using a wide variety of institutional, regulatory, and legislator mechanisms. With the presence of cost and time pressures and the regular need to perform unplanned work (e.g., rework) people are prone to taking risks to make their work more efficient [47], [49], [50]. The upshot in this instance is that there is a proclivity for people to commit unsafe acts, especially when they know they are not being supervised.
Behavior-based safety (BBS) is an effective approach that can be used to observe and identify people’s unsafe actions [73]. The direct feedback provided to people who have committed an unsafe act is used to modify their future behavior [9], [4], [51], [31]. The process of observation is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and as a result, events may be inaccurately recorded and prone to selective bias. Developments in technology, aided by computer vision have been identified as an effective approach to automatically recognize people’s unsafe behavior [34], [37], [58], [11], [16], [18], [77], [30]. For example, Fang et al. [18] developed a computer vision approach that integrated a Mask R-Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to identify individuals who traversed structural supports. Despite being able to recognize when an individual is committing an unsafe act from videos/images, we have not been able to determine their identity. Once we can identify the person’s identity, the site managers can provide specific feedback about their unsafe behavior. Computer vision, therefore, can play a pivotal role in implementing an effective BBS program.
Several non-visual sensor techniques, for example, have been developed to recognize a person’s identity [67], [42]. Non-visual sensor-based approaches require an individual to wear sensors, but these can be expensive to install and maintain and intrusive [54]. We, therefore, develop a computer-vision approach to identify the person who performed an unsafe action automatically. Our approach provides a cost-effective solution that can be used to enable real-time safety management during construction. The contributions of our research are twofold: (1) being able to identify the individuals who commit unsafe acts with computer vision; and (2) integrating a temporal attention mechanism to remove redundant video information to obtain higher levels of accuracy and therefore recognize a person’s identity.
