Complex networks have come to penetrate many aspects of our lives, such as the internet, World Wide Web (WWW) and social networks. The internet is the infrastructure of transferring information packets which are the basic objects of various and useful network applications such as the Email, and online social activities. Therefore in recent years, great amounts of research have investigated the structure of such complex networks [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Without routing strategies packets in the internet have no fast routes to arrive at their destinations and heavy traffic congestion may occur frequently. There is common demand on navigation or routing in these artificial systems. The main goal is to achieve higher traffic capacity leading to a best packets transport with high quality and without congestion spreading in the network. Therefore three general types of scenarios have been proposed to alleviate traffic congestion and improve traffic performance; namely, designing efficient routing strategies [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], optimizing network structure [25], [26], [27], [28] and reallocating the finite network resources [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36] such as node’s delivering capacity, and link’s bandwidth.
In general these strategies can be divided in two categories: first, the local routing strategies where nodes require only neighbor or next-nearest-neighbor information, such as the local static routing [7], local dynamic routing [8] and local pheromone routing strategy [9]. While the second category is the global routing strategies where global information is needed, such as the characteristics of each node or the real-time information of each transmitted packet. Examples of this last category are: efficient path routing strategy [10], global dynamic routing strategy [11] and the shortest path strategy [12].
Epidemic spreading is another dynamical process in internet network that have been studied extensively. The focus of previous works on spreading was mainly on how the network topology affects the epidemics [37], [38]. While in the reality the virus propagation is motivated by the packets routing between computers in complex networks. In a recent work, Meloni et al. [39], attempt to incorporate traffic dynamics in epidemic spreading, and proposed another traffic-driven epidemic spreading model; in particular, they integrate the susceptible–infected–susceptible (SIS) model [40] into the shortest path routing protocol, the epidemic can spread between nodes by the transmission of packets information. At each time step a susceptible node will probably be infected if it receives new packets from its infected neighbor’s nodes. Yang et al. in [41], [42] tried to alleviate virus epidemic propagation by changing the optimal routing path in static local and global routing strategies which badly affects the network capacity. While In [43], the authors suppress the traffic-driven epidemic spreading by cutting off some edges in the network. Furthermore, O. Bamaarouf et al. [44] showed that the global routing algorithms: Efficient path [11] and global dynamics [12], favor the virus spreading more than the case where the shortest path algorithm is used and proposed a new vaccination methods to eradicate the virus propagation in these performant algorithms.
However, due to the low transmission capacity of the local routing strategies, this category of protocols has not received a great attention for a while, until recently Lin B. et al. [45] proposed a restrictive queue length algorithm (RQL) based on the idea of next-nearest neighbors (NNN) [46]. Local strategies with RQL can reach very high capacity and overcome the global routing strategies under certain circumstances.
These results comes our motivation to find out the limit of this performance, either it will not stand in term of virus propagation or it will always be satisfied. Our results have shown that the virus propagation in local protocols without additional algorithms (NNN and RQL) is very fast, due to the high roundabout of packets. While in local routing protocol under the additional algorithms (NNN and RQL) the virus propagation is reduced remarkably.
Moreover in comparison with global routing protocols, the local routing protocols under RQL surprisingly overcome the efficient path strategy regarding computer virus propagation. The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we describe models. Section 3 will be devoted to simulation results. The conclusion is given in Section 4.
