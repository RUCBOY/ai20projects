According to the Chinese “Urban Rail Transit Industry Statistics Report 2017”, by the end of 2017 the country had been operating with tunnel lengths of 3884 km, and tunnels have become an important part of China’s civil construction projects.
The TBM used in the tunnel construction of the Qingdao Metro Line 1 is characterized by a full-section and double-shield structure. The full-section ensures that the dust in the tunnel’s face does not diffuse to the working area. The double-shield has a length of 10 m, ensuring the long-distance blocking of the dust diffusion between the shield and the wall [1], [2], [3], [4]. However, during the actual construction of a tunnel, due to the extremely large amount of dust generated in the process of boring into hard rock, the surrounding rock deformation, collapses and other problems, dust will diffuse from the gaps between the shield and rock wall, belt conveyor and other locations to the working area [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Therefore, if a dust extraction system is not used, the average dust concentration during the actual tunnel construction is higher than 20 mg/m3, and even as high as 55–70 mg/m3 in some areas, of which the respirable rock dust concentration accounts for more than 40%. The high concentration of respirable rock dust can cause great harm to the human body, and can easily lead to pneumoconiosis and related diseases [11], [12], [13], [14]. Pneumoconiosis is caused due to the long-term exposure to toxic substances such as dust, and even a low concentration of dust can cause serious pneumoconiosis. Currently, there are still no effective drugs and surgical procedures to deal with such health problems and most pneumoconiosis cases can’t be cured over a person’s lifetime [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. In June 2018, the National Health Committee of China issued the “2017 China Health Development Statistics Bulletin”, including statistics on occupational disease cases in 2017. It can be seen from Fig. 1 that the incidences of pneumoconiosis are up to 22,701, accounting for 84.84% of all occupational diseases; thus it has become China's number one occupational disease. Therefore, the effective removal of tunnel construction dust has become a top priority for the safety of tunnel workers, and it is a measure that must be taken during a tunnel’s construction [20], [21], [22].Download : Download high-res image (290KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

In order to control the toxic substances such as dust in a construction tunnel effectively, dust control measures such as dust suppression by spraying, a pressurized air dust control system and a dust extraction system are used for a tunnel’s face when a TBM is being used. However, due to restrictions caused by the actual cutting conditions, the dust suppression by spraying method on the tunnel’s face remains quite ineffective, and a large amount of dust still diffuses from the tunnel’s face to the working area [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Moreover, the main function of the pressurized dust control system is to supply oxygen, and cool, dilute, and discharge exhaust gas in the working area; however, its dust control and removal effect is weak [29], [30], [31]. Finally, while the dust extraction system is designed for removing the dust within a working area, in order to remove the dust in the construction tunnel more effectively, it is important to study this system in greater detail. Accordingly, scholars from various countries have conducted a number of studies on the dust extraction system in TBM construction tunnels.
For example, Parra et al., by using developments in CFD computer simulation technology and its application in tunnels, studied the ventilation systems of three different cases within a construction tunnel. They utilized both experiments and CFD computer simulations to verify the accuracy of the CFD computer simulation’s results, and ascertained the flow patterns of different ventilation systems [32]. Moreover, Hargreaves verified that a CFD computer simulation could successfully identify the characteristics associated with various ventilation systems through both the use of a CFD computer simulation and a series of laboratory ventilation experiments, and improved the ventilation system to achieve a better dust removal effect [33]. Sasmito et al., through the application of CFD computer simulation software, compared and analyzed the airflow characteristics in a tunnel with four different turbulence models, and obtained a model more suitable for the tunnel’s ventilation system. Additionally, through a comparison of multiple ventilation methods by the use of simulation, the best arrangement of the ventilation system was chosen [34]. Kurnia et al. studied six application cases of a tunnel’s ventilation system by using CFD computer simulation technology. The airflow characteristics and dust diffusion in a tunnel with or without an auxiliary ventilation device were evaluated, with the best dust suppression method and effect obtained [35]. Furthermore, Kurnia et al. also studied the control of toxic and harmful gases and dust particles in tunnels using CFD computer simulation technology, with the optimal ventilation method and ventilation parameters obtained through an analysis of the pressurized air and dust extraction system [36]. Xu et al. reviewed the basic principles of CFD are reviewed and six turbulence models commonly used are discussed with some examples of their application and guidelines on choosing an appropriate turbulence model [37], [38], [39], [40]. Yang studied the technical plan of the ventilation system testing of the Zhongtianshan TBM construction tunnel, and tested and analyzed the influence of such tunnel parameters as the pressurized air, temperature and humidity, dust concentration, and concentration of harmful gases; this led to a determination of the effect of these parameters on the construction environment [41]. Wang et al. conducted a CFD computer simulation study on the dust movement and dust distribution of a tunnel’s ventilation system, and conducted a detailed analysis of the lateral and axial movement of the dust in the tunnel, thereby ascertaining the relationship between the dust generation rate, air velocity and dust volume, as well as discovering a better ventilation system for the tunnel [42]. Xia et al. used CFD computer simulation technology to study the influence of the position of the main vent, the length of the air baffle in the main beam and the air extraction flow rate on the flow field distribution and dust flow characteristics in a TBM tunnel, with the optimal ventilation system parameters subsequently determined [43]. Although the extant research has achieved some good results, there remain a number of shortcomings. (1) The physical model used in CFD computer simulation has been greatly simplified, which has a certain impact on the research results. (2) The effectiveness and scientificity of the parameters used in the dust extraction system of a tunnel have not yet been verified, and whether there are better parameters still needs to be ascertained. Therefore in this paper, following a comprehensive analysis of Chinese TBM construction tunnel conditions, the Wagui interval construction tunnel (Tuandao-Guizhou Road station interval) of the more typical Qingdao Metro Line 1 of China Railway Construction Corporation Limited was chosen as the study object. By combining CFD computer simulation technology with field measurements, the dust control effect of the dust extraction system in TBM tunnels under different dust extraction flow rates was studied and analyzed, with the effective range of the dust extraction flow rate obtained.
