As predicted by Moore’s law, the number of transistors per square inch on a processor doubles every 18 months [1]. Moreover, Feng coined “Moore’s law for power consumption” to describe the electricity used by computing nodes: the power consumption of compute nodes doubles every 18 months [2]. As a most significant aspect, central-processing-unit (CPU) temperatures not only affect the operational reliability [3], but also the power consumption of computers, including fan power consumption and total power consumption [4]. The computational performance and computation speeds that reduce energy use go hand in hand with reducing CPU temperature [5]. In order to further address this issue, DeVogeleer et al. [6] proposed a practical model to estimate the CPU power consumption at a given temperature with arbitrary CPU configurations. The exponential behavior is affected by, among other factors, temperature-dependent leakage currents, physical properties and the voltage regulator.
Driven by the continuous miniaturization of high-performance electronics, the dramatic increase of heat fluxes generated by semiconductor components urges the development of more effective cooling methods to ensure the reliability, stability and performance of these components [7]. As proposed by Bar-Cohen et al. [8] and Chen et al. [9], the stability and reliability of electronic chips decrease by 10% for every 2 °C increase above the permissible operating temperature. In particular, thermal management of portable electronics (for example, laptop computers) is becoming a more challenging task due to the difficulty of the problem in such a narrow space being on the order of millimeters, and ultrathin and high-performance cooling devices are urgently in demand [10].

An illustration of an ultra-slim laptop computer with cooling module [11].
As shown in Fig. 2, the power of CPU processors for laptop computers has continued to decline in the most recent 10 years. Meanwhile, in the last five years, the power of CPU processors has undergone almost no change, with a thermal design power (TDP) of 15 W (low end) to 28 W (high end). Table 1 summarizes the TDP for laptop computers, which shows that total heat loads dissipated by CPU processors are in excess of 15 W. For example, the latest Intel CPU processor, i7-8550U, has a full-load power consumption of 15 W and a configurable power load of up to 25 W [12].Download : Download high-res image (71KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2.

To efficiently cool CPU processors, two-phase passive cooling devices based on conventional heat pipes (HPs) have been widely used [13], [14], [15], [16] for laptop computers. Mochizuki et al. [13] presented a hinged HP system for cooling notebook computer CPUs. The testing results showed that the hinged HP system could dissipate 10–12 W with the CPU surface temperature below 95 °C. Nguyen et al. [14] fabricated and tested three cooling solutions using HPs for cooling a notebook PC. The results showed that at an ambient temperature of 40 °C, the cooling solutions could dissipate a maximum heat load of 13 W with a CPU surface temperature of 95 °C. To cool the Pentium processors, searches for a thermal solution were conducted by Xie et al. [15]. The results showed that two thermal solutions using HPs exhibited high heat transfer performance. Moon et al. [16] presented a miniature HP for cooling a notebook PC that could transfer a thermal load of 11.5 W with the junction temperature below 100 °C. However, owing to the heat transfer capacity limit of a single HP, for high heat fluxes and high power loading, thermal control devices may require multiple HPs or the aid of phase-change material (PCM) to meet the cooling demands, and more space is needed to integrate large cooling modules inside laptop computers. For example, Li et al. [17] proposed a novel sintered wick structure for the improvement of ultrathin HPs (UTHPs), and the effects of various parameters on the thermal performance of the UTHPs were evaluated experimentally. The results showed that the maximum heat transport capability could reach 25 W, and the thermal performance decreased rapidly with decreasing thickness. In addition, to improve the maximum heat transfer capacity for laptop computers cooling, HPs with PCM cooling modules were also studied [18], [19]. For example, Weng et al. [18] designed a HP module with PCM for electronic cooling, in which the adiabatic section of the HP was covered by a storage container with PCM, and investigated the thermal performance. The cooling module could save 46% of the fan power consumption compared with a traditional HP. However, the problems with using phase change materials are their limited heat-storage capacity and the need for additional space [20].
However, the development trends of laptop computers are faster, thinner, and lighter. For example, the thickness of the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 ultra-slim computer series has been reduced from 18.85 mm in 2012 to 15.95 mm in 2018, and the weight has been reduced from 1.347 kg to 1.13 kg, correspondingly. Another case is the Apple MacBook laptop computer, which has a total thickness of less than 13.1 mm. If the available space for cooling-module implementation is strictly limited, e.g., approximately 4–5 mm total thickness inside the chassis or less in the future, a powerful fan is required to deliver more waste heat out of laptop computers based on the conventional flattened HP configurations, which results in extra power consumption and a significant amount of noise. In this situation, novel miniature two-phase heat transfer devices with higher heat transport capacity are expected to be developed for laptop computers cooling.
A loop heat pipe (LHP), first developed in 1972 [21], is a highly effective two-phase heat transfer apparatus that uses the phase change of the working fluid to transfer heat from a heat source to a heat sink, and relies on capillary force generated in a porous wicking structure to circulate the working fluid inside the closed loop [22]. Owing to their advantages, such as the flexibility in packaging, high heat transfer capacity, low thermal resistance, and antigravity operation, many LHPs have been widely used in the thermal control of spacecraft [23], [24], electronics cooling [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], and solar-energy utilization [32], [33]. In recent decades, with the development of the microelectronics industry, application of LHPs in cooling mobile electronics, such as laptop computers or smartphones, has attracted special attention. However, because of the limited available space inside the cabinet for installing such heat transfer devices, conventional LHPs with large cylindrical evaporators may not meet the requirements of laptop computers or other portable devices. Therefore, ultrathin miniature loop heat pipe (mLHP or ULHP) coolers with flat evaporators are expected to be urgently developed and investigated.
Singh et al. [34], [35], [36] designed three different miniature loop heat pipes for compact computers and notebooks, one with a disk-shaped evaporator, 30 mm in diameter and 10 mm thick, another one with a rectangular evaporator, 45 × 35 mm plan area and 5 mm thick, and a third with a rectangular evaporator, 47 × 37 mm plan area and 5 mm thick, which showed that the potential for the compact computers cooling. Lin et al. [37] presented a miniature loop heat pipe with a 3-mm-thick rectangular evaporator for laptop PCs. The test results indicated that the mLHP could dissipate a heat load of 45 W with a heat source temperature of 63.1 °C under forced liquid cooling at the condenser side. However, the mLHPs mentioned above [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37] may not actually be installed due to the limited available space in the latest ultra-slim laptop computers if considering the extra space needed for the fins attached to the LHPs. In the Ref. [38], a 1.5-mm-thick looped type heat pipe was developed for thermal management of a power battery, but it only worked in a gravity-assisted situation, which is not feasible for laptop computers.
In the very latest review literature [39], the ultrathin micro heat pipe technologies for electronics cooling have been summarized. Presently, the publicly-reported miniaturized loop heat pipes with thickness of less than 2 mm for mobile electronics are very few. One is developed by Fujitsu Laboratories in 2015, specifically a novel ULHP with a 0.6-mm-thick evaporator for thermal management of smartphones. Compared to highly thermal conductive sheets (copper or aluminum), the ULHP exhibits approximately five times larger heat transfer capacity with a maximum heat transfer capacity of 15 W before burnout [40]. Another work is from the authors’ group [29], in which a novel copper–water miniature loop heat pipe with a flat 1.2-mm-thick evaporator and a 1.0-mm-thick condenser was designed, which has a capacity of more than 12 W at natural convection without any further heat transfer enhancement emendation. Basically, the thermal performance of a fanless ultrathin heat pipe module as illustrated in [29], [40] is very limited, which can only be aimed at less than 10 W cooling requirements [29], [39], [40].
Owing to the limited capacity of a conventional HP module and the very small size of attached fins, a dynamic fan is needed to meet the requirement of a large amount of waste heat dissipation from laptop computer CPUs, e.g., 15–28 W, as shown in Table 1. However, within 5 mm of available space height in an ultra-slim laptop computer, or even less, the complexity for the cooling module installation and the heavy fan usage will induce possible long-term failure and significant noise issues due to the very limited air flow rate from the usual small centrifugal fan. Meanwhile, even the power consumption of a laptop computer fan is very small (1–2 W), owning to the large number of laptop computers in use and their long operating time, the aggregate power consumption is still very large on a global scale. Therefore, the development of a simply-structured, ultrathin but high-performance heat dissipation module capable of handling 30 W or so with extremely low power consumption (or light fan usage) is the ideal solution for the next generation of ultra-slim laptop computers, while LHP technology could most likely meet the requirements due to its many unique advantages compared to conventional HPs as explained above. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, no such a loop heat pipe apparatus has been reported in literatures or used commercially so far.
In the present work, a unique active cooler based on a 1-mm-thick miniature loop heat pipe (mLHP), aimed at handling 30 W for a high-end ultra-slim laptop computer, was developed and tested successfully for what we believe is the first time. Its thermal characteristics, both under natural convection and forced air cooling conditions, were fully investigated. Furthermore, the effects of different test orientations and air flow velocities flowing through the condenser on the thermal performance of the proposed LHP were systemically examined by adjusting the fan voltages from 5 V to 0 V. It was found that the proposed mLHP module can work fairly well even at a 2 V fan voltage over a heat load range of 15–30 W. At the same time, a detailed theoretical model was established to provide an insight in understanding the operation mechanism of the proposed mLHP module, and also serve as a very useful guide for developing practical applications. In addition, the power consumption and the power savings were calculated based on the experimental findings. Finally, the operational performance of the proposed mLHP module in a temperature humidity chamber was evaluated and compared with the latest advanced ultrathin HP module. The results indicate that the present mLHP module is superior to the conventional HP module in the aspects of space, weight, and power savings, in addition to achieving higher cooling performances. Compared to the current ultrathin HP module applied in the latest ultra-slim laptop computers, the proposed mLHP module is approximately 11.10 g lighter, and the cooling energy consumption is reduced by 80%.
