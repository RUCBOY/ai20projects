Holography is a promising three-dimensional (3D) display technology, which can fully reproduce wave-front of a 3D object [[1], [2]]. With the development of computing technique, it has enabled the simulation of recording process for hologram generation, which is called computer generated holography (CGH) [[3], [4]]. Driven by CGH, dynamic holographic 3D display [[5], [6]] and large scale high resolution static holographic 3D display [[7], [8]] have achieved significant progress. The low bandwidth electronic devices such as spatial light modulator (SLM) are frequently used for dynamic holographic 3D display. However, the viewing angle and field of view of reconstructed 3D image are often too small for practical applications. The large size highresolution computer generated holograms such as the Fresnel hologram [8] and the color rainbow hologram [[9], [10]] are known able to produce high definition 3D effect for monochrome or colored 3D display. However, the computation of large scale high resolution hologram is time consuming despite that many algorithms have been proposed.
Holographic stereogram [[11], [12]] is another method to achieve holographic 3D display. In this method, the hogels are calculated only through approximations. Thus the selection of hogel size influences the reconstruction quality. To improve the display quality of stereogram, phase-added stereograms [[13], [14]], diffraction specific coherent panoramagram [15], and ray sampling plane techniques [16] have been introduced. A fully computed holographic stereogram was also proposed known able to reconstruct realistic 3D monochrome images [17]. However, the computational time for the hologram with size of 20 mm × 20 mm at the resolution of 20  000 × 20  000 is about 32.9 h.
In order to efficiently calculate large scale high resolution hologram, we propose a simple method to calculate the synthetic full parallax hologram based on frequency mosaic. In opposite to the stereogram method, we do not use hogel for large scale high resolution hologram calculation. The projected images of a 3D object are transformed and merged in the frequency domain. Following the transformation in the frequency domain to remove zero and negative first order information, we obtain the full-parallax synthetic hologram by encoding the inverse Fourier transform of whole frequency. Additionally, inverse Fourier transformation is only needed for effective data areas, which greatly reduces the computational time. With this method, we are able to complete the computation of a synthetic hologram with size of 30 mm × 30 mm at resolution of 94  340 × 94  340 in 72 min. The hologram is printed out by a self-made holographic printer [[10], [18]] and reconstructed with white LED by back illumination.
