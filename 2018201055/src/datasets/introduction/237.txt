Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are a class of additive brominated flame retardants (BFRs) that are ubiquitously used without chemical bound in various types of industrial and commercial products [1]. PBDEs involve 209 congeners with the chemical formula of C12H(9–0)Br(1–10)O, which consist of ten homolog groups from mono- to deca-BDEs. Penta-, octa- and deca-BDE are the three commercially produced PBDE technical mixtures [2]. As a consequence of the physicochemical properties and toxic effects of PBDEs, commercial hexa-, hepta-, tetra-, penta-BDEs and deca-BDE were classified as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) by the Stockholm Convention in 2009 and 2017, respectively [3]. Although the application of PBDEs was restricted, the side effects of PBDEs on the environment and human body will last for many years because of their presence in existing products. Many studies have verified the occurrence of PBDEs in outdoor and indoor environments [4,5], biota [6], and even in human body [7,8] worldwide. PBDEs are environmental contaminants possessing the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation [9]. Numerous studies have manifested that exposure to PBDEs was associated with endocrine dysfunction, developmental neurotoxicity and reproductive disorders [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. PBDEs were also proved to be linked to breast cancer in women [15,16]. Therefore, PBDEs exert extensive toxicities and human exposure to PBDEs is of great concern.
People spend more than 80% of their time indoors [17], where PBDEs are continuously released from the indoor decorating materials, appliances and textiles, so that people are exposed to PBDEs through indoor dust and air ingestion [18,19]. Concentrations of PBDEs in indoor dusts are higher than that in outdoors, implying that the indoor environment is a significant route of PBDE exposure to human body [20,21]. Indoor PBDEs concentration is affected by complex factors including pollution sources (e.g. electrical appliances, furniture) and the environment (e.g. temperature, ventilation) [22]. Oral ingestion, air inhalation and dermal contact are considered to be the three primary external PBDEs exposure pathways for humans [23], among which dust ingestion is one of the main routes of human exposure to PBDEs [15,22,24]. Because of the large surface area and high organic content, dust offers a medium for the transportation of PBDEs and becomes a major PBDE reservoir [25,26]. To date, researches of human exposure to PBDEs in indoor environment were mainly focused on the investigation of PBDEs in home dust [21,24,[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]], office and workplace dust [23,[35], [36], [37], [38], [39]], car dust [23,25,40], workshop dust [39,41,42], and indoor dust from e-waste recycling regions [43,44].
High levels of PBDEs in indoor dust of public environment are also a crucial and overlooked pathway for human exposure to PBDEs [22,45]. So far, however, there has been limited discussion on the occurrence and human exposure to PBDEs via indoor dust from university dormitories and printing shops. University students spend two-thirds of their time in the dormitory with narrow space and high living density. It is worth reminding that PBDEs pollution in indoor air is an order of magnitude higher than outdoor air [46,47]. The major reason is the indoor environment is complex and changeable. On the other hand, the indoor environment is connected to the outdoor air through the air convection, leading to many potential PBDEs pollution sources in the outdoor entering the indoor [22,48]. At the same time, due to the popularization of electronic products such as computers and mobile phones among university students, as well as the slow release of PBDEs in the building and decoration materials of university dormitories, PBDEs ingestion from these pollution sources will endanger the health of university students. Nonetheless, studies on PBDE levels in university environments are rarely reported [32,[49], [50], [51], [52]], and no study is available on PBDE concentration in university dormitory. Therefore, it is urgent to pay attention to the research on the pollution characteristics of PBDEs in university dormitory and the health effects of PBDEs exposure to university students in dormitory environment. In addition, previous studies have shown that indoor PBDEs are sensitive to their discharge from the use of electrical appliances [53]. Typically, printing shops have many electronic equipment, including printers and computers, which are products containing PBDEs. PBDEs in these electronic devices are constantly released into and contaminated the air and dust in the printing shop. As a result, PBDEs in indoor dust produced by electronic equipment are of significant risk to humans. However, no research has been found that surveyed the contamination level of PBDEs and the risk of human exposure to PBDEs in printing shops, a public environment with more electronic equipment.
Consequently, to reveal PBDE concentrations and assess human exposure risk of PBDEs in indoor dust from public environment, especially in university dormitories and printing shops, the primary purposes of this study were (1) to investigate and compare the concentrations and compositional features of PBDEs in indoor dusts from university dormitories and printing shops; (2) to analyze the sources of PBDEs and the factors affecting PBDE levels; (3) to compare PBDE levels in indoor dust worldwide; (4) to reveal the estimated daily intake (EDI) of PBDEs in indoor dust via dust ingestion.
