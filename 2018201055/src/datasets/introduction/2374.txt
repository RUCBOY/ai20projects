Covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] are especially attractive as hydrogen storage amid various functional porous materials media because of its tunable pore size, the lighter atomic weight of constituent elements, the larger specific surface area and so on. At present, the studies on COFs based hydrogen storage are mainly focused on two areas: exploring the hydrogen storage properties of existing COFs or modifying COFs to enhance their hydrogen storage properties. For example, Furukawa and Yaghi systematically measured the hydrogen storage isotherms of a series of typical COFs at both 77 K and 298 K in experiment [6]. Using GCMC simulation, Garberoglio computed the hydrogen adsorption capacities of several COFs and found the selected COFs can store much more hydrogen gas than metal organic frameworks [7]. Xiang et al. found that lithium-decorating approach can enhance the hydrogen adsorption capacity of a new synthesized covalent organic polymer to the extent of 70.4% compared with its unmodified counterpart in experiment [8]. Also, Xia et al. functionalized the structure of COF-302 by substituting the hydrogen atoms of benzene rings with a series of substituent groups, including OH, Cl, NO2, NH2, CH3, and CN [9]. Remarkably, the NH2 replaced COF-302 can improve the H2 storage capacity by 27.6% at 298 K and 35.2% at 77 K. At the same time, some studies have reported that the COFs or their modified counterparts may have good reversible gas storage capacity [6], [10], [11], [12]. All these investigations forecast the broad prospects of COFs in hydrogen storage field. Unfortunately, none of the existing COFs or their modified compounds can satisfy all the targets for commercialized hydrogen storage application [13]. Thereupon, some researchers begin to put their efforts into synthesizing or designing novel COFs with various structures both in experiment and in theory.
Computer-aided material design can not only save a lot of time and efforts but also make the design process more targeted. Hence, many novel COFs with specific goals have been designed under the help of computer simulation. Typically, Mendoza-Cortes computationally designed 14 new COFs and studied their methane adsorption properties at 298 K and 300 bar [14]. Using computer-aided design, Babarao et al. assembled several imine-linked 3D COFs with diamondoid structures based on tetrakis-4-formylphenylsilane as the node and 3R,4R-diaminotetrahydrofuran as linker and predicted their CO2 adsorption properties in theory [15]. Amirjalayer et al. proposed a theoretical method to predict structures in various framework topologies for all existing boron based COFs [16]. The results showed a high degree of consistency between their theoretical method and the corresponding experiment. Also, Bureekaew and Schmid employed a global minimum search approach based on automated genetic algorithm and a reverse topological approach to predicted various possible 3D-COFs [17]. All these investigations provide useful references and excellent inspirations for exploring the novel structures and specific properties of COFs.
Motivated by these vivid examples, we predict the structure and H2 adsorption properties of four new COFs based on tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)silsesquioxane (TAPS) as the tetrahedral node and three anhydrides as the linkers. For brevity, we term the TAPS based COFs as taps-COFs. Silsesquioxane, owning the general chemical formula of (RSiO3/2)n, (n = 4, 6, 8, …), is one kind of compounds with the rigid structure of nanoscopic cages [18], [19], [20], [21]. Since the R groups are reactive and prone to polymerization, the silsesquioxanes are perfect building blocks for assembling new COFs [19], [22], [23]. For example, several novel porous framework materials have been synthesized based on R8Si8O12 with specific net topologies under various conditions in experiment [24], [25], [26], [27]. The TAPS might be generated by nitrifying the tetraphenyl silsesquioxane (TPS), (C6H5)4Si4O6, with a sequence of reaction processes reported before [28], [29]. The new porous materials may be constructed based on TAPS and other linkers through polymerization further. In this respect, we predict four new taps-COFs with the aid of computer simulation in present work. In parallel, we propose the probable methods to synthesize the four novel COFs at the end of this manuscript.
Design and simulation methodsAs depicted in Fig. 1, four taps-COFs materials are designed under the net topologies of dia (diamond structure with space group of Fd3¯m), ctn (a hypothetical C3N4 structure with space group of I4¯3m) and bor (boracite structure with space group of P4¯3m) with the TPS as tetrahedral node and A, B, C as linkers. Fig. 1 displays that tapsCOF1 and tapsCOF2 are assembled with the guide of diamond structure by replacing the tetrahedral nodes with TPS and CC bond with A and B, while tapsCOF3 and tapsCOF4 can be constructed under the net topologies of ctn and bor with TPS as the tetrahedral node and C as triangular linker, respectively. Before design these taps-COFs, four building units were first optimized using density function theory. Based on the optimized building units, the taps-COFs were preliminarily designed by inserting the building units into the corresponding place of topology nets. Subsequently, four taps-COF frameworks were further optimized with the method of classical molecular mechanics theory and the COMPASS force field [30], [31]. The COMPASS force field was parameterized by the ab initio calculations and had been successfully employed to predict the structures and properties of various materials in cluster or condensed phases. The optimized process was started with the method of steepest descent method to accelerate convergence and then the best structures were gained with the method of conjugate gradient. During the process, all the structural parameters were freely optimized without any symmetry constraints imposed on these frameworks and the energy convergence criterion is chosen as 1.0 × 10−5 kcal/mol and the forces convergence criterion on each atom are less than 0.001 kcal/(mol·Å).Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. The design scheme of four taps-COFs based on TPS as tetrahedral node and A, B, C as linkers.After the structural optimization, the GCMC simulation was adopted to predict the H2 adsorption properties of these designed taps-COFs. The 6–12 Lennard-Jones (6-12 L-J) potential depicted in Eq. (1) was employed to describe the van der Waals interactions between the adsorbate molecules and the taps-COFs. The united-atom model is adopted to describe the H2 molecule, where Buch gives the potential parameters [32]. The potential parameters for C, H, O, N and Si in frameworks are described by the DREIDING force field put forward by Mayo et al. [33]. Table S1 in Supplementary Material lists the corresponding potential parameters used here. The Lorentz-Berthelot mixing rules depicted in Eqs. (2), (3) are implemented to calculate the potential parameters between two different types of atoms.(1)ULJ=−4εij[(σijrij)6−(σijrij)12](2)σij=(σii+σjj)/2(3)εij=εiiεjjThe hydrogen adsorption processes of four taps-COFs were simulated by GCMC using the code MuSic [34]. During the simulations, the structures of the frameworks are extended to 2 × 2 × 2 supercells with periodic boundaries and are treated as rigid unmoved frameworks with frozen atoms. The 6-12 L-J interactions between H2 molecule and the framework atoms were evaluated with a spherical cut-off value of 13.0 Å. Every typical GCMC simulation point contained 2 × 107 trial steps with three equiprobable trial moves including random insertion, translation or deletion of a H2 molecule. The first half moves of each step were rejected since they were used for ensemble equilibration and the ensemble averages were obtained by the second half of the moves.
