Schrödinger equation is one of the most fundamental equations in quantum mechanics. It describes states of particles governed by quantum mechanical laws under the non-relativistic regime. Solving the Schrödinger equation of atoms and molecules is one of the ultimate goals in chemistry and physics. However, as Dirac claimed in 1929, exact application of mathematical theories to solve the Schrödinger equations leads to equations too complicated to be soluble [1]. In fact, the number of variables to be determined in full configuration interaction (full-CI) method grows exponentially against the system size, and it easily runs into astronomical figures.
In 1982, Feynman suggested that the simulation of systems obeying quantum mechanical principles can be efficiently performed on computers built by quantum mechanical elements, namely quantum computers (QCs), instead of the classical counterparts [2]. QCs are capable of performing certain calculations exponentially faster than the classical counterparts, by making use of the quantum superposition and entanglement of quantum states [3]. Examples of the applications of QCs are prime factorization of large integers [4], finding eigenvalues and eigenvectors of observables [5], solving systems of linear equations [6], and homology analysis of big data [7], and so on.
An approach to calculate full-CI energies of atoms and molecules on QCs was first proposed by Aspuru-Guzik and coworkers in 2005 [8]. Since then, many theoretical and experimental studies of the “quantum chemical calculations on quantum computers” (QCC-on-QCs) have been reported [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. The approach proposed by Aspuru-Guzik et al. is based on the Trotter decomposition and quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA) [5] as discussed below with Gaussian basis sets, and the computation scales O(Norb11) in the upper bound (O(Norb9) in the empirical base) [13], where Norb denotes the number of spin orbitals. The scaling of time complexity and circuit depth have been improved more and more, by utilizing truncated Taylor-series [43] or Qubitization [44] techniques for Hamiltonian simulation instead of Trotterization, utilization of plane wave basis sets instead of Gaussian type functions, and so on [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. It should be noted that quantum–classical hybrid computation systems known as a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) have attracted attention in the realm of QCC-on-QCs [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28] for near-future applications. Experimental demonstrations of the potential energy curve calculations of BeH2 molecule have been reported recently [25].
In the QPEA-based full-CI calculations, the time evolution of a wave function |Ψ〉 under an electronic Hamiltonian H is simulated as in Eq. (1), reading out the eigenphase ϕ in terms of inverse quantum Fourier transformation.(1)exp-iHt|Ψ〉=exp-iEt|Ψ〉=exp-i2πϕ|Ψ〉
The simplest way to map the wave function |Ψ〉 onto quantum devices is a direct mapping (DM) [8], in which each qubit represents the occupation number of a particular spin orbital (|1〉 if the spin orbital is occupied, otherwise |0〉). The electronic Hamiltonian is written in the second quantized form as in Eq. (2), and creation and annihilation operators are decomposed into products of Pauli operators by adopting Jordan–Wigner transformation (JWT) as given in Eqs. (3), (4), respectively.(2)H=∑prhprar†ap+∑pqrswpqrsar†as†aqap(3)ar†=1〉〈0⊗∏i<rσiZ(4)ap=|0〉〈1|⊗∏i<pσiZ
The sequential σz operators in Eqs. (3), (4) are required to satisfy the fermionic anti-commutation relations of creation/annihilation operators, namely parity of wave functions. Note that the wave function mapping based on DM and JWT stores occupancy locally and parity nonlocally, and therefore nonlocal qubit operators are required for manipulating fermionic states. Locality of the quantum operations can be improved by using Bravyi–Kitaev transformation (BKT) [45] instead of JWT [32]. The other mapping approaches such as compact mapping [8] and Bravyi–Kitaev superfast (BKSF) encoding [33] are also available.
In most cases, we need to calculate the wave functions and energies of molecules in their electronic ground state. The QPEA in Eq. (1) gives the full-CI energy of the ground state with the probability proportional to the square of the overlap between the wave function used for QPEA and the full-CI wave function of the ground state, |〈Ψ|Ψfull-CI〉|2. If the overlap is exponentially small, an exponential number of QPEA experiments are required to obtain the correct ground state, which spoils advantages of the quantum speedup. In this context, development of efficient methods for preparing the initial guess wave functions having sufficiently large overlap with the ground state full-CI wave function is crucial. The Hartree–Fock wave function |ΨHF〉 is generally a good initial guess in typical closed shell singlet molecules around their equilibrium geometry. Noticeably, for open shell systems carrying unpaired electrons of spin-β, however, the wave function inevitably has a strong multi-determinantal character to satisfy the symmetry requirement of the spin operator S2, and the overlap between |ΨHF〉 and |Ψfull-CI〉 decays exponentially as the number of possible spin configurations increases. The number of spin configurations amounts to NCNβ, where N and Nβ represent the numbers of unpaired electrons and those of spin-β, respectively. Throughout the present work, it should be noted that we use the term “open shell systems” not only for molecules carrying unpaired electrons in their electronic ground state such as oligoradicals and single molecule magnets but also for molecules having sizable open shell characters and whose static electron correlations are prominent. Molecules undergoing covalent bond cleavages are representatives of such open shell systems, and the calculations of open shell electronic structures are essential in recent advances of chemistry.
In the previous study, we have demonstrated that the configuration state function (CSF) that is a simultaneous eigenfunction of SZ and S2 operators (a spin eigenfunction) is easy-to-prepare good initial guesses for the QPEA-based full-CI of open shell molecules, and we have proposed a quantum circuit to prepare a CSF of the N-spin systems, paving the way for quantum chemical calculations of molecules having open shell electronic structures on QCs [37]. The algorithm is based on the addition theorem of angular momentum, and importantly we have shown that the required qubit operations are composed of only Nβ of one-qubit rotations and Nβ2 of CNOT gates. The proposed quantum circuit consists of only single qubit rotations and CNOT gates, and has a very simple structure. However, the circuit contains many CNOT gates acting on non-adjacent qubits, and the circuit depth is 2Nβ. From the viewpoint of physical implementations, it is preferable to construct the quantum circuits of constant circuit depth without distant two qubit gates.
In this work, we focus on an alternative and improved approach for the addition of angular momentum, which is known as a “Serber construction” to prepare CSFs on QCs in a more efficient manner than the previously proposed one. By adopting Serber construction, the number of the CNOT operations is reduced to Nβ, and all the CNOT operations are applied to adjacent qubits. The circuit depth is constant 2 in the present approach, and therefore the cost of the CSF preparation is negligible compared with Hamiltonian simulations and QPEA.
