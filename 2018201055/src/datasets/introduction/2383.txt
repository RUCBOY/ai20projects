Calreticulin (CRT), characterized as a molecular chaperone, is predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), but also present in the nuclear envelope, nucleus, cytoplasm, cell membrane surface, and even in the extracellular matrix [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. CRT and proteins′ interaction is found in various intracellular and extracellular biological processes. CRT exists in ER, together with homologous protein calnexin(CNX), and is involved in the folding and quality control of glycoproteins synthesis and suppress the thermal aggregation of both glycosylated and non-glycosylated proteins [6]. CRT expressed at the cell surface also plays a vital role in the immunogenic cell death by involving the immune regulation relying on the interaction with various immune receptors [7], [8], [9] (TLRs, CD91 and TCRs). The binding of CRT to FasL (factor associated suicide ligand) can inhibit FasL–FasL binding in vivo, thereby playing an essential role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) inhibition and treatment [10]. The recent works exhibit CRT interaction with integrins in cell adhesion, which is a necessary process for cancer metastasis [11]. Besides, the characterized CRT mutants and MPL (thrombopoietin receptor) interaction have advanced our knowledge of the functional role of CRT in thrombocythemia [12]. In brief, the investigation of CRT and proteins′ interaction is significant to understand the mechanism and improve the treatment of cancer and other diseases. Therefore, it is vital to establish effective methods to investigate CRT and proteins′ interactions.
So far, the available methods employed co-immunoprecipitation [13], [14], [15], solid phase assays [16], [17] and SPR [18] to validate the interaction of CRT with proteins. However, they are accompanied by several limitations. The co-immunoprecipitation and solid phase assays require multi-step incubation; SPR involves protein's covalent immobilizing to the sensor chip, which hinders the interaction to occur in physiological free solution.
Capillary electrophoresis (CE), a microanalytical technique with simultaneous high efficient separation and sensitive detection, is applicable for bioanalysis, interaction and affinity assessment. For example, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and Bcl2-associated anthanogene 3 (Bag3) complex was identified by CZE-LIF [19]; the affinity of human serum albumin (HSA) and an anti-HSA polyclonal antiserum was assessed by CZE-LIF [20]; the affinity of EGFR and the EGa1 nanobody was assessed by ACE-UV [21]; the binding constants (Kb) of specific Abs against bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the healthy prion protein (PrPc) were determined by ACE-UV and CZE-UV [22]. Our group has been engaged in the investigation of multiple modes CE application in the interaction studies of proteins and ssDNA [23]，proteins and PNA [24] as well as a selection of aptamers selection against various targets [23], [25] based on their interaction for many years.
In this work, we firstly demonstrate CE utilization in the CRT analysis and characterization of its interaction with IgG and HSA. CZE-UV, CZE-LIF and ACE-UV were used to identify the interactions and evaluate their binding affinities. The results showed that CRT interacts with IgG with nanomolar Kd, well consistent with the reported ELISA [26]. CRT did not interact with HSA, which agrees with the report of C. Svaerke and G. Houen by ELISA and immunoblotting [27]. Besides, the CE provided rapid analysis in less than 6 min, and its sample volume consumption was very low and ultimately is very cost effective. To validate the CRT and IgG binding, we demonstrated the possible binding sites on CRT for IgG interaction by molecular docking, which extends an opportunity to further understanding of CRT interaction with other proteins.
