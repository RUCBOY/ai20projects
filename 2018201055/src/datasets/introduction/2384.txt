The assessment of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures has become increasingly important to evaluate, monitor and improve the quality of cancer care [1], [2], [3]. One of the most frequently used PRO measures for cancer patients is the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life core questionnaire QLQ-C30 [4], [5]. It consists of 30 items covering five multi-item function scales (physical, role, social, cognitive and emotional function), three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain), six single-item scales assessing further aspects of HRQoL (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhoea and financial difficulties) and a scale on overall health/HRQoL.
The QLQ-C30 has been evaluated in many different cancer populations, and adequate psychometric properties were largely supported [6]. However, some studies found floor and ceiling effects [7], [8]. Also, it is a well-known limitation of traditional HRQoL questionnaires, such as the QLQ-C30, that some questions might be irrelevant to the patient, which potentially increases respondent burden and results in less precise score estimates [9]. A promising solution to overcome such limitations is the use of computer-adaptive tests (CATs). CAT is methodologically based on item response theory (IRT). Using IRT, domain-specific item banks (i.e. lists of items measuring the same domain) can be calibrated on a common scale [9], [10]. Fitting an IRT model provides item parameters that reflect the statistical relationship between an individual's response to a given item and his/her position on a domain scale. A major advantage of using IRT for scoring is that any item subset of an item bank can be used to estimate a person's domain score on the same continuous metric [11]. This enables CATs, in which HRQoL assessment is tailored to the individual, which increases measurement precision and range while reducing respondent burden, sample size requirements and study costs [10], [12], [13].
In 2006, the EORTC Quality of Life Group started developing the EORTC CAT Core, which is based on domain-specific item banks measuring the same dimensions as the QLQ-C30 [14], [15]. In the item bank development process, different sources of information were collated, including literature reviews, qualitative input from various stakeholders and psychometric analyses of large international samples of cancer patients [14]. Item bank development for all domains was completed in 2016 [12], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. To calibrate items of each bank, IRT models were estimated using data obtained from these clinical samples [22]. After item calibration, parameters are based on a z-score metric with a study population mean of 0 and standard deviation (SD) of 1. Such scores are ‘arbitrary’, hampering interpretation. Thus, the next step of item calibration is to link the CAT algorithm to general population norm data to simplify score interpretation. In this final step, it has become common practice to transform scores to a T-score metric with a general population mean of 50 (SD = 10).
The EORTC CAT Core development did not include this final step of transforming scores to T-scores. Therefore, for a more meaningful and sensible score interpretation, this study aimed at collecting representative data of the European general population to transform the current scoring to a T-score metric. Any score obtained via the EORTC CAT Core can then be interpreted in relation to this European mean. In addition, CAT norm scores are established for sex-, age- and country-specific subpopulations.
