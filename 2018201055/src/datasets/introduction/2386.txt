Advancements in neuroimaging techniques including the electroencephalography (EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have led to the emergence of mind reading and the brain-computer interface (BCI) [1]. The BCI is a direct communication methodology between the brain and machines based on detection of neural activities [2]. This technology enables the control of computers or machines via human thought [3] as well as machines that respond to the emotional states of individuals [4].
Most BCI studies have used noninvasive decoders via EEGs; this approach is less expensive and more appropriate for healthy individuals [5,6]. EEG-based BCI techniques have successfully been used for the control of cursors [[7], [8], [9]], robotic arms [[10], [11], [12]], humanoid robots [13,14], and drones [15,16]. They have decoded the emotional states of individuals to control robotic systems and suitably respond to them [4,[17], [18], [19]].
For instance, remarkable studies by Wolpaw and colleagues have successfully translated sensorimotor rhythms obtained from conventional 64-channel EEG recording systems and applied them to two- [7] and three-dimensional [8] cursor movements on a computer screen using adaptive algorithms and a large Laplacian filter. LeFleur et al. proposed BCI control systems for drones in three-dimensional space using motor imagery signals and 64-channel EEG systems [15]. In addition, we have successfully demonstrated more practical BCI control systems for humanoid robots in two-dimensional space using motor imagery signals and 32-channel EEG systems [13]. While these BCI systems have been developed based on classifications of sensorimotor rhythms during a motor imagery task [[20], [21], [22]], other BCI systems have focused on predicting the motion trajectory [3,11] or recognizing the user's cognitive states [4,17,[23], [24], [25]]. For example, Kim et al. used inexpensive 16-channel EEGs with the hybrid BCI/eye-tracker system to classify the attention levels of BCI users to control a drone in three-dimensional space [16].
However, it is quite difficult to decode the intention of the BCI users using the EEG because the EEG has lower spatial resolutions and less information content due to involvement of a large size of neuronal populations relative to neuroimaging tools [[26], [27], [28]]. Thus, most previous BCI studies have utilized well-defined electrical signals of the brain such as event-related potentials or motor imagery signals [29]. For example, brain signals elicited during the motor imagery of the left or right hand are used as a command signal for “move to the left” or “move to the right” for the robotic drone, respectively. Signals for the motor imagery of both hands can be used as a “move forward” command similar to the signals from joysticks to induce movement. In essence, these methods monitor the sensorimotor rhythms from the motor cortex and compare their power spectra between left and right regions of the brain during the performance of a motor imagery task [27].
In addition, conventional EEG recording systems are too large and heavy, and utilize particularly uncomfortable protocols involving wet electrodes. Recently, less-expensive and portable EEG systems such as OpenBCI, EMOTIV, and NeuroSky have become available, but they have lower sampling rates, worse signal-to-noise ratios, and fewer channels than conventional EEG recording systems. This impedes their ability to decode the sensorimotor rhythms and thus the intention of the BCI user.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a novel EEG decoder for BCI applications of movement control that can classify the user intention of movement directions using an inexpensive EEG recording system. In this study, we investigated the potential usefulness of the echo state network. The echo state network analyzes and predicts nonlinear time series yet has very simple learning rules for readouts [30]. Here, we used the readouts with Gaussian properties to represent movement directions. An EMOTIV EPOC + system was used as a portable and inexpensive EEG recording system to record EEG signals in 14 channels to directly read subjects’ intention of movement directions rather than imagery movement of their bodies.
