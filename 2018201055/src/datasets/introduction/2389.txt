With the diffusion of social networking platforms, the social and information seeking-related human behaviors have been affected by the “new” environment. Information seeking increasingly takes place on social media platforms, relying on what a users' contacts and followed pages share (Zubiaga, Liakata, Procter, Hoi, & Tolmie, 2016).
Because of this filtering and selection, the users' knowledge-building process could be severely biased and polarized.
For example, a study shows that 72% of participants (college students) trusted links sent by friends, even if they contained phishing attempts (Jagatic, Johnson, Jakobsson, & Menczer, 2007).
The recent debate on fake news, highlighted the potential link between the increase in their spread, and the structure of social networks as well as their embedded algorithms, which turned these environments into “echo chambers”, in which users are selectively exposed to information, and tend to filter the information in order to reinforce their positions (confirmation bias), rather than to find alternatives (Del Vicario et al., 2016).
These factors highlight the importance of studying the effects of social influence within computer-mediated-communication, in order to understand which environmental factors can enhance its effects.
Social norms exist also in online environments, but the users' perception of them can be different according to the platform, to anonymity and the social ties among contacts. Therefore, compliance to social norms can emerge in different ways, than those observable in face-to-face interaction.
Also, information-seeking behavior can be affected by online environments: on one side we observe its interrelation with social norms, especially when it takes place on social media platforms, and users gather information on the basis of what they read on their personal newsfeed. However, we also observe how users can rely on opinions expressed by unknown actors, as it happens on platforms like TripAdvisor.
The present study, using online experiments, aims to separate norms-oriented social influence from information-oriented social influence, in order to observe which elements and environmental factors have an effect on both typologies and which are peculiar for each.
1.1. Theoretical frameworkA major understanding on the functioning of social influence came about thanks to the pioneering works of Sherif (1937) and then Asch (1951, 1955, 1956). The authors studied how the physical presence of other people can lead experimental subjects to conform their judgment to the one of the others. They used two different types of tasks: while in Asch conformity experiments, guessing the correct answer could be straightforward (Asch, 1955, 1956; Asch & Guetzkow, 1951), Sherif used the autokinetic effect, so a more ambiguous task, to test the effects of social influence (Sherif, 1937). From these experiments, two typologies of social influence have been identified, called “normative” when people conform in order to satisfy a need to belong and comply to social norms, as observed in Asch's experiments, and “informational” when the subjects lack on information in order to perform a task, as observed in the autokinetic experiment (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955). According to this theorization proposed by Deutsch and Gerard (1955), we can say that we are able to observe normative social influence in Asch's conformity experiments, because the task is relatively easy and the subjects, when interviewed after taking part to the experiment stated that they were able to spot the correct answer, but conform in order not to break the social norms and be group outsiders. Instead, given that the task presented in the autokinetic experiment is more ambiguous, as it is based on a visual illusion, in this case we can say that subjects conform because they are unsure on how to proceed.While, as observed in these classical studies, to elicit conformity in face-to-face situations, the physical presence of other people and being exposed to their judgment can be enough, things go differently when people interact online, especially for normative social influence.Indeed, it is still unclear which elements can have the power to lead people to conform during computer-mediated-communication.Deindividuation, namely the diminished perception of one's personal traits (Zimbardo, 1969), has been identified as a potential key element in the discourse on normative influence.The original deindividuation model was proposed by Zimbardo in 1969, and the author identified a series of variables that according to him can lead to a deindividuation state. The variables considered by Zimbardo are for example anonymity, arousal, sensory overload, novel or unstructured situations, involvement in the act, and the use of altering substances (Zimbardo, 1969). Several other authors suggest that if people interact while being in a deindividuation state, normative social influence can disappear (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Latané, 1981; Lott & Lott, 1965; Short, Williams, & Christie, 1976). This happens because there is not the possibility to identify the interlocutors, due to a lack of actual or perceived proximity, and consequently, deindividuation should lighten the pressure to act according to social norms (Latané, 1981).Furthermore, a study which tested antinormative behavior by counterposing deindividuation to the presence of an explicit aggressive social norm, showed that subjects were actually more aggressive when deindividuated, rather than when exposed to the explicit norm, so in this case, deindividuation resulted to be more powerful in leading to antinormative behavior (Mann, Newton, & Innes, 1982).A significant advancement in explaining the functioning of normative social influence in online environments is represented by the contribution provided by the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects (SIDE Model), that takes the concept of deindividuation and expands it, explaining its link and implications on social influence in online environments (Spears, Postmes, Lea, & Wolbert, 2002).The authors theorize that deindividuation is indeed likely to occur in online environments, but it can become a powerful tool to trigger conformity: given that while deindividuated, subjects have a diminished perception of their personal traits, if the group the subjects are interacting with is made salient, then the subjects will be more likely to conform (Spears, Postmes, & Lea, 2018).This happens because combining a lack of relevance of one's personality with an enhancement of the importance of the interlocutors, will lead the subjects to identify at the group level, and consequently to comply to the social norms. The experimental results seem to confirm the predictions presented by the SIDE Model (Lee, 2004; Postmes, Spears, Sakhel, & De Groot, 2001), but it is not clear what happens when users are deindividuated but the group saliency is not enhanced.On the matter of informational influence during computer-mediated-communication instead, studies have focused on different aspects.As aforementioned, a visible example of informational influence in online environments is represented by users making choices on the basis of reviews or ratings provided by other unknown users while using platforms such as Tripadvisor, Uber or Airbnb (Liu & Zhang, 2010), but other examples show that it can take place easily also in other ways.A study conducted by Rosander and Eriksson (2012), shows that users facing a general knowledge quiz in which they were exposed to histograms showing the distribution of the answers provided by other unknown users, conformed in high percentages (52%).While many studies on online consumers behavior focused on factors such as the perceived importance of feedback (Liu & Zhang, 2010) on informational influence, or on the conjunct effect of informational and normative influence on behavior when subjects interact without personal contact (LaTour & Manrai, 1989), no study tried to isolate it, and point out the environmental factors that could be able to enhance or diminish the compliance of users in this case. Furthermore, no study tested the effects of deindividuation on informational influence.In order to test and fulfill the predictions developed based on the literature, we developed an experimental framework aiming to study separately the two typologies of social influence during computer-mediated-communication.On one side, we reduced group saliency to test how deindividuation works on both typologies of social influence and controlled the possible interactions between some psychological dimensions and the operative variables.On the other side, we calculated the items entropy to test if task ambiguity increases informational-based compliance. The environmental factors that we decided to manipulate and study in relation to both typologies of social influence are anonymity and physical isolation, as their combination can trigger deindividuation.
1.2. Overview and predictionsTo test online normative influence, we replicated Asch's conformity experiment (Asch, 1955, 1956; Asch & Guetzkow, 1951) on a web-based platform, while to test online informational influence we created two linguistic tasks of increasing ambiguity, designed adopting the same structure of the “classical” Asch's items. Task ambiguity was measured by calculating the items' entropy, and in this way, we were able to assess the subjects' lack of information. The diversity of the tasks, allowed us to measure the interaction between anonymity, physical isolation, and degree of ambiguity, in relation to the behavior of the experimental subjects. Considering the literature, we could formulate the following predictions:•H1) Diminished effectiveness of normative influence due to the combination of a deindividuation state given by anonymity and physical isolation, and minimum levels of group saliency, as theorized by several authors (Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Latané, 1981; Lott & Lott, 1965; Short et al., 1976) and hypothesized by the SIDE Model (Postmes et al., 2001).•H2) There is no specific evidence to build on, on the potential relationship between deindividuation and informational influence (if separated by normative influence), but we expect it to have the same inhibitory effect it has on normative influence (Lee, 2007). The effect of the anonymity and physical isolation variables alone will also be controlled.•H3) We expect a positive correlation between conformity and task ambiguity, given that with more ambiguous items the subjects will possess less information on how to handle the task, and might rely on other people's judgment (Cialdini & Trost, 1998; Rosander & Eriksson, 2012).We also controlled the interaction of personality and psychological traits on conformity. In order to make sure that the analyzed effects were relatable to the manipulated features and not to particular psychological traits, we measured the psychological dimensions that according to literature, result related to some extent to conformity. Only a few studies analyzed the relation between conformity and personality traits, suggesting some interesting connections between social conformity and Emotional Stability, Agreeableness and Closeness (DeYoung, Peterson, & Higgins, 2002). So we expect that:•H4) Factors as Neuroticism, Surgency (a trait linked to Extraversion) and Closeness will have an inhibitory effect on conformity•H5) Agreeableness will increase the tendency to yield to majority pressure.However, it is necessary to consider the contextual peculiarities, illustrated by both the deindividuation explanation provided by literature (Latané, 1981; Postmes et al., 2001; Tsikerdekis, 2013), and the theoretical framework supporting the idea that real and virtual identities are not consistent (Kim & Sherman, 2007), that highlight the lack of saliency of personality traits in anonymity conditions, which may predict a:•H6) weak general effect of personality traits, especially if measured with scales calibrated to assess “real life” traits.Finally, since the experiment was conducted both in group and single (i.e., physical isolation) conditions, according to the existing literature that illustrates how the mere presence of other people can affect an individual's performance (Markus, 1978), we expect:•H7) Physical isolation and group conditions to produce significantly different behavioral outcomes.
