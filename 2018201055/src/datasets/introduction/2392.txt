Human–computer interfaces (HCIs) based on bioelectrical signals have received increasing attention over the last decade [1]. Common types of HCI bio-signals include electromyography, electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography, and functional near-infrared spectroscopy [2]. EEG is one of the most common techniques. EEG is a method for measuring the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes placed on the scalp [[3], [4], [5]]. EEG is a noninvasive tool that can provide high temporal resolution to directly represent the dynamics of brain activities. EEG has been widely used for both medical diagnoses and neurobiological research. Recent research has opened up the possibility for its use in novel brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) focused on enhancing the performance of healthy users.
Traditionally data collection for EEG based BCIs uses wet Ag/AgCl electrodes that are uncomfortable and require considerable time to apply [6]. To improve the performance of conventional Ag/AgCl electrodes, gel-less electrodes has been designed. Gel-less electrodes include micro-needle, tips, spring pin, and soft conductive polymer. The most common candidate used for these needle array electrodes has been micromachined silicon needles, fabricated through wet-chemical etching methods and then coated with a biocompatible conducting coating. a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) has been used with dry MEMS electrodes to measure EEG signals [7]. This dry electrode is designed to pierce the stratum corneum into the electrically conducting tissue layer stratum germinativum. Radhakrishnan has designed a needle array dry electrode, which has a 10*10 array of stainless steel microtips assembled over a Teflon base of 1 cm diameter [8]. MEMS electrodes can acquire EEG signals without conductive gels, but MEMS electrodes can't penetrate hair [9,10]. In addition to the needle electrode, noncontact capacitive electrodes can be used [11,12]. However, noncontact capacitive electrodes are affected by motion artifacts. other kind of dry electrode is made of conductive rubber [13,14], metal (just like iridium-oxide [15] or silver [16]) and polyurethanes(TPU) [17,18]. Some designe have been applied to brain computer interface. We think that the use of a metal dry electrode is also a good method.
In the classification part, many traditional classifiers like support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [19], and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) [20] that have been employed in research and pattern recognition techniques are utilized for EEG signal detection. Common spatial patterns (CSPs) are widely used in motor imagery (MI) tasks [21]. Other methods, like independent component analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) have been used to improve classification accuracy [19]. In recent years, many machine learning researchers have focused on deep neural networks, which have been improved with backpropagation neural networks, including deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), autoencoders, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks [[22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]].
CNN is artificial neural networks that can learn local patterns in data by using convolutions as their key component. CNN vary in the number of convolutional layers, ranging from convolutional layer such as in a successful handwritten recognition CNN [28] over deep CNN with multiple convolutional layers (5 convolutional layers and 3 full connection layers) [29] to very deep architectures with more than 1000 layers as in the case of the recently developed residual networks [30]. Now CNNs are also used in MI classification research [2]. Some research uses different methods to convert the EEG signal to an image representation before applying the CNN. In a report, Pouya et al. proposed a novel approach to learning such representations for a multi-channel EEG time series, and demonstrated its advantages in the context of a mental load classification task [31]. EEG activities were transformed into a sequence of topology-preserving multi-spectral images. In another report, Yang et al. proposed a frequency complementary feature map selection scheme by constraining the dependency between frequency bands [32]. Augmented common spatial pattern (ACSP) features were generated based on pair-wise projection matrices, which covered various frequency ranges. In some studies, the input form of CNN has 2-dimension, time dimension was first dimension, and the channel was second dimension [[33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]]. Other studies used 2-dimension input form, but frequency was first dimension, and time was second dimension by Short Time Fourier Transform [39,40].
In this study, we design a wireless, portable EEG system based on dry EEG sensors, with an embedded system that prevents channel connection and fixation. We proposed a system with a small size of 3*4 cm, which was attached to headphones. Traditional BCI systems require the use of an EEG cap, however, the cap is uncomfortable. Thus, a headphone EEG was considered in the design of the proposed system. The subjects felt more comfortable with the headphones than with the EEG cap. We present a novel CNN to classify MI. we propose a new feature structure. The signal was reshaped to a 3-dimension matrix, the time dimension was reshaped to represent the first and second dimension, and the frequency band was used as the third dimension. The proposed method has achieved good performance on the motor imagery, and significantly increase the average accuracy.
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the portable EEG acquisition system. Section 3 introduces the experimental methods and design. Signal processing and classification are discussed in Section 4. Section 5 describes the results of three experiments. Finally, Section 6 discusses and concludes the current work.
