The traditional theory holds that sulfur is a harmful element in steel, and its existence is liable to cause defects, which leads to the decline of mechanical, welding, corrosion and other properties of steel. Recent studies have gained a new understanding of the role of sulfur in steel, sulfur can improve the cutting performance of steel, and sulfur can be combined with other elements to form sulfide, which can improves the tribological properties of steel [1]. However, although high sulfur steel has been widely used in bearing and bearing bush parts, the existence of sulfide in high sulfur steel and the evolution of sulfide during heat treatment are not clear, and the accuracy of sulfide morphology and size distribution cannot be satisfied by conventional statistical methods [2], [3]. With the application of computer image recognition technology in metallurgy and other traditional fields, taking the identification and quantitative analysis of metal structure as an example, computer image processing technology can quantitatively or semi-quantitatively calibrate the precipitated phase and dislocation in metallographic structure, scanning electron microscope microstructure and transmission electron microscope microstructure. It provides a new technical approach for microstructure identification [4], [5]. Computer-based image processing technology has great advantages over traditional manual evaluation. For example, computer image recognition technology not only makes the image analysis process simpler and quicker, avoids subjective errors caused by manual evaluation, makes the analysis results more objective and accurate, it also expanded the testing items of metallographic examination and promoted the improvement of detection level [6], [7]. In this paper, the statistical analysis of sulfides in high-sulfur steel before and after heat treatment is carried out with the help of professional image software Image Pro Plus, which is helpful for the further analysis and study of microstructure in high-sulfur steel, and for the study of the relationship between microstructure and material properties, so as to achieve the required properties more accurately by controlling the process, it has high theoretical and practical value in the whole metallurgical industry, and can be extended application to non-ferrous metals and alloys.
