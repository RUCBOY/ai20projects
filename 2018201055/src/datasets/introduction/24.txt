Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most pervasive disorders affecting approximately 5% of children and 2–4% of adults [[1], [2], [3]]. ADHD can negatively impact academic performance and social functions of the patient because it makes it difficult for them to focus their attention and control their behavior [4,5]. Right now, the clinical diagnosis of ADHD is challenging and usually with high misdiagnose rate [6]. That is why developing, and automatic diagnosing method with high accuracy is crucial. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) classifies three types of ADHD based on the main symptoms: I) predominantly inattentive presentation, II) predominantly hyperactive-impulsive presentation, and III) Combined presentation [7]. Although many studies, like [[8], [9], [10]], carefully investigated these symptoms, few of them [11,12] tried to discriminated features of different subtypes using neuroimaging methods.
There are different clinical procedures to address patients suffering from different sub-types of ADHD. Compared to two class classification, three class diagnosis is more complex, and therefore, more prone to diagnosis error, and consequently, incorrect diagnosis of ADHD sub-types can significantly decrease the effectiveness of the treatment process. Hence, having a high accuracy diagnosis system can meaningfully improve the treatment process. Social and academic difficulties are well-known clinical symptoms for both ADHD-C and ADHD-I types. However, these symptoms manifest variably in each of the sub-types. For instance, comorbid external features (like conduct disorders and oppositional defiant), response inhibition, and impairment in social functioning are more associated with ADHD-C. On the other hand, ADHD-I is more associated with internalizing comorbid disorders (like depression, self-esteem difficulties, and anxiety), shyness and passive social behavior [10,13]. Additionally, in spite of the long-lasting nature of inattentive symptoms, impulsivity and hyperactivity will no longer be valid clinical symptoms for diagnosis in late adolescent and adult ADHD [14]. Therefore, ADHD-C seems to be more diagnostically unstable during development compared with ADHD-I which suggests that different brain areas are affected in ADHD-I and ADHD-C. Consequently, clinical diagnosis of sub-types of ADHD remains a challenge [10].
Started from 80 years ago [15], electroencephalograph (EEG) has been one of the most wildly used neuroimaging techniques due to its accessibility and low cost [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. Multiple signal processing methods were used to discriminate electrophysiological alterations in children with ADHD, including but not limited to power analysis [17,23,24], complexity analysis [[25], [26], [27]], and synchronization [25,28]. Using these handcrafted feature engineering, many machine learning algorithms like logistic regression [29,30], linear discriminant analysis [31], and support vector machines (SVM) [[32], [33], [34]] were developed as a complementary tool for ADHD diagnosis.
Yet convolutional neural networks (CNN) have an advantage in comparison to the models mentioned above, which is their ability to learn features automatically using a large dataset [[35], [36], [37]]. CNN had enormous success in fields like computer vision and natural language processing thanks to the vast annotated datasets [[38], [39], [40]]. Over the years, multiple architectures were introduced, such as AlexNet [41] and GoogLeNet [42], which some of them outperformed human-level accuracy. This astonishing performance leads to a rising expectation that CNNs should also be able to solve the ADHD diagnosis problem. In the study of Kuang et al. [43], ADHD and normal control groups were classified using a deep belief network. Resting-state fMRI data was used to classify different subtypes of ADHD from healthy subjects. The results were validated with an inter-subject cross-validation method with 72% accuracy. Zou et al. [44] presented a model that combined fMRI and sMRI data; they used a three-dimensional CNN to extract the local spatial patterns of sMRI data and another CNN to combine the information from sMRI feature extraction network and fMRI data. With inter-subject cross-validation method, the accuracy of classifying different subtypes of ADHD from healthy was reported 69%. In another study, Atif et al. [45] designed deep structure, consisting of three sub-networks, capable of classifying raw fMRI time-series data. With the same validation method, the accuracy of classifying ADHD from healthy was reported 68%.
In this study, the classification process was performed using a resting-state EEG signal, i.e., the brain activities recorded while no sensory stimulation or task performance is present. One should always consider that interpretation of task-related fluctuation of brain functions is somewhat tricky, without having sufficient knowledge of individual functional differences among patients who have ADHD during rest state. Furthermore, in task-related studies, merely the activates occurring at a certain time window are investigated, and all other brain activities, most of the time, are ignored and treated as background noise [[46], [47], [48]]. Additionally, it should be considered that the brain is a system with intrinsic activities; this means that the brain’s intrinsic activity is usually altered, and not caused by the external stimuli [[48], [49], [50]]. As an example, Gruber et al. [51] showed that visual stimuli could be predated by pre-stimulus EEG activities; further, Mazaheri et al. [52] argued that pre-stimulus EEG activities could predict motor responses.
Our study uses machine-learning algorithms to provide a differential diagnosis of the different subtypes of ADHD. Currently, the diagnostic process of psychiatric diseases fully depends on experienced psychiatrists, which is not always without mistakes. Therefore, there is a great tendency to automate the diagnostic process using machine-learning algorithms. Deep Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) both offer high performance and show meaningful differences between individuals suffering from ADHD in terms of spatial-frequency abnormalities.
In many previous studies [[53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58]], the architecture design of CNNs for EEG classification is inspired by classical EEG feature extraction and classification methods. As can be seen in Fig. 1, the typical EEG feature extraction and decoding pipeline consist of a band-pass filtering, spatial filtering, and a classifier. The band-pass block filters the input signal into a series of predetermined bands. In the spatial filter method, like a common spatial filter (CSP), finds the optimum combination of channels. The variance of the signal is calculated, and finally, these values are used as features for classification.Download : Download high-res image (226KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

One hopes that these observed individual abnormalities could improve targeted treatment of children afflicted with ADHD and, in general, improve our knowledge about the nature of the disease itself. We organized this paper in the following manner: Section 2 explains the collection and preprocessing of the EEG data and described the proposed method in detail. Sections 3, 4 and 5 will contain results, discussion, and conclusion, respectively.
