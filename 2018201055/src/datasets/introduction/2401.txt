Generally, breast cancer is spread due to DNA damage or hereditary changes that threatened the women health [1], [2]. The important factors that control the appearing breast cancer are gender, age, and genetic factor. Mammography is imaging instrument of the breast to distinguish between benign and malignant.
Breast cancer has several special diseases like micro-calcifications (MCCs), which are very small bits of calcium, appearing on a mammogram as small bright spots and masses. MCCs are tiny sizes from 0.33 to 0.7 mm and are shinier than neighboring tissues. Therefore, MCCs are hard to discover by the radiologist in examination programs because they show with low contrast due to their little shape [3]. The radiologist decided the cancer presence or not according to the shape of MCCs. However, there are 30–50% errors in breast cancer diagnostics early because of the existence of MCCs clusters.
Early detection and recognition of breast cancer played a significant function in cancer handling to reduce the death-rate [4]. An interesting solution to getting more information from the breast, and helping the physicians to raise their detection accuracy is using CAD [5]. CAD algorithms have been used for image analysis to form the feature extraction in order to achieve the correct decisions [6]. The computer outcome is more accurate than radiologist’s diagnosis because of differences in diagnosis can be large [7]. Several methods in mammography have been used to promote radiologists diagnostic and detection performance by indicating suspicious areas. Stefanoyiannis et al. [8] suggested a model for mammographic image techniques. This technique involved equalization of images density by improving the contrast at the breast periphery.
Byng et al. [9] presented image enhancement by using filtering technique to clarify the breast images. Pohlman et al. [10] prospered a high level of detection sensitivity for breast images by an adaptive region growing technique. Petrick et al. [11] suggested two stages of image enhancement by Difference-of-Gaussian (DoG) edge detector for the masses discovery. Kegelmeyer et al. [12] improved a technique for speculated masses detection of 5 features sets for each pixel by local edge orientation histogram (LEOH) and the output of four spatial filters which are a subset of k. Laws texture features [13].
The objective of this paper is to build a CAD system that recognizes and describes techniques of MCCs detection. The proposed methodology is based on several steps; a CAD system started through preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, and finally classification.
