Evidence of falling semen quality has been reported in many studies (Carlsen et al., 1992; Levine et al., 2017; Swan et al., 2000), which becomes a serious public health concern. Many animal and human studies suggest that exposure to metals/metalloids (hereafter, simply referred to as “metals”), may partly contribute to this decline. Metals are distributed broadly in the environment because of original existence in nature and emissions from human activities. Humans can be exposed to metals either voluntarily through supplementation, or involuntarily through intake of contaminated environmental media (e.g., food, water). Aluminum (Al), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), thallium (Tl), lead (Pb) and uranium (U) are nonessential xenobiotics. Human and animal evidence suggests that these metals may adversely affect male reproductive health at relatively low levels (Kasperczyk et al., 2008; Li et al., 2016; Marzec-Wroblewska et al., 2012; Souidi et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2016d, 2017; Wu et al., 2012). Other metals, such as chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se) and molybdenum (Mo), are essential for certain physiological functions (Kasperczyk et al., 2016a; Skandhan et al., 2012; Tajaddini et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2015). However, excessive exposure may also impair male reproductive health (Jeng et al., 2015; Kasperczyk et al., 2016b; Li et al., 2012a; Marzec-Wroblewska et al., 2012; McGough and Jardine, 2017; Wang et al., 2016a, 2016b).
Computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) parameters, including straight-line velocity (VSL), curvilinear velocity (VCL), average path velocity (VAP), linearity (LIN), straightness (STR) and amplitude head displacement (ALH), are best used for kinematic analysis of spermatozoa, which provide additional insights into sperm motion characteristics (Alipour et al., 2017; Goodson et al., 2017). Both in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that CASA motion characteristics of progressively motile spermatozoa are closely related to fertilization rates and time to conception (Barratt et al., 1993; Donnelly et al., 1998; Garrett et al., 2003; Irvine et al., 1994; Krause, 1995; Larsen et al., 2000; Liu et al., 1991; Shibahara et al., 2004). Several researchers explored the effects of exposure to certain chemicals (e.g., epichlorohydrin and alpha-chlorohydrin) on CASA motion parameters in animal models and revealed that the CASA characteristics were more sensitive markers of reproductive toxicity than conventional sperm quality parameters (Perreault and Cancel, 2001; Slott et al., 1995, 1997). However, no human studies to date have evaluated the associations between metal exposure and CASA motion parameters.
Concentrations of metals in urine are frequently used as exposure biomarkers in population studies. However, our variability analysis revealed that urinary metal concentrations varied greatly over a 3-month period and that single measurement could result in a moderate degree of exposure misclassification; collection of repeated samples from each subject improved the classification (Wang et al., 2016c). Besides, metals in seminal plasma are suspected as more direct makers for the exposure status of male reproductive system than that in urine, and seminal plasma Al, As, Mn, Co, Ni, Se, Cu, Zn, Mo, Cd, Sn and Pb have been tested for their exposure effects on male reproductive disorders in previous studies (Guzikowski et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2012; Zafar et al., 2015). Therefore, in this study we simultaneously determined concentrations of 18 metals both in seminal plasma and repeated urine samples among 746 Chinese adult men with aims to: a) explore the associations of urinary and seminal plasma metals with CASA motion parameters; and b) assess the degree of correspondence between these two sample types.
