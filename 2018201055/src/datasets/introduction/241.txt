Centralities are used to identity essential nodes in complex networks and have many practical applications. For example, they can be applied to identify the influential people [1], the likelihood of a suspect [2], the key genetic and protein targets [3], and the most key road in transport congestion [4]. Furthermore, centrality measures are very useful for understanding the behavior of systems [5], [6]. Recently, various centrality measures(e.g., degree centrality [7], betweenness centrality [8], [9], HITS centrality [10], PageRank centrality [11] and closeness [12] centrality, etc.) have been established for ranking the nodes in complex networks. HITS centrality is among the most attracting centrality measures. This centrality is based on the Perron eigenvector of the adjacency matrix of a directed network.
In the real world, researchers have found that most complex systems are not simply represented by single-layer, multilayer, or temporal networks. However, they are instead represented by multilayer temporal networks. In other words, some complex engineered systems have a multilayer structure [13], [14] and edges in each layer appear and disappear over time [15], [16]. For example, the citation network proposed in [17] is a simple multilayer temporal network. An edge Eiαtjβτ in this network represents that an article written by author j in journal β in year τ is cited by an article written by author i in journal α in year t. Thus, multilayer temporal networks can better capture the topological structure of some complex systems.
Many centrality measures, including degree, betweenness, closeness, HITS, PageRank, and eigenvector centralities, have been generalized from mono-layer networks to multilayer networks [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. On the other hand, various centrality measures of single-layer networks have also been extended to rank the nodes in temporal networks, such as communicability centrality [23], [24], [26], [27], [28], betweenness [25], and eigenvector-based centralities [29], [30], [31]. The simplest method to extend the centralities mentioned above to multilayer temporal networks is to aggregate the multilayer temporal networks into multilayer or temporal networks. Then, applying the existing centralities of multilayer or temporal networks for identifying the essential nodes in complex networks with multilayer and temporal features. However, this strategy ignores the temporal or multilayer features of networks, and this may lead to the wrong identification of the important nodes.
As far as we know, there exist only two articles related to the centrality of multilayer temporal networks that have been published [32], [17]. Wang et al. [32] proposed a fifth-order tensor to represent multilayer temporal networks. Based on the proposed fifth-order tensor, the authors generalized the classical PageRank and eigenvector centralities for identifying the key nodes in multilayer temporal networks. Their ranking methods only obtain the centrality values of nodes, without considering the importance of layers and time stamps. Similar to [32], Arrigo et al. [17] introduced a fifth-order tensor to represent multilayer temporal networks and extended the HITS centrality for multilayer temporal networks, named Multi-dimensional HITS centrality(MD-HITS). MD-HITS can obtain five centrality vectors: two for the nodes, two for the layers, and one for time stamps. However, the centrality measures proposed in [17], [32] only consider the relationships of inter-layer in the same time window and ignore the interactions of the inter-layer between different time stamps.
In our recent paper [31], based on nodes similarity, we proposed a new eigenvector centrality for multilayer and temporal networks. For multilayer networks, we assume that there exist interactions between different layers. For temporal networks, we consider that the interactions between different time stamps do not only exist on the neighbor timestamps but also exist on the other time stamps. Furthermore, the interactions between different time stamps should follow the time order. Based on these considerations, in this paper, we propose a sixth-order tensor to represent multilayer temporal networks, which synthetically considers the multilayer and temporal features.
To correctly measure the interactions of the inter-layer, we use the inter-layer similarity to measure the strength of the interactions between different layers, and we also define a novel inter-layer similarity index. We firstly compute the PageRank centrality vector of each layer in multilayer temporal networks, and then define the similarity between any two layers by computing the distance of PageRank centrality vectors.
By using the constructed sixth-order tensor, we extend the classical HITS for multilayer temporal networks, referred to as the MT-HITS centrality. The proposed centrality obtains the hub and authority centrality vectors of nodes, layers, and time stamps, respectively, which can be defined via mutually-reinforcing recursive relationships. These recursive relationships can be formalized by constructing a set of tensor equations. Afterward, we obtain the hub and authority values of nodes, layers, and time stamps by developing an iterative algorithm to solve the established tensor equations. Under some reasonable conditions, the existence and uniqueness of the proposed centrality can be guaranteed by existing results. Finally, we provide the convergence and convergence rate of the iterative algorithm.
Experimentally, we test the proposed centrality on three networks, including synthetic and real-world multilayer temporal networks. The numerical experiments show that the ranking results of nodes provided by our method are quite different from the results of some existing centralities. Besides, the empirical findings indicate that the proposed centrality has higher discrimination than the other centralities. We also apply our proposed ranking method for the temporal link prediction problem. The numerical results show that our method outperforms some existing algorithms.
