Materials doped with lanthanide (Ln) ions are well known and widely explored due to having several optical applications. CaYAl3O7 (CYAM) is one such system where interesting luminescent properties when doped with Ln, were observed. Experimental work has suggested several possible uses, including sensing structural damage, solid-state light sources for white LEDs and temperature sensors [[1], [2], [3]]. These potential applications are linked to the type of Ln-doping as well as the way that the Ln3+ ion interacts with the surrounding neighbourhood and that is a direct effect of the first neighbour distances and the Ln3+ site symmetry. Furthermore, the relative position of the rare-earth 5 d orbitals with respect to the conduction band of the material can also influence the luminescence properties [4]. This happens because when the excited-state 5 d orbitals are located close enough to the conduction band of the host crystal structure that the photoionization or charge transfer can occur [4]. Recently, an alternative approach using DFT band gap predictions and Debye temperature has been published [4].
CYAM is a member of the melilite family with a tetragonal crystalline structure, belonging to the space group P421m [5]. The crystal structure is formed of a sheet-like arrangement with five membered rings in (AlO4)−5 tetrahedra perpendicular to the c-axis. The Ca2+ and Y3+ ions are distributed randomly in the same six coordinated sites with Cs symmetry between the layers. This shared site has been suggested as the most probable substitutional site for Ln3+ and other cation dopants by experimental work [6], but it is not possible to determine experimentally which ion is substituted owing to intrinsic disorder of the Ca/Y shared site. This characteristic of the CYAM structure is one of the challenges for defect modelling calculations [7].
This problem was treated previously using computer modelling based on interatomic potential using a strategy, away from the traditional mean field approach. This strategy was based on building up supercells with Ca/Y ions randomly distributed, keeping the composition ratio of 1:1 and using the quality of the simulated XRD pattern as compared to the standard pattern deposited in the crystallographic database as a criterion for choosing the best supercell size and the Ca/Y distribution [7]. Results for intrinsic defect calculations predicted successfully an oxygen Frenkel defect as the most probable form of disorder [7], in line with experimental work reported in literature [8]. The present paper applies such a strategy to simulate the doping process of CYAM by Ln ions. The calculations enabled predictions of the sites occupied by dopant ions and possible forms of charge compensation defects, when required. Results can be used to explain features found in the luminescence properties of this materials observed by experimental works.
