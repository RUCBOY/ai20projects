In brain computer interface (BCI) research, electroencephalography (EEG) is the most commonly used non-invasive brain measurement modality for its easy practicality and high temporal resolution [[1], [2], [3]], which can provide a millisecond level insight into the local field potentials induced by synchronous neuron activities [4,5]. However, due to the volume conduction [6,7], EEG signals are unavoidably contaminated by philosophy and non-philosophy artifacts, such as electromyography (EMG), electrooculography (EOG), electrocardiography (ECG) and line noise, etc.
Common spatial patterns (CSP) and independent component analysis (ICA) are two widely used and efficient spatial filtering algorithms for feature extraction in BCI design. Comparisons of two methods have been done in some literatures for motor execution and motor imagery classification [[8], [9], [10], [11]], but different conclusions were reached. Ou Bai et al. evaluated a total of 90 combinations of spatial filtering algorithms, temporal filtering algorithms and pattern classification algorithms in a study of 12 naive participants in order to effectively assess the performance of different algorithm combinations to classify the self-paced key stroke movements with either hand. The experiment results showed that the ICA algorithm provided higher performance than CSP algorithm. Based on a dataset of 9 healthy participants performing the imagination of the left hand and right hand movement, the ICA spatial filters derived from motor imagery or resting states were investigated and compared with the CSP algorithm (Wang et al., 2012). The classification accuracies of ICA designed on the two states were comparable. Meanwhile, the ICA and CSP had the close classification performance. In Naeem et al. (2006) and Brunner et al. (2007), different ICA algorithms (Infomax, FastICA and SOBI) and CSP algorithm were respectively applied to the same datasets of four classes motor imageries (left hand, right hand, foot or tongue) for 8 subjects, whereas different conclusions were drawn. Naeem et al. proved that CSP was the best algorithm followed by Infomax, FastICA and finally SOBI, while Infomax yielded the highest accuracies in Brunner et al. (2007). The different results were due to different feature extraction and selection methods. Therefore, parameter selection was one of the key factors of spatial filtering algorithms in BCI application.
In reported studies, the CSP algorithm was more popular in motor imagery BCI (MIBCI) for its good classification performances and simplicity in practice [11,12]. However, the CSP was also known to be sensitive to noise and prone to overfitting [13,14]. Meanwhile, as a supervised algorithm, a large number of labeled training data were required to calibrate CSP-BCI system. Although some extensions of CSP algorithm have been proposed to overcome these difficulties [[15], [16], [17], [18]], owing to the non-stationary of EEG, these problems remain to be tackled.
ICA algorithm aims to separate a set of spatially fixed and maximally temporal independent components (ICs) from multi-channel raw signals [19]. Makeig et al. first applied ICA to EEG data [20] and now ICA has been successfully applied in many EEG research fields. On one hand, ICA was served as a denoising technology for removing artifacts and enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [[21], [22], [23], [24]]. On the other hand, ICA was widely applied for extracting task-related ICs [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]], such as in MIBCI system, motor-related ICs (MRICs) originating from the primary motor cortex during limb motor imageries were often extracted for feature calculation [11,[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]]. However, few literatures intensively studied the major factors affecting the performance of ICA algorithm and how to improve it. Meanwhile, in both conditions, permutation indeterminacy of ICs is an inevitable difficulty in extracting the independent sources of interest.
Our previous works [30,31] aimed to construct a simple MIBCI system based on ICA algorithm. The spatial patterns of ICs were successfully applied in identifying MRICs, which validated the spatial stability of de-mixing independent sources. Nevertheless, the “ground truth” sources of EEG data were not yet available, so the numbers and locations of scalp electrodes were usually determined on our previous experiences and many times of trying. It is the fact that different numbers of electrodes were applied in BCI researches, varying from the minimal set of 3 channels to 119 channels [9,25,27,28,[33], [34], [35], [36], [37]] and even more. Although multi-channel EEG can obtain more cortex signals, it is not practical in BCI implementation for costing too much preparing time. Moreover, independent sources are estimated by the linear mixing of all channel EEG signals in the decomposition process of ICA, so more channels of EEG signals will increase the probabilities of bringing in various artifacts. On the contrary, too few channels also cannot provide enough information for extracting various artifacts-related sources. Therefore, the residual noises will be still mixed in the extracted task-related sources.
The problem of channel selection has been investigated in several literatures. In [38], channel selection strategy of recursive feature elimination (RFE) was proposed for eliminating the irrelevant features in support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Under the premise of unknowing explicit prior knowledge of the neural tasks, the numbers of channels can be reduced without a decrease of accuracy. However, the classification performance of this specific-classifier-based method relies on the parameter adjustment and the quality of training samples. The CSP algorithm is a commonly used spatial filtering method for discriminating two-class EEG signals in BCI implementation. In [39,40], the channels were directly ranked by the contribution scores of each channel in constructing a projection matrix of CSP algorithm. Based on different optimization objective function, the optimal channels were proved to achieve better performance in [41,42]. In general, although above mentioned methods can significantly reduce channel numbers and simultaneously ensured no loss of classification accuracy, or even higher accuracies can be obtained, the numbers of selected channels are still more than our expected values. Rejer et al [33] demonstrated the practicability of using only three electrodes located on motor cortex {C3, Cz, C4} in ICA-based MIBCI for classifying left hand and right hand motor imageries, but few papers investigated the channel selection algorithm for multi-class MIBCI system [43].
In this study, we investigated ICA-based channel selection method for multi-class MI classification. Considering the real application of BCI, two main goals of this study were: Firstly, to design a fully automatic method for selecting optimal channels from multi-channel MI-EEG signals, which can obtain high classification accuracy with the minimal electrode subset. Secondly, to investigate the consistence of optimal channels in different sessions for each long-term BCI user. Although the distribution and amount of real neural sources were unknown, the positions of motor related neural sources were steadily positioned on motor cortex. Considering the diversity of the brain’s structure of different subjects and the displacement of electrodes during the different calibrating date, the three motor-related electrodes were respectively selected from the nine channels {FC3, C3, CP3}, {FCz, Cz, CPz} and {FC4, C4, CP4} rather than the specific three electrodes {C3, Cz, C4} located on primary motor cortex. We called them “main electrodes”, since it plays a key role in influencing ICA-based MI-BCI performance. The remaining “subordinate electrodes” were searched one by one from the left electrodes on the principle of achieving higher classification accuracies until the accuracies climbed up to the maximum. Meanwhile, in order to address the non-stationarity problem of EEG data across different subjects as well as different sessions within same individual subject, the single_trial_based_self_testing (STST) method was proposed, which transfer the optimal channel subsets of one subject or session to another, rather than the spatial filters. Furthermore, another advantage of the STST method is that it can greatly reduce the impact of the low-quality EEG data in ICA designing [30].
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the detailed experimental paradigm and electrode distributions during calibrating three-class MI-EEG data. The simplified Infomax was presented and compared with the standard Infomax algorithm in EEGLAB [44]. After ICA calculation, a method for identifying three MRICs was proposed for features calculation and classification. Meanwhile, the channel selection algorithm based on STST data selection method was explained. Section III exemplifies the results of the proposed method in three-class MI-EEG datasets. Section IV discussed the possible problems during implementing the BCI system. And finally, the paper was concluded in Section V.
