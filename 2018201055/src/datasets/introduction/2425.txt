More than 70 years have passed since the publication of a seminal article “A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity” [10]. They tried to understand how the brain, using the interactions of the interconnected networks of neurons, could produce very complex patterns. According to their approach, the brain consists of Boolean units that act based on the threshold function. Boolean units incorporate basic logic gates (e.g., AND, OR, NOT,…) to form the cores of today's computers. The development of the introduced simple framework of Boolean units was presented by von Neumann's novel paper, which introduced more flexible computational elements [35]. These concepts, together with Shannon's seminal work [43] in Boolean circuit optimization, form the infrastructure of today's computational framework. The development of artificial neural networks [13] and machine learning theories [18] are the debtor of the computational paradigm of McCulloch and Pitts. Actually, the development of the next generation of neural networks called Perceptron (linear classifier prototype) [39], which was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, had been triggered by previous scientists' efforts. Today, the recursive and multi-layered structures of this network have been developed and have found numerous practical applications [27]. Fairly we can conclude that the concept of Boolean neurons adopted from the first and second generation of neural networks had a limited impact on neuroscience.
With the rapid advancement of scientific reports in the field of neuroscience, the fundamental aspects of computational abilities of the nervous system remain unclear [37]. On the other hand, it is evident that the implementations of complex brain functions consist of the interconnected structure of the basic neural element called neurons, the functionalities of which have enhanced when operating as an ensemble [1]. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are known as the third generation of neural network models. SNNs have increased the level of realism in a neural simulation, which incorporate the concept of time into the operating model of the neuron [12].
So far, two different aspects of the logical gates with spiking quiddity have been studied: the logic gate in the form of spiking neural P systems [44], [14], [19], [25], [20], [28], [50] and experimental observations [15], [48].
The reason for the formation of spiking neural networks was to bring artificial neural network calculations closer to the computational approach of the nervous system [2]. The spiking neural P system (SN P system) can be classified as a static spiking neural network (SSNN) that considers firing rate and refractory time in neural activation compared to the second-generation neural networks [21]. In fact, the SN P system introduces a behavioral protocol of firing activity of neurons [21]. Pioneering works of designing the neural-like logic gates proposed computational structures based on SN P systems with a simple behavioral protocol instead of real dynamical neurons [20], [28], [50]. Dynamic spiking neural networks (DSNN) are the context that connects the nature of spiking networks to the biological aspect of the nervous system [22]. In DSNN, neurons and synapses are described by dynamic equations, which are defined in the computational neuroscience based on the ionic basis of electrical activity in the nervous system [17]. The distinction of this article with the previous works on the SN P system [44], [14], [19], [25], [20], [28], [50], [7], [16] is that we used DSNN to propose spiking gates based on the dynamic quiddity of the nervous system. Therefore, the computational model of the pyramidal neuron (PY), interneuron (IN), excitatory and inhibitory synapses AMPA and GABA, which are the basic elements of the hippocampus [30], was considered as the basis of the design of spiking frequency gates. The proposed approach compared to the logic gates using SN P systems has a more realistic approach of the brain dynamic. Therefore, it can be more compatible with information coding of the nervous system.
On the other hand, some experimental studies reinforce the view that nervous system consists of dynamic logic gates based on time-dependent logic modes [15], [48]. Through the experimental paradigm, researchers [15], [48] proved that a significant difference exists between the functional structure of brain logical operation and computer logic. It has been observed that unlike logic gates embedded on chips with a rigid truth-table, the function of the brain's gates is related to the frequency of their activity. Therefore, it was encouraged us to provide a new systematic approach and computational tools to develop traditional Boolean algebra in spiking networks. Inspired by these findings, we designed SFGs based on the dynamic model of neurons and synapses. We hope that machines consisting of SFGs might go beyond the computation paradigm of the universal Turing machine [29], [47].
What we are facing now is the computational and cognitive ability of the nervous system against artificial neural networks. Compared to computational machines, the nervous system has a lower computational speed, but at the same time, the ability of the nervous system in generalization, decision-making, and learning relative to today's machines is significantly higher. Unique abilities of the nervous system in cognitive processes have been created by powerful information coding [9]. Therefore, by designing spiking gates based on the dynamic elements of the nervous system, powerful coding such as Prolate spheroidal wave functions [33], temporal coding [40] and so on can be used to extract and transfer information in the spiking computing system. With this approach, it can be hoped that the current computing systems that transmit data based on the sequence of zero-and-one will be replaced with the spiking machines, based on the dynamic model of neurons and synapses adapted from the computational model of brain. The horizon that illustrates our main motivation is to propose a dynamic structure for computational machines based on SFGs.
The proposed layout leads to a new class of mathematical computation based on SFGs. After that, by combining a set of SFGs, we constructed important spiking circuits (full-adder, multiplexer, arithmetic-logic-unit) with neural spiking gates.
These results can be expanded to a pioneering method for designing logic circuits working in a neural-like manner. On the other hand, multi-valued logic simulates fuzzy logic that is valuable in reasoning which is not fixed and exact. Boolean logics as the crisp logics are true or false logic, while fuzzy logic consists of variables with truth-value in the ranges between 0 and 1 [11]. Regarding the considered frequency range for the operation of SFGs, we will be able to introduce spiking gates with fuzzy coding in future works.
In the next section, we explain the dynamic model of neuron and synapse. Section 3 illustrates the designing procedure of spiking frequency gates. Section 4 demonstrates spiking circuits based on SFGs and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.
