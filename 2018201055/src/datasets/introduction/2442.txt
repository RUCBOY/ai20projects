Subsequent axonal damage, demyelination and immune mediated inflammation can cause loss of motor and sensory function which could result in a chronic disease of the central nervous system known as multiple sclerosis (MS) [1].
Based on the estimation of WHO more than two million people endure this pain and MS is one of the generally known reasons of neurological disability in young adults. The range of 15/100/000 to 250/100/000 makes MS disease prevalent in numerous areas of the world. Most patients undergo recurrent episodes (relapses) of neurological impairment, but in 60 to 80 percent of patients the disease course happens to progress by time resulting in a cognitive deficit and cumulative motor disability [2]. Despite all the efforts made worldwide to identify its nature, no certain criterion for its diagnosis has ever been found. It is also believed that its neurobehavioral sequelae can include: cognitive dysfunction, fatigue, depression, motor and neuropsychiatric lesions [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. It is worth mentioning that cognitive problems and physical disabilities can occur independently of each other, which can make multiple sclerosis even more complex to recognize and identify [8]. It is also believed that impairments in patients mostly depend on the disruption of corticocortical connections caused by demyelination within the white matter [9], [10].
Cognitive dysfunction, as it is assumed by many, is one of the most prevalent problems associated with MS, whose type, severity and frequency have been variously reported in the existing literature [11]. It is believed that these physical and cognitive dysfunctions are caused by plaques in nervous system, which can generally influence the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord to a great extent [12]. A quick look at the literature indicates that some studies have already investigated MS patient's disability in working memory [13], object recognition [14], visual attention [15], [16], information speed processing, verbal fluency and executive functioning during the disease [7], [8], [17]. The results obtained from some studies demonstrate that the mean reaction time reflecting visual attention in visual search tasks for MS patients is significantly high compared with that of healthy subjects [18] and some doesn`t [19]. Some evidence also illustrates that MS patients unintentionally confuse attention and memory processes and can consequently interpret attention deficits as memory impairments [20].
Research findings on visual attention dysfunction in MS patient remain categorically unclear, and there is a string of mixed findings in this regard. While some researchers observed that MS patients had impaired attention [21], others reported no discrimination between MS patients and controls in visual attention tasks [22]. It is evident that these deficiencies could adversely affect MS patients; thus, an early diagnosis can improve the therapeutic strategies and help patients to a great extent.
In recent years, due to advancements in neuroimaging and electrophysiological techniques, researchers have been able to demonstrate the structural and functional changes in the brain during the brain disease [23], [24]. It is worth mentioning that an early diagnosis of asymptomatic brain diseases could tremendously lessen the adverse effect(s) of MS disease. It is also believed that Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems can help clinicians enhance the prediction accuracy, complement the neuropsychological assessments, and consequently confirm their diagnosis. CAD is also thought to have potential future applications in digital pathology through machine learning algorithms. The CAD system for EEG diagnosis can include: feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning algorithms methods. There are some studies, in this regard, which have used CAD systems to differentiate a brain abnormality state from the healthy one [25], [26], [27], [28].
The early diagnosis of brain disorders could be clinically effective in patients with MS disease and result in improved safety and more ready treatment procedures. Due to the fact that patients with these lesions are abundant in number and their early detection and diagnosis may necessitate a considerable amount of time and effort, attempts have been made to develop Computer Aided Diagnosis Systems to distinguish patients from healthy controls. It should be mentioned that previous studies suggested several characteristic features to extract abnormalities in MS patients during various brain states, task free or task related. Several other studies also utilized such methods as coherence, mutual information, and microstate analysis for the diagnosis of EEG signals [9], [26] .It should be noted that these studies strove to investigate the effect of lesions on brain signal and image, and did not make use of machine learning algorithms and CAD systems.
The diagnosis of MS disease is much more complex than those of other neurological diseases. Several automated or semi-automated methods have been recommended for the diagnosis of MS disease. For instance, Zijdenbos et al. [27] devised a CAD system to carry out the pipeline analysis of MS lesions in MRI data. R. Linder et el. [29] also relied on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood examination findings and used a CAD system to identify MS patients. In the same vein, Yamamoto et al. [30] utilized a CAD system to detect MS lesions relying on a level set method in brain MR images. Another recommendation was made by Alfano et al. [31] who suggested an automated method that took advantage of relaxometric and geometric features to facilitate the classification of MS lesions in MR images. Similarly, Leemput et al. [32] recommended an automated method through an intensity-based tissue classification and a stochastic model so as to diagnose MS lesions in MR images.
For many decades, EEG has been one of the most employed tests in adult and pediatric neurology, intensive care, and psychiatry. EEG signals comprise five frequency bands and the interaction between neural oscillations, which are called Cross Frequency Coupling (CFC). CFC has been identified as a physiologically relevant activity observed in various areas of the human brain and has intensively been mentioned in the literature in recent years. In order to extract the instantaneous frequency, phase and amplitude of EEG signal, six types of CFC have been defined. Among the six CFC types, Phase Amplitude Coupling (PAC), also called nested oscillations, has received more recognition. This coupling is normally observed in various brain regions and potentially involves memory and attention process, sensory integration [33], [34], and behavioral tasks [35]. It can also be modulated by pathology [36], [37]. It is estimated that the large-scale interactions between the cortical areas involve coupling between the phase and the amplitude of various brain rhythms, which are studied in the detection and the pathophysiology of such brain disorders as epileptic seizure [38], [39], [40], Parkinson's [37], [41], [42], and Alzheimer's disease [43]. It should, however, be noted that this coupling for MS disease has inadequately been investigated in the literature. In this study, we employed a CAD system and used PAC in a visual attention task for the diagnosis of MS disease, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been studied thus far. Hence, this study is a recent effort investigating the CAD of MS disease through EEG signals with its focus on the PAC features. The EEG signal acquisition, preprocessing, and the statistical methods used for feature extraction and feature selection are all expressed comprehensively in this paper. It should be noted that the proposed CAD system was validated by means of leave one out cross validation method study. Then, we used machine learning algorithms as we had intended to focus on early MS diagnosis.
