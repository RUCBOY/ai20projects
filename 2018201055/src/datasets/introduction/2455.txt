Typical control problems in chemical plants involve safety, reliability and product quality specifications during transient operations of the plants. Examples are safety specifications during start-up, shut-down, emergency shut-down, and changeover processes, or minimizing off-spec production during the transition of operating mode of a plant to be settled down to a new steady-state condition. Furthermore, the probability of abnormal situations and off-spec production considerably increases during the transition processes [1], [2], mostly due to the involvement of operators in the operation of the plant [3]. In addition to the mentioned qualitative specifications, usually there are also quantitative specifications that should be respected during the transition operations. These specifications may include transition time, production and operation costs, or any other cost or utility functions. While the design of transient operating procedures is critically important, it is still left to expert engineers and plant personnel [4]. Such control problems are addressed mostly as operating procedure synthesis problems. The synthesis of an operating procedure can be represented as a problem of finding a sequence of plant actions to change plants steady-state respecting some specifications.
Literature review on the investigated methods to solve the mentioned process control problems showed that the previously proposed methods can be categorized into state-based and trajectory-based manners [4]. In state-based approaches the feasibility of operations is investigated regarding only qualitative specifications. Therefore the operations can be provided as some preconditions to be respected by the plant's actuators. Some examples of using this approaches are [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. On the other hand, trajectory-based approaches incorporate also quantitative specifications and optimization of cost functions with respect to process dynamics. Galán and Barton [11] and Barton et al. [12] used mixed-integer dynamic optimization to obtain a time-optimal operation procedure for a safe changeover process with a non-convex state space. As they mentioned, the convergence to a global optimum was not guaranteed employing this method. Asprey et al. [13] proposed a two-layer optimization scheme to solve the same problem. The first layer optimized the overall operation time and the second layer solved a path-constrained optimization by defining a sum-of-squared-errors surface computed based on the difference between a pre-specified goal state vector and the system's state obtained by dynamic simulation. The latest work was modified by Suzuki and Batres [14] by incorporating a tabu-search algorithm as the optimization method. To deal with the non-convex state space in a similar safe changeover problem in Acrylic Acid synthesis process, Batres [4] employed a micro genetic algorithm. A fast seeding algorithm was used to estimate initial population so that the computational cost was reduced in comparison with traditional genetic algorithms. For the same case study, Shimizu [15] has applied the meta-heuristic differential evolution method to obtain a near optimal solution under safety constraints. More recent examples of trajectory-based approaches are [16], [17], [18], [19].
In this paper, the powerful framework of approximately bisimilar symbolic systems [20] is employed to solve a safe changeover control problem as a benchmark chemical process. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that a chemical process is modeled and controlled in this framework. A symbolic controller is a dynamic system including a symbolic model of the plant and can automatically take the process from an initial state to a specified target set. In contrast to the mentioned state- and trajectory-based methods, which can be classified as optimization-based approaches, the method based on symbolic models that we use in this paper, provides systematic tools for the design of embedded controllers, easily implementable in microprocessors, and guaranteed to satisfy the specifications in the respect of software and hardware constraints within a desired accuracy. The notion of approximate bisimulation allows one to replace differential equations of a control system by an approximately equivalent finite-state machine. Then, proper controllers can be designed by using efficient synthesis algorithms applied on the equivalent finite-state models. The contribution of this paper resides in showing how the control of a chemical process can be addressed by using techniques based on symbolic models.
Symbolic models have been proposed to solve control problems with complex specifications in the control systems and computer science communities recently. The basic idea in developing symbolic models is to approximate a control system, which is originally described in a continuous state space, by approximate discrete abstractions with finitely many states or symbols such that each state or symbol represents infinitely many states of the original system. Then the required controller can be computed on the basis of the symbolic model obtained. The construction of symbolic models starts with time discretization and state space quantization of the control system, which leads to a countable state space of symbols. Then, the obtained systems are connected to each other with some transition relations with respect to the dynamics of the control system. The result is a lower complexity model that can be used in controller design with respect to complex qualitative specifications. Such specifications can be described in the state space of symbolic models by dividing the states (symbols) and trajectories (transition relations) to good and bad states and trajectories. The bad states are those which do not satisfy qualitative specifications and the bad trajectories are those that need to be avoided since they lead the plant to bad states. Subsequently the quantitative specifications, specified by cost functions, can be implemented in the symbolic state space in an approximate manner [21]. Another advantage of using symbolic controllers is the fact that they are suited to describe software and hardware interfacing in practical applications, which are based on digital platforms.
There is a vast literature on symbolic models and symbolic controller design for different classes of control systems. Within the class of hybrid automata we recall timed automata [22], rectangular hybrid automata [23], and o-minimal hybrid systems [24], [25]. Early results for classes of control systems were based on dynamical consistency properties [26], natural invariants of the control system [27], l-complete approximations [28], and quantized inputs and states [29], [30]. Further works include results on controllable discrete-time linear systems [31], piecewise-affine and multi-affine systems [32], [33], [34], set-oriented discretization approach for discrete-time nonlinear optimal control problems [35], abstractions based on convexity of reachable sets [36], incrementally stable and incrementally forward complete nonlinear control systems with and without disturbances [37], [38], [39], [40], switched systems [41], time-delay systems [42], [43], networked control systems [44], nonlinear systems with quantized measurements of states [45] and outputs [46], and symbolic decentralized control with regular languages specifications [47], [48]. The interested reader is also referred to [49] and [20] for an overview on advances in this domain. The computation of symbolic models and symbolic controllers, based on the notion of approximate bisimulation, can be performed via software tools, as e.g. Pessoa, that is an open source MATLAB tool developed by Mazo et al. [50]; this tool has been employed frequently, e.g. by [20], [21], [38].
Symbolic controllers can be very useful in the automatic control of processes that cannot be controlled using conventional methods where controllers designed are based on path-optimization and trajectory tracking. Examples of such processes are safe changeover processes [4], optimal start-up problems [51], on-specification production problems [52], short-term scheduling problems [53], and problems in systems biology [54]. The advantages of the use of symbolic controllers in control of chemical processes with complex specifications, in comparison to the proposed methods in the literature, can be summarized as follows:
•In a symbolic space, a wide range of complex specifications, of interest in the control of chemical processes, can be properly handled. Addressing such specifications by means of conventional control design approaches is in general difficult. Furthermore, implementation of these kinds of specifications needs a certain level of insight and process knowledge that is not easy to capture.•Symbolic systems based on approximate bisimulation allow the synthesis of controllers, enforcing desired specification with any desired accuracy.•The synthesized symbolic controllers can be readily transformed into bug-free codes over any digital platform to be implemented on physical hardware.
