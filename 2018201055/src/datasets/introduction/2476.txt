Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) has constituted a dominant presence in online education, due to its great potential to articulate learning processes based on knowledge co-construction, and, consequently, it has become a research trend (Dillenbourg, 2003; Fischer, Rohde, & Wulf, 2007; Stahl, Koschmann, & Suthers, 2006). Collaborative learning promotes situations where built knowledge occurs sustained on small group exchanges, usually involving the aim to solve a problem or create a project, that is based on unstructured problems that involve an intense process of cooperation and negotiation to provide a solution, to create a product, or both (Johnson & Johnson, 2004; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1994). Extensive research has proven that well-structured collaboration, promoting learning through socio-cognitive processes of negotiation grounded on socio-emotional presence, improves learning and individual performance, as well as studentsâ€™ satisfaction (Johnson, Johnson, & Stanne, 2000; King, 2007; Kwon, Liu, & Johnson, 2014; Medina & Suthers, 2008; Oakley, Felder, Brent, & Elhajj, 2004).
The most focal research streams in collaborative learning refer to representation, discourse and pattern, covering methodology, interaction, and teaching assistance; factors influencing CSCL, focusing on critical thinking, argumentation, technological guidance, and theory-driven characteristics; and intervention and comparison, examining technological and contextual settings as well as scripting in collaboration processes (Tang, Tsai & Lin, 2014).
Beyond the relevance of each of these elements, in order to move forward to a deep understanding of the opportunities and challenges of collaborative learning, it would be necessary to build up a holistic vision that promotes the identification of interrelations between its key factors. Based on this perspective, and grounded on previous research on the field, this article establishes and assesses a model integrating some of the key constructs of CSCL and its influence on collaborative learning in virtual environments. Specifically, this model explores the relationships across teacher-student interaction, student interaction in work groups, intra-group emotional support, online collaborative tools, and collaborative learning.
