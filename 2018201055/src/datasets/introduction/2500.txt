Large-scale 3D printing technology has evolved into a trend in which natural materials can be employed, minimizing pollution issues and enhancing sustainability. 3D printing can be achieved with fast setting/hardening materials, guaranteeing high mechanical strength. The mechanical strength is influenced by the presence of cracks, propagation behavior and porosity [1], [2], [3]. Even conventional infrastructures such as long-span bridges, high-capacity dams, and high-rise skyscrapers are subject to danger resulting from crack generation and propagation. Cracks can range from minute internal microcracks to large-scale cracks. Depending on the width, length, and pattern, a collective pattern of microcracks can lead to macrocracks associated with catastrophic breakage in structural units [4], [5], [6]. To avoid such detrimental phenomena, problematic cracks should be detected prior to any secondary measures or ultimate development/improvement in materials and processing.
Many crack-detection techniques have been reported, e.g., surface replication, fiber Bragg grating sensors, stress corrosion tests, in situ charged-coupled device (CCD) monitoring, impedance-based cracking characterization, PZT-based acoustic emission measurements, and luminescent QD-based infiltration techniques [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. These probing techniques possess inherent deficiencies, such as the inability to independently detect the presence of cracks or to provide a quantitative description of prevalent crack contents in crack networks. In particular, crack propagation is difficult to predict in terms of upcoming time frames. The origins and classifications of cracks are diverse, ranging in size from internal microcracks to large (macroscale) cracks. Macroscale cracks can be formed either through the collective motion of a multitude of microcracks or through external factors such as inappropriate construction on-site practices, errors in structural design and detailing, and excessive interactions in hostile environments [6], [14], [16], [17], [18]. Crack complexity is directly associated with the feasibility of robotic 3D printing construction.
Deep learning has advanced due to synergistic integration of big data, algorithm enhancement, and ultra-fast parallel computing environments, producing substantial academic and industrial interest [19]. The complementary approaches of neural networks and deep learning have expanded in applications such as speech recognition, natural language processing, information retrieval, object recognition in image modes, and event detection in videos [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Deep learning can be applied to two primary tasks, i.e., classification and regression. This development has led to diverse approaches, ranging from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [25] to region-proposal neural networks such as Yolo, and R-CNNs [26], [27], [28].
Rapidly increasing computing power and innovative computational methodologies have been driving computational materials science into a new realm of materials design and materials property performance prediction, which are based on machine learning and high throughput computations [29], [30], [31], [32], [33] Furthermore, machine learning can be combined with a large shared database, leading to unprecedented novel materials discovery and property performance prediction in a synergistic manner [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. Lithium-ion batteries and glass systems were chosen as exemplary works for the applicability of machine learning [30], [31]. In particular, extensive reviews on machine learning in materials design and discovery were provided for general readers with the aim of applying the machine learning methodologies to challenging materials science and engineering [32], [33].
Network science has been extensively employed as an effective approach in describing and understanding complex networks which incorporate social networks, information/communication networks, epidemiology, biology, and economic networks [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Nodes (or equivalently vertices) and edges (or equivalently links or relationships between nodes) are regarded as the basic constituents of network science. Based on their associated network parameters, the type and features of the network system under interest can be extracted quantitatively in addition to the well-recognized visualizations, allowing for the prevention and measures with the aim to controlling the overall network system. Furthermore, there has been little literature which analyzes the crack-issue in terms of the quantitative network parameters.
Crack detection and classification represent a primary issue in deep learning applications for SHM in concrete-based buildings and bridges. Recently, AI, or more specifically, deep learning algorithms, has been applied to crack-based issues [41], [42], [43]. Unlike previous approaches, the current work combines the time-dependent evolution of cracks formed in loess-based materials, which represent a model system allowing artificial crack generation within a short time frame. To extract further structural information, network science was applied to the crack networks, which are interpreted in terms of nodes and links (or relationships). The most distinct innovative aspects of this work include a simplified approach for automatically detecting nodes and edges without any human bias, followed by a quantitative description of the cracks, which was previously considered qualitative.
Visual crack inspection is time-consuming and can be subjective depending on the inspector’s experience and skill. In the case of tiny and noisy cracks, cracks can be misclassified, i.e., ‘no crack’ misclassified as ’crack’ (false positive), and ‘crack’ misclassified as ‘no crack’ (false negative). Deep learning can be effectively exploited in a fast, reliable and objective manner with high precision, guaranteeing a high level of safety and quality control in structural parts and infrastructures. Previously, deep learning has been adapted for diverse concrete, pavement, and metallic nuclear component cracks using supervised learning [41], [42], [43].
The quantified parameters extracted from crack-based network science functions as ground truth information, which is indispensable for evaluation of deep learning-driven outcomes. Furthermore, the future direction of machine learning in crack-based networks is proposed with the aim of automatically providing the proposed parameters without any human involvement. The idealized integration of network science with deep learning can offer a comprehensive understanding of the complex crack networks taking place in diverse materials processing stages. The extracted microstructural parameters, i.e., degree-driven statistics on individual and network levels, can be exploited towards defect-free optimization mediated through systematic understanding and sophisticated control of network features, leading to significant industrial impacts. Furthermore, the network science-based interpretation of microstructure can be employed as an ultimate target of deep learning related to crack-based networks.
A loess/water mixture was chosen as a model system in order to simplify the generation and propagation of cracks in natural materials, where loess-based materials are employed as the core constituents. The current work focuses on the synergistic integration of deep learning and network science, with the aim of providing a novel quantitative characterization approach based on crack parameters associated with the potential application of large-scale 3D printing of natural materials. First, deep learning is used in detecting crack-based networks in terms of nodes and edges; then, the detected and observed cracks are subject to parameter quantification with the aim of achieving novel insight into crack-based networks.
