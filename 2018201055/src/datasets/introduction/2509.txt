The unprecedented proliferation of miniaturized Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smartphones, washing machines, and medical implants, has empowered people to share information with one another [1], [2]. These devices can communicate with one another directly or via Application Programming Interface (API) over the Internet, and they can be controlled by “learned” devices with high computing capabilities, such as cloud servers, that augment smartness to low-computing devices [3], [4], [5]. The smartness and communication capabilities of IoT devices offer many beneficial applications to common people, companies, industry, and governments. IoT application is also extended in the areas of transportation, healthcare, and smart cities [6]. In addition, the market trend of IoT is increasing, as indicated by CISCO’s estimation of IoT revenue, which will be around $14.4 trillion between 2013 and 2022.1  However, emerging IoT technologies face various security attacks and threats [7]. Notable threats include virus attacks, mass surveillance, and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, and disruption of IoT networks [8], [9], [10]. To investigate these attacks, well-trained teams must conduct a digital investigation, known as IoT forensics, on the crime scene [11], [12], [13]. An illustration of security concerns in IoT-based smart environments is provided in Fig. 1. The sources of evidence in IoT forensics include home appliances, cars, medical implants, sensor nodes, and tag readers, among others. In traditional forensics, the sources of evidence can be computers, mobile phones, servers, or gateways [14]. Regarding types of evidence data, IoT data can be available in any vendor-specific format, unlike in traditional forensics wherein data is mostly available in an electronic document or standard file formats [14].Download : Download high-res image (584KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

IoT forensics investigation involves many challenges due to the nonsuitability of currently available digital forensics tools and standard forensics methodologies in the IoT environment [15], [16], [17], [18]. IoT devices also generate a huge amount of diverse data that puzzle investigators when deciding the relevant source of evidence and identifying the exact amount of data to be used for further investigation [19].
Several surveys [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27] were conducted previously on the usage of digital forensics in multiple domains, i.e., cloud computing, edge computing, mobile cloud computing, software-defined networks, wireless networks, smart cities, and smart transportation systems, among others. However, none of these surveys comprehensively focused on IoT forensics. In addition, several other important aspects of IoT forensics, which are discussed in the current study, have not been previously reported.
The contributions of this study are as follows:

•We explore IoT’s novel factors affecting traditional computer forensics.•We investigate the state-of-the-art research on IoT forensics.•We categorize and classify the literature by devising a taxonomy.•We enumerate a few notable use cases related to IoT forensics.•We outline and highlight the key requirements for enabling IoT forensics.•Finally, we identify and discuss several indispensable open research challenges.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We explain IoT’s novel factors affecting forensics and investigate the recent literature on IoT forensics in Sections 2–3. We discuss the devised taxonomy in Section 4, whereas we identify and present the possible use cases of IoT forensics in Section 5. Then, we outline and enumerate the key requirements for enabling IoT forensics in Section 6, followed by a discussion on several research challenges to be addressed in the IoT forensics paradigm in Section 7. Finally, we conclude the study in Section 8.
