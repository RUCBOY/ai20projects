Most of the people depend on rice as food for their survival in the planet. Rice acts as a source for quick energy, vitamins, minerals, fibers, etc. Several categories of rice, such as white rice, brown rice, jasmine rice, basmati rice, arborio rice, sticky rice, parboiled rice, short grain, medium grain and large grain rice, wild rice, forbidden rice, polished rice, etc., are available in the market. However, it is a very difficult task to protect rice during production as well as after production due to several factors in current scenario. But, damage of rice due to pests during production and after production is an important concern. Several methods can be used to monitor the pests regularly during and after the rice production in order to prevent damage of rice. The monitoring device such as IoT assisted UAV [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] can be used for such purpose. IoT refers to the system of smart devices which receive and transfer data over wireless network without any human intervention [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. The UAV can be considered as an aircraft without any human pilot on board and it is type of unmanned vehicle. UAV is also considered as flying IoT. AI is considered as an essential concern for the identification of pests in the rice field. AI can be referred to the simulation of human intelligence in the machines like UAVs, which are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions for detecting the pests in the rice field. Cloud computing [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52] mechanism plays an important role for the surveillance as well as identification of pest during rice production by the help of high definition UAVs. It refers to the availability of system resources on-demand specifically for computing and data storage without any active management directly by the user. It is mainly used to illustrate data centers which are available to several users through the Internet. As the IoT assisted UAVs will monitor the rice field in regular intervals by capturing the images, so there is requirement of adequate amount of memory for storing as well as processing of several images. Hence, cloud computing can be considered as a solution for this problem by utilizing its several layers, such as application layer and cloud infrastructure layer, and the cloud platform. It is specifically used to store the images captured by IoT assisted UAV for further processing. In this work, we have mainly focused on IoT assisted UAV based pest detection model that uses AI mechanism, Imagga cloud [53] and Python language [54] for the processing of several pest images. The main contributions of this work can be stated as follows.

–An IoT assisted UAV based rice pest detection model focusing on AI mechanism is proposed to identify the pest in the rice during the production in the field.–Imagga cloud [53] is used to provide information related to type of pest that affects the rice. The rice pest images are sent to Imagga cloud by the help of IoT assisted UAV that focuses on Python programming paradigm for providing the pest information. The cloud provides tags to the objects in the image with a confidence value.–The tag with the maximum confidence value and beyond threshold is selected as the target tag to identify the pest.–If the rice is affected by any kind of pests then such information will be send to the field owner immediately in order to take the preventive actions.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Sections 2 Related work, 3 Proposed model, 4 Results and discussion, 5 Conclusion describe the related works, proposed model, results and discussion, and conclusion of the work, respectively.
