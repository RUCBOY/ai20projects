1.1. Challenges in the development of new glassesDeveloping novel glasses with new, improved properties and functionalities is key to address some of the Grand Challenges facing our society [1,2]. Although the process of designing a new material is always a difficult task, the design of novel glasses comes with some unique challenges. First, virtually all the elements of the periodic table can be turned into a glass if quenched fast enough [3]. Second, unlike crystals, glasses are intrinsically out-of-equilibrium and, hence, can exhibit a continuous range in their stoichiometry (within the glass-forming ability domain) [4]. For both of these reasons, the compositional envelope that is accessible to glass is limitless and, clearly, only an infinitesimal fraction of these compositions have been explored thus far [3]. Although the vast compositional envelop accessible to glass opens endless possibilities for the discovery of new glasses with unusual properties, efficiently exploring such a high-dimension space is notoriously challenging and traditional discovery methods based on trial-and-error Edisonian approaches are highly inefficient [5]. Although “intuition” can partially overcome these challenges, it is unlikely to yield a leapfrog in glass properties and functionalities.As a first option, physics-based modeling can greatly facilitate the design of new glasses by predicting a range of optimal promising compositions to focus on [6]. For instance, topological constraint theory has led to the development of several analytical models predicting glass properties as a function of their compositions (e.g., glass transition temperature, hardness, stiffness, etc.) [[7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. However, the complex, disordered nature of glasses renders challenging the development of accurate and transferable physics-based models for certain properties (e.g., liquidus temperature, fracture toughness, dissolution kinetics, etc.) [6]. Alternatively, “brute-force” atomistic modeling techniques (e.g., molecular dynamics) can be used to accurately compute glass properties and partially replace more costly experiments (see also Section 3.5) [13,14]. However, such techniques come with their own challenges (e.g., limited timescale, small number of atoms, fast cooling rate, large computing cost, etc.), which prevents a systematic exploration of all the possible glasses [[15], [16], [17]].
1.2. When machine learning meets glass scienceAs an alternative route to physics-based modeling, artificial intelligence and machine learning offer a promising path to leverage existing datasets and infer data-driven models that, in turn, can be used to accelerate the discovery of novel glasses [11,18]. As a notable success, machine learning modeling techniques have been used to accelerate the design of Corning® Gorilla® glasses [18]. Over the past decade, thanks to the rapid increase in available computing power, artificial intelligence and machine learning have revolutionized various aspects of our lives [19,20], including for image recognition [21], Internet data mining [22], or self-driving cars [23].In details, machine learning can “learn from example” by analyzing existing datasets and identifying patterns in data that are invisible to human eyes [24]. Fig. 1 shows a typical application of machine learning to glass design. First, some data are generated (by experiments, simulations, or mining from existing databases) to build a database of properties. Such databases can comprise, as an example, the glass composition, synthesis procedure, as well as select properties. Machine learning is then used to infer some patterns within the dataset and establish a predictive model [24].Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Illustration of a typical application of machine learning to facilitate glass design.Machine learning algorithms can accomplish two types of tasks, namely, supervised and unsupervised. In the case of supervised machine learning, the dataset comprises a series of inputs (e.g., glass composition) and outputs (e.g., density, hardness, etc.). Supervised machine learning can then learn from these existing examples and infer the relationship between inputs and outputs [25]. Supervised machine learning comprises (i) regression algorithms [26], which can be to predict the output as a function of the inputs (e.g., composition-property predictive models) and (ii) classification algorithms [27], which can be used to label glasses within different categories. In contrast, in the case of unsupervised machine learning, the dataset is not labeled (i.e., no output information is known) [28]. Unsupervised machine learning can, for instance, be used to identify some clusters within existing data, that is, to identify some families of data points that share similar characteristics [29]. More details about these machine learning methods are presented in Section 2.
1.3. Challenges and limitations of machine learning for glass scienceAlthough machine learning offers a unique, largely untapped opportunity to accelerate the discovery of novel glasses with exotic functionalities, it faces several challenges. First, the use of machine learning requires as a prerequisite the existence of data that are (i) available (i.e., public and easily accessible), (ii) complete, (iii) consistent (e.g., obtained from a single operation), (iv) accurate (i.e., with low error bars [30]), and (v) numerous [31]. For instance, although some glass property databases are available [32], inconsistencies between data generated by different groups render challenging the meaningful application of machine learning approaches. In addition, since they are usually only driven by data and do not embed any physics- or chemistry-based knowledge, machine learning models can sometimes violate the laws of physics or chemistry [33,34]. For these reasons, conventional machine learning techniques are usually good at “interpolating” data, but have thus far a limited potential for “extrapolating” predictions far from their initial training set [34,35], which usually prevents the efficient exploration of new unknown compositional domains (see Section 3.2 on how “physics-informed machine learning” can offer improved extrapolations). Finally, machine learning models often offer poor interpretability, that is, they act as black boxes and do not offer clear physical insights [[36], [37], [38]]. Here, we review some recent progress aiming to address and mitigate these challenges.This review is organized as follows. First, Section 2 presents an overview of available machine learning techniques. Section 3 then reviews the state-of-the-art in the application of machine learning to glass science and engineering. Finally, Section 4 offers some conclusions and future directions.
