Forensic Science has been the subject of intense global scrutiny in the last ten years. Key reports from the US and the UK have included the National Academy of Science [1], the Law Commission [2], The annual reports of the UK Forensic Science Regulator [[3], [4], [5], [6]], the UK Government Chief Scientific Adviser annual report [7], the US PCAST report [8], successive UK House of Commons Science and Technology Committee [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]], and the House of Lords Science and Technology Select Committee [14]. The scope and remit of these different reports has been varied, but one issue on which they agree is that forensic science is facing significant challenges locally and globally and ‘profound changes to funding and governance are required to ensure that forensic science survives and begins to flourish rather than lurching from crisis to crisis’ ( [6]:3).
