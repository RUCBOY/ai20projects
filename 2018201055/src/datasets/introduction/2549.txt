Social media (SM) presents an opportunity to unobtrusively access learners’ funds of knowledge because children commonly use SM to capture and share life experiences [1]. As educators gain access to a live stream of children’s everyday experiences through SM, they gain opportunities to facilitate personal connections to academic learning [2], [3]. However, educators are uncertain as to “what counts” as legitimate forms of learning and literacy through SM [4]. Recent studies have found that although both teachers and students are willing to use SM for education and believe it will enhance the educational experience, they rarely incorporate SM into their education practices [5], [6]. In science education, one reason for educators’ hesitation could be that they miss scientifically relevant ideas embedded within children’s SM posts because they are unfamiliar with the social and cultural experiences that children share and the ways in which they share them. How can we understand the interaction features and connected practices that illuminate children’s scientific funds of knowledge in SM sharing?
Our study is situated in a life-relevant science-learning program, called Science Everywhere, designed to help children connect science to everyday life [7]. The Science Everywhere program leverages a SM app to facilitate scientific inquiry that we have iteratively designed over the course of a 5-year design-based research project [8], [9]. Through this process, we have learned that giving children SM tools allows them to share science learning in personally, socially, and culturally relevant ways [2], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].
Our work builds on prior research on SM and learning. Much of this work has examined how youth leverage SM tools for learning (e.g., using Facebook to form study groups or ask classmates about homework) [4], [15]. Our efforts focus on supporting scientific inquiry specifically with SM tools. We have developed several iterations of SM prototypes, and have evidenced how such tools can help children with different participation styles and interests contribute to science inquiry learning environments in new ways and overcome interpersonal conflicts in face-to-face environments [2], [12]. However, one limitation and gap in our previous work was that we piloted the tool in a single constrained setting: an informal learning program that was designed for children [2], [12], [14]. Thus, we were only able to see what children chose to share in that single context. Science Everywhere builds on prior iterations of our design-based research process to understand SM sharing across multiple settings (i.e. home, neighborhood, in-school, and after-school). In this study, we equipped children with mobile devices, installed the current iteration of our SM app, and asked them to share as they went about their everyday lives in different settings. Therefore, children were able to capture and share a wider range of experiences that they related to science.
Our case study explores the rich personal, social, and cultural connections that three focal learners make to science from their everyday contexts when they have ongoing access to SM tools and scaffolding for connecting science to everyday experiences. We use funds of knowledge [16], [17] as a lens to recognize the aspects of science children expressed in their SM sharing so that we could see children’s implicit and more unconventional scientific knowledge.
In the context of the Science Everywhere ecosystem, this study explores the affordances of technology and learning environments that illuminate scientific funds of knowledge, particularly in non-dominant communities where scientific funds of knowledge have a higher likelihood of being overlooked due to traditional educators’ lack of familiarity with diverse cultural idioms, practices, and vernacular [18], [19]. We explore the question, “What information about scientific funds of knowledge can be gleaned through social media sharing?” We found that often, learners’ funds of knowledge were not evident in the posts alone; rather, they emerged through our triangulation of all data sources (i.e., interview transcripts, field notes).
By exploring interconnections between the scientific funds of knowledge that educators readily recognized through the affordances of the Science Everywhere SM platform and those that were missed by SM sharing alone, we deepened our understanding of the diverse ways in which children express scientific funds of knowledge in SM across contexts. We leverage our emerging insights of these cross-context possibilities to develop design implications for both the design of SM technologies for STEM learning and the design of learning environments that leverage SM tools. Therefore, our study also addresses the question, “What are design implications to connect funds of knowledge that children share on social media to scientific concepts?”
