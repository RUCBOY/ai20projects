Scientific research today is expanding in many disciplines. Applied Science aware of the development of technological innovation and its impact on society as a whole applies itself to transform abstract theories into practical applications.
In 1788, L. H. Jakob defined “applied science” as an a-posteriori knowledge resulting from an experiment. Today, the discipline may be characterized more extensively as using knowledge to extracts results and solve practical problems [1]. Applied Surface Science, an even more recent branch of Applied Sciences focuses on the study and a greater comprehending of surfaces, interfaces, nanostructures, and their applications. It aims to comprehend the structure, processes, dynamics, and performance of surfaces and interfaces, how these determine chemical and physical properties, and create new tools and strategies to do so [2].
Visual communication is a discipline that relates to Applied Sciences inasmuch that both use a common language to interpret and share information in a visual format. Additionally, the design element of visual communication is built on what many interpret as fine - art. E. Schatzberg judiciously pointed that in the nineteenth century the concept of fine art gradually displaced the broader meanings of “art,” thus undermining the utility of the term for discourse on the relationship between knowledge and practice [3].
Applying principles of a recent methodology used by computer scientists and architect, called Knowledge Visualization, I conducted a research project combining applied surface science practices and visual art techniques to evaluate if an experiment focusing on Nano size crystal modelling could generate an outcome consistent with the Knowledge Visualization framework and be beneficial to the interpreting and sharing of scientific images.
