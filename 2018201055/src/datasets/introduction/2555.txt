Some cyber attacks have occurred during the last three years, which was viewed as impossible in the traditional secure opinion. For example, an air-gapped computer is no longer secure under some cyber attacks. And there are a number of attack means that allow an attacker to theft information from an air-gapped computer at present. A network weapon called “suter”, which is developed by the US air force (Dacid, 2012), is employed to attack the air-gapped military computers. Using this technique, the Israelis successfully invaded the Syrian air defense radar network and take over its control (The Israeli ‘E-tack’ on Syria, 2008), in a military action attacking nuclear facilities on Syrian border from the air. In fact, these air-gapped attacks invalidated the Syrian air defense radar network. As a result, the Israeli Air Force successfully implemented the bombing and returned from the same route.
The successful cases of cyber attacks further stimulate the rapid development of the air-gapped attack technique. The new intrusion techniques are emerging. And this type of attacks has been developed to theft data from an air-gapped computer using the thermal emission (Guri, Monitz, Mirski, & Elovici, 2015), electromagnetic radiation (Guri, Kachlon, et al., 2015), radio emissions (Guri, Monitz, & Elovici, 2017b), ultrasonic (Guri, Solewicz, et al., 2017, Hanspach and Goetz, 2014a, Hanspach and Goetz, 2014b), USB devices (Guri, Monitz, & Elovici, 2017a) and light emitted by hard disk drive (Guri, Zadov, & Elovici, 2017) respectively.
GSMem attack is one kind of the representative air-gapped attacks. As a malware, GSMem can exfiltrate data through an air-gap over cellular frequencies (Guri, Kachlon, et al., 2015). However, none of the existing Intrusion Detection (ID) techniques can detect GSMem attacks. To address this problem, we introduce a ML method to detect GSMem attacks. This is the main contribution of this paper.
