The world is witnessing the Fourth Industrial Revolution (FIR) that is characterized by combining digital, physical and biological worlds. [1] argues that this era is marked by several breakthroughs in advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), Robotics, quantum computing, Internet of Things (IoT) and fifth-generation wireless technologies (5G). FIR is also known as “Industry 4.0” [2]. On the other hand, Climate change, population growth, transportation, international security issues, and globalisation are the main challenges for future urban development [3]. Therefore, the right assembly of emerging technologies, components, skills, and needs can deliver smart/future city objectives [4]. Examples of these objectives are developing or generating new services, a delicacy of management, smart infrastructure, sustainability and facilitating planning.
The most crucial application of integrating the digital and physical worlds are Automated Driving (AD) and Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) [5], [6]. The former will give rise to new mobility concepts and opportunities as well as it will expand the transport system capacity and efficiency. These technologies will radically change the transportation infrastructure and will impact future planning. The adoption of AVs in future/smart cities is associated with many potential benefits. However, from analysing existing literature, it has been noted that many scholars place a high emphasis on safety. This aspect is usually addressed in line with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report, which in turn suggests the use of “highly effective crash avoidance technologies” to prevent crashes [7]. This criterion implies that AVs driving systems must be as robust as aviation standards [8]. It is crucial to go through different types and levels of automation to understand how autonomous cars will perform and behave. The more computers are doing the level of assistance provided by machines, the fewer humans’ intervention, and the more functions, the more automated level is becoming higher. Hence, Table 1 illustrates the five levels of automation suggested by the NHTSA. These levels range from no input from machines which is level 0 to full automation which is level 4.Table 1. NHTSA's levels of Vehicle Automation reproduced from [7].Level 0No-AutomationLevel 1Function-specific AutomationLevel 2Combined Function AutomationLevel 3Limited Self-Driving AutomationLevel 4Full Self-Driving Automation
It is anticipated that AVs will increase safety and comfort [7], [9], and reduce traffic congestions, pollution, fuel consumption, as well as facilitate further the mobility accessibility to disable and older people. Also, self-driving will decrease the number of accidents and crashes through the vehicle to vehicle communication [8], [10]. Besides safety, several scholars have discussed further in prospect benefits of adopting AVs, as shown in Table 2. [11] argues that since internet emergence, AVs will be the most substantial change and transition that will happen to societies and cities.Table 2.

As AVs will bring several benefits, it could also be associated with several potential risks. For example, the digitisation of the transport system can be vulnerable to hacking [15], [19], [33]. Furthermore, [12], [13], [34] claim that AVs could be exposed to system failure. Another hazard that can be linked to AVs is malicious cyberattacks through a non-trusted network [34]. Not only risks are cybernetically related, but also other hazards can be associated with AVs such as using both modes of driving (Manual and automated) can lead to miscommunication [35].
Extensive research is being conducted on AVs and their potential effects on many aspects of our lives. However, access to these benefits will have to overcome several obstacles. Many researchers have addressed these obstacles, and some have suggested several solutions to surpass AVs holdbacks. Table 3 summarises the selected reviews that discussed the most critical problems facing AVs based on their date of publication and number of citations. Interestingly, most of these problems are related to technology and users’ behaviour. For example, we find that many scholars have focused more on technological and technical issues studying vehicular communications, and sensors technologies. Starting from the principle that they come to the most important barrier that must be overcome. At the same time, but to a lesser extent, some reviews have pointed out other obstacles, especially in the study of behaviour and to what extent people accept this new technology. Based on the above, this review attempts to integrate all the obstacles discussed by the previous studies. Thus, the purpose of this review is not only to determine these obstacles but to employ a mixed research method to extract other barriers and study the extent of their overlap.Table 3.

It is crucial to understand how these emerging technologies can be managed and tackle their challenges. Precisely, to achieve AVs benefits, we must start planning, deploying policies and realise their advantages and disadvantages [49]. Therefore, it is evident that the adoption of AVs could have many advantages, and it is impractical to attain such benefits without understanding and tackling different barriers/ obstacles associated with its approval. In other words, to understand and evaluate the effects and changes that AVs can cause in our cities, it is imperative to explore and comprehend firstly, the mechanism of how an AV works (Vehicle specifications) or what is called “Autonomous vehicle system architecture”. Secondly, identify the various barriers that restrain the adoption of these technologies because this will help to define the required infrastructures that ensure the smooth performance and safety of AVs.
Although there exists a considerable amount of work addressing the potential benefits, barriers and risks of AVs, there is no study that has reviewed all obstacles of AVs in one review. For those reasons, this paper aims to examine various barriers and challenges to the AVs implementation, meanwhile studying their interrelatedness. Also, this study suggests a developed conceptual framework showing the AVs system architecture and how the possible obstacles are linked to it. Furthermore, the proposed framework of this study considers the highest automation level, which is Level 4 (Full Self-Driving Automation) Table 1.
The review is structured into four sections. Firstly, section 1 discusses the background of the subject highlighting the benefits and risks of AVs as well as the focus of existing research. Secondly, section 2 outlines the research methodology applied to achieve the aim of this review which is a mixed-methods research methodology. Thirdly, section 3 presents the findings of the study and combines the barriers to full adoption into two main groups. Finally, section 4 summarises the findings and proposes a framework assembling the barriers that are needed to overcome linked to AVs 'system architecture.
