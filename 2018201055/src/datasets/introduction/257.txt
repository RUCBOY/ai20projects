Brain Computer Interface (BCI) is an advanced technology for human-computer interaction [1], which aims to construct a direct information channel between human brain and external hardware devices. The user's electroencephalography (EEG) is decoded and converted into the instructions of the computer or control system to realize the brain's direct control for external hardware devices [2].BCI technology provides a new communication and control method for patients with physical inconvenience to realize wheelchair manipulation [3], prosthetic limb control [4], stimulation of nerve recovery [5] and other functions by using brain ideas. In addition, this technology has also been applied in virtual reality games [6], military communication control [7], operator fatigue state detection [8,9] and other medical fields.
BCI systems can induce different EEG signals according to different experimental paradigms. The most common experimental paradigms include motor imagination(MI), steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP), event-related potential(ERP) [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]] and hybrid BCI stimulation potential [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. Among them, SSVEP signal has a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and a shorter response time [19]. And the SSVEP-based BCI showed its unique characteristics of high information transformation rate and low training demand for subjects [20]. Therefore, SSVEP signal has received extensive attention in the related researches of BCI systems [21] in recent studies. The EEG signal collected by electrodes on the scalp surface has the advantages of high temporal resolution, non-invasive and low cost, becoming the most widely used acquisition method in BCI systems [22].
The traditional SSVEP identification method used Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to perform power spectral density analysis (PSDA) of EEG signals. Target frequency was identified by detecting the peak frequency [23,24]. Or PSDA method was used as a feature extraction method, followed by supervised machine learning algorithm training [25,26] to identify target frequencies. In recent years, multichannel-based correlation analysis methods have been widely used in the recognition of SSVEP signals [27,28]. Among them, canonical correlation analysis (CCA) algorithm and multivariable synchronization index (MSI) algorithm are the main frequency identification methods adopted by SSVEP-based BCI systems [[29], [30], [31], [32], [33]]. The CCA algorithm was proposed by Gao et al. [34] of Tsinghua University, which showed significant performance over the traditional algorithms in the recognition process of SSVEP signals; the MSI algorithm was proposed by Zhang et al. [35] for SSVEP recognition and achieved 86 % recognition accuracy in an online system.
However, both methods are limited by the fact that the sine-cosine reference signals cannot fully reflect the characteristics of the subjects and the characteristics of the harmonic components of the EEG signals [36,37]. In the study of SSVEP brain-computer interface, Wang et al. [36] incorporated training EEG signal into reference signal and proposed a typical correlation algorithm based on individual template data (ITCCA), which significantly increased the correlation coefficient difference between target frequency and non-target frequency, and improved the recognition accuracy of CCA algorithm by 6.8 % in 10 subjects. Chen et al. [37] proposed a typical correlation algorithm based on the filter bank(Filter Bank CCA, FBCCA) which effectively utilized SSVEP fundamental frequency components and harmonic components and improved the recognition accuracy of CCA algorithm by 12.67 % in 10 subjects [38].
In the previous research works of this paper, it was found that in the process of SSVEP signal recognition, the results of single sine-cosine harmonic calculation can get better recognition than MSI algorithm through different coefficient combinations. The combined coefficients are called harmonic sensitivity coefficients in this study. In order to improve the robustness of the algorithm, the calculation results of coefficient combinations are mixed with those of standard MSI algorithm in different proportions. But simply using a single sine-cosine wave cannot get a stable improvement effect. Inspired by ITCCA in [36], the individual template of the subject is added to the single sine-cosine wave reference signal. In order to reduce the redundant information in individual templates, the frequency domain enhancement mapping of individual templates is carried out by CCA method. And the Individual signal mixing template MSI (IST-MSI) algorithm was proposed. On the basis of standard MSI algorithm, the individual template enhanced by frequency domain energy is added into the single corresponding sine-cosine harmonic reference signal. After the unequal ratio scaling of harmonic sensitivity coefficient, it is mixed and added with the calculation result of the standard MSI algorithm to make the final calculation results. Finally, the synchronization index at non-target frequencies identified by standard MSI algorithms are significantly reduced, resulting in a sharp peak in target frequencies, which improves the recognition accuracy of MSI algorithm. The IST-MSI algorithm is applied to the SSVEP classification of 6 target frequency stimuli in 6-bit subjects, and compared with the standard MSI algorithm. The reduction of training set and the optimal structure of individual template are analyzed and discussed in the framework of IST-MSI algorithm.
The following chapters are arranged as follows: Section 2 introduced the signal acquisition and data preprocessing, Section 3 introduced the IST-MSI algorithm flow proposed in this paper, Section 4 discussed and analyzed the results of IST-MSI algorithm, and Section 5 discussed and summarized the results.
