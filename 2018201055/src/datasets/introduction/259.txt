With the development of intelligent transportation, environment perception, as an essential task for autonomous driving, has become a research hotspot. Lane detection is an important part of environmental perception. Many efforts have been done during the last decades. However, it is still a challenge to develop a robust detector under unlimited conditions. Because there are too many variables, such as fog, rain, illumination variation, and partial occlusion. They may have effects on the final results.
Pre-processing steps play an important role in heuristic recognition-based lane detection methods. To remove unwanted noise, many filters are used, including mean, median [1], Gaussian [2], and FIR [3] filters. To deal with illumination variation, the general solutions employ threshold segmentation [4] algorithm, including Otsu [5], and PLSF [6], etc. The region of interest (ROI) is usually used to reduce redundant information. Fixed-size ROI [7], vanishing point-based ROI [2] and adaptive ROI [8] have been widely explored. Color is another information for pre-processing. Color space conversion between RGB and YCbCr or HLS is generally used to enhance the quality of lane mark.
Feature extraction and lane modeling are critical for obtaining mathematical description of lanes. Many algorithms including Sobel [7], Canny [9], FIR filter [10], and Hough transform [11] are applied to extract feature. Many algorithms model lanes as straight lines. For modeling curves, parabolic [12], Catmull-Rom spline [13], cubic B-spline [2], and clothoid curve [14] are used. In complex conditions, inverse perspective transformation   [15], image enhancement [16], stereo camera [17], and wavelet analysis [18] are used.
In 2012, convolutional neural networks (CNN) AlexNet [19] won the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC). Since then, deep learning algorithms became a promising tool. Over the past several years, via multi-layer nonlinear transforms, deep learning has achieved promising results in many fields. A variety of deep learning methods have been applied to tackle the lane detection task. Range from early CNN-based method (e.g., [20,21]) to end-to-end segmentation-based methods (e.g., GCN [22], SCNN [23]), GAN-based method (e.g., EL-GAN [24]), et al. In addition, knowledge distillation [25], attention map [26] have brought new ideas for lane detection (e.g., SAD [27]). How to understand the structure of lane lines from the perspective of directed acyclic graphica, DAGMapper [28] gives a good explanation. Although promising results have been achieved, the lack of generalization ability is still a main challenge of existing methods. A CNN trained in one scenario may perform less accurate in other, especially at night.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first article to make a comprehensive review of recent deep learning-based lane detection algorithms. The rest of the survey is arranged as follows. Section 2 describes the background of relative CNN. Section 3 describes CNN architectures, loss functions, pre-processing, and post-processing of deep learning-based lane detection algorithms. In Section 4, we do some experiments to demonstrate four state-of-the-art and representative algorithms. The conclusion and future work are discussed in Section 5.
