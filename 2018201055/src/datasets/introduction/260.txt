Pulmonary embolism (PE) refers to the situation that a portion of a blood clot remains in the pulmonary artery (Fig. 1), which ranks as the third most common cardiovascular disease. The small blood clots in the pulmonary arteries will block blood flow to lung, which can lead to insufficient oxygen supply to vital organs [1]. Early detection and treatment of PE could effectively decrease the mortality rate. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) has become one of the main methods for diagnosing PE today [2] since manual diagnosis of PE is a time-consuming and laborious task where the current best radiologists have a range of 6–23% misdiagnosis rate [1]. Computer-aided detection methods have been developed for aiding the radiologists in PE detection automatically. However, the traditional automatic PE detection methods [3], [4], [5], [6] could not perform successfully since the area of many PE lesions is generally with small size and irregular shape.Download : Download high-res image (124KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

In recent years, Mask R-CNN [7], a kind of deep neural network framework, has been developed for object detection and instance segmentation. [8] applied Mask R-CNN for the detection and segmentation of oral diseases. [9] demonstrated that Mask R-CNN can efficiently and automatically segment microscope images of various nuclei. Mask R-CNN performs well in both large and medium objects detection and segmentation, while it underperforms with small objects [10].
Small object detection can usually be addressed by enlarging feature maps of original images. [11] proposed an upsampling-based anchor generation scheme using the high-resolution feature map of small objects. [12] designed a codec framework with symmetric convolutional deconvolution layer, which could improve the resolution of the feature map to make it better perform on small object detection. These approaches improve detection accuracy by changing the network structure to retain the information of small objects as much as possible. However, the anchor extraction strategy has a significant influence on the detection performance of small objects. Many anchor boxes with multiple scales and aspect ratios are generally designed manually on the entire image to match objects with various aspect ratios and spatial layout [13]. Due to the limited size of the feature map, few suitable anchors match small objects. Magnifying feature maps can alleviate the issue, but it will increase both time and space consumption. In most cases, anchors are extracted on the entire image with equal strides. Thus, a large number of invalid anchors are probably generated, which will decrease the final detection performance. Most anchor extraction methods imply a hypothesis that the probability of objects appearing on an image is subject to a uniform distribution, as investigated in [14].
Clinical diagnosis based on the medical image has shown the area prone to lesions is usually a small part of the entire image. For example, in clinical coronary artery calcification quantification, calcified areas generally distribute a narrow area around the coronary artery [15]. In breast cancer examination, the diseased tissue always appears in the internal area of the breast in the image [16]. On detection of PE, most plaques in CTPAs appeared on the left or right pulmonary artery, as well as its branches. Based on the clinical medical prior knowledge, it is reasonable to take into consideration the probability of lesion’s appearance at various positions in the medical image. Specifically, we construct a candidate area for the original image based on probability and then extract anchors in the corresponding candidate area of the enlarged feature map for subsequent detection and segmentation. The proposed model, namely probability-based Mask R-CNN (P-Mask RCNN), can improve small PE object detection precision without increasing time and space overhead.
The major contributions of our work are threefold:
• We propose that the probability distribution characteristics of lesions is a kind of significant factor to narrow the scope of detection and thus improve detection accuracy for medical image processing.
• A new framework for small object detection in the medical image is proposed. The performance of small object detection can be improved significantly by combining the probability-based anchor extraction strategy with appropriate feature map upsampling.
• Our approach upgrades the AP, AP50 and AP75 from 37.55%, 77.39% and 33.21% to 41.87%, 81.55% and 41.43%, respectively, on small PE object detection task, compared with that of Mask R-CNN.
