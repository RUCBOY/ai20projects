It has been recognized that synchronization is a universal concept in nonlinear sciences [1], [2]. Among them, chaos synchronization, as an important branch, has received great attention since the seminal work of Pecora and Carroll [3]. The importance originates from its broad relevance ranging from the human cardiorespiratory system [4], electrosensitive cells of the paddlefish [5] to ecological science [6]. A variety of synchronization states, such as complete synchronization [3], lag synchronization [7], phase synchronization [8], and generalized synchronization [1], are emerging. These intensive studies not only enrich our understanding of the mechanism underlying synchronization phenomena appearing in nature, but also foster the widely potential applications, for example, secure communications [9], [10] and physiological modeling [11].
However, most previous works rely on the prerequisite that the equations of chaotic systems are known, which is often impossible in practice. In fact, one or some observational signals are usually available for the majority of real chaotic systems [12]. In this circumvent, an alternative way is to referring machine learning techniques for modeling real systems of interest. Recently, a machine learning technique known as “reservoir computing” has attracted considerable attention [13], [14], [15]. A growing number of studies have demonstrated that this approach is an effective model-free technique for dealing with low-dimensional chaos [16] as well as large spatiotemporally chaotic systems [17]. Here, we adopt this effective technique for modeling and predicting hyperchaotic systems — multiple positive Lyapunov exponents. Since this feature improves security by giving rise to more complex time signals, hyperchaotic systems are more competent in secure communications [18], [19].
In this paper, we consider chaos synchronism of hyperchaotic subsystems whose equations are unknown beforehand. We adopt the reservoir computing approach for capturing its evolutionary. We find that synchronization of hyperchaotic subsystems emerges via only a single variable. In particular, by sending one dynamical variable, the trained reservoir computer will synchronize with its learned hyperchaotic subsystem. We further show that in the same manner, the synchronization phenomenon will consequently appear in the trained reservoir computers. Moreover, we analyze the robustness of this synchronization behavior by introducing observational noise to the transmitting signal. Our findings reveal that the reservoir computing approach can be adopted for achieving synchronization of hyperchaotic subsystems.
