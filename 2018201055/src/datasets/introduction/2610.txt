With the development of computer technology and the popularization of Internet, more and more enterprises and institutions are carrying out informatization transformation. Through the deep development and wide utilization of information resources, the efficiency and level of production, operation, management and decision-making are constantly improved, thus improving the economic benefits and competitiveness of enterprises. Museum services available to the public as a unit, is facing similar problems, an urgent need to analysis the facing problems and tasks, overall arrangement, the reasonable configuration, optimizing the combination of financial, human and technical resources [1], [2], [3], [4], improve collection management, scientific research, display, public service, the social education, the overall level of museum management [5]. The traditional management of museum collections is very heavy, tedious and monotonous, which requires manual classification, registration, maintenance and repair of all kinds of collections [20], [27], [28], [29]. Moreover, it takes a lot of time to search the needed collections, and it is often difficult to operate the collections, which is also likely to cause accidental damage to the collections. If the museum advertising picture management system is used, it can bring about great changes to the management of the museum and greatly improve the work efficiency [6], [7]. Specifically, it has practical significance in the following aspects:
(1)Improve the utilization rate of the collection is the main object of the daily work of the museum. The traditional working method is not only time-consuming and laborious, but also error-prone and inefficient. For example, if a user wants to know the information of a collection that he or she is interested in, apart from the security in the use of the collection, it is also a headache to search item by item from a large number of records of the collection. If multiple people are involved, it may cause repeated work. Through the use of the museum advertising picture management system, the information of the collection can be searched for various combination conditions, which greatly brings convenience to users [8].(2)To achieve the automatic archiving, business card printing work of the daily management of an important work is the collation and accumulation of the collection of data, the need for archiving, the production of information CARDS, all by hand, it takes a lot of manpower and time, to complete these tedious work, and may be wrong [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. After using the collection management system, the original work of setting up files and making information CARDS was replaced by keyboard input. Only the collection information was input into the collection management system according to categories. The system judged the entry options legally, greatly reducing the probability of errors in the entry process. If you need to search, you only need to input the corresponding query conditions to quickly retrieve the results that meet the conditions. For the collection information that needs to communicate with other personnel, you can also print out and generate paper materials for convenient communication and preservation. Compared with the information of traditional hand-copied collections, if the collection has thousands of pieces, even if five or six people work together, it will take several weeks [9].(3)Realize the sharing of cultural relics resources. The computer collection management system can query and browse the collection information input at the early stage, log in multiple points through the local area network, and operate the collection information database to achieve the purpose of resource sharing. Even if professionals modify and adjust the information in the database, it will not affect other users' query use of resources. The application of the online version of the computer collection management system can maximize the resource utilization of the collection and make the information exchange and research between various museums and regions more convenient [10].
As the most powerful witness of the customs, culture and historical development of a region, the museum is of great significance to the protection, research, exhibition, culture and education of the cultural relics collected in the museum. With the development of computer science and technology, digital technology has gradually image into all aspects of our life, almost every field of life has the existence of digital, people access to information in an increasingly diversified and convenient way. In order to enable people to browse the cultural relic information of the museum more conveniently and quickly, break the limitation of time and space, and improve the efficiency of museum staff in the management of collection information, the museum has also started to develop towards the direction of digitalization [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. However, the existing digital museum in the design, implementation, technology and system architecture, there are many shortcomings, main show is inaccurate concept definition, implementation of technical characteristics is not bright, design scheme and implementation means not, digital display technology are not fixed, the overall design scheme of the lack of harmonious systematic. The inconsistency in development technology and the incompleteness in functional design have brought great difficulties to the unification and integration of digital museums in the future [16].
The existing digital image file management systems currently on the market are generally based on the C/S (client/server) architecture [17], [18]. The C/S architecture mode means the layer 2 running architecture mode of the client and server (Client/Server). This kind of architecture has been popular for a while, but with the increasing number of users, its shortcomings, narrow user base, and high maintenance costs have gradually become prominent [19], [20], [21], [22]. Nowadays, web applications based on B/S (browser/server) architecture have begun to enter people's field of vision. B/S architecture means the browser and server (Browser/Server) running architecture. The architecture application generally only needs to run with IE or Chrome, FireFox and other browsers. The web application is generally B/S architecture. This mode is a three-layer architecture mode, namely browser, web server. There are also database servers [23], [24], [25], [26]. The web application based on B/S architecture has the following advantages: no need to install the client, B/S architecture can be directly placed on the Internet, and use the allocation of permissions to reach multiple users. The target of the access, the interaction is relatively strong, and the B/S architecture only needs to update the server when updating, which can greatly reduce the maintenance cost and improve the efficiency.
This paper proposes a web-based museum advertisement picture management system. The system architecture has good scalability and perfects the existing digital museum system from the perspective of information system management. In addition, it can ensure that users can meet the requirements of extensive, accurate and fast access to cultural relics information, and can regulate and simplify the management process of cultural relics information, and improve the efficiency of museum staff. It provides an effective solution to realize the information sharing of digital museum cultural relics and the full utilization of resources.
