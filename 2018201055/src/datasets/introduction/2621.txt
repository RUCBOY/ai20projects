Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most prominent cancer among men, next only to lung cancer. It is estimated that there will be nearly 1,74,650 of new incidences and 31,620 prostate cancer-related deaths in the United States during 2019. PCa accounts for nearly 1 in 5 new cancer diagnoses among men [1]. Early diagnosis and treatment planning is significant in reducing the mortality rate due to PCa.
The Gleason Score (GS) is a standard for measuring the aggressiveness of Prostate cancer. The Gleason Score is the sum of two Gleason grades that are most common in a lesion pattern [2]. The pathologist assigns a Gleason grade on a scale of 3–5 based on the pattern of cancer cells in the prostate. PCa is divided into 5 different grade groups based on the Gleason Score [3]. Gleason Score <= 6 are categorized into Grade Group (GG) 1 and a Gleason Score ≥ 7 is categorized into GG 2 (GS 3 + 4 = 7), GG 3 (GS 4 + 3 = 7), GG 4 (GS 4 + 4 = 8, GS 3 + 5 = 8, GS 5 + 3 = 8) and GG 5 (GS = 9, GS = 10) based on cancer aggressiveness [4]. Doctors predict the prospect of recovery based on the grade group [4]. Lesions categorized as GG 1 are considered clinically insignificant and those categorized as GG 2, GG 3, GG 4 and GG 5 are considered clinically significant [5]. No treatment is required for clinically insignificant cancer, but active surveillance is needed [6]. Accurate prediction of grade is required to prevent overtreatment of clinically insignificant tumors and to ensure prompt treatment for clinically significant prostate cancer [7].
Screening of PCa is done using Digital Rectal Examination (DRE), estimating Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) level and Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy [8]. Histopathologic verification is used for confirming the diagnosis [8]. Treatment planning is done based on the grade group of a lesion assigned by the pathologist based on the microscopic examination of histological images [9]. TRUS biopsy often leads to over-diagnosis of clinically insignificant cancers, and poor-diagnosis of clinically significant ones [10]. Recent studies show that MRI can be used for the diagnosis as well as the grading of PCa [11,12]. Computer-aided diagnosis techniques could assist the radiol-ogist in estimating the grade of PCa from MRI, which is time-consuming and stressful if done manually.
Few recent studies perform computer-aided classification between clinically significant and clinically insignificant PCa. A pioneering method for classification of clinically-significant and clinically insignificant PCa was done by Fehr et al. [13]. The method utilized texture feature, RFE-SVM classifier and SMOTE based upsampling of instances in minority classes. Subsequently, the International Society for Optics and Photonics (SPIE) along with the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) organized a grand challenge for the classification of clinically-significant and indolent lesions [14]. Methods by Seah et al. [15] and Liu et al. [16] used Convolutional Neural Networks and Kitchen et al. [17] used SVM to achieve significant results in the PROSTATEx test dataset. The methods by Le et al. [18] and Wang et al. [19] using Convolutional Neural Networks achieved good performance using the training dataset of the challenge along with a private dataset. Abraham et al. [20] used features extracted using sparse autoencoders and the random forest classifier to distinguish between clinically significant and clinically insignificant Pca, using the training dataset of PROSTATEx, after balancing instances using ADASYN.
Following the PROSTATEx challenge, AAPM, SPIE, and NCI conducted PROSTATEx-2 grand challenge for the grading of PCa into 5 grade groups [14]. The method submitted by the authors won the challenge, achieving a Quadratic Weighted Kappa value of 0.2772 [21] in the highly imbalanced PROSTATEx-2 dataset. The method also achieved a positive predictive value PPVGG>1 of 0.80 in predicting clinically significant prostate cancer. The method used texture features as input and produced deep features using a stacked sparse autoencoder [21]. In a recent work, the authors used the Inception-V3 pre-trained network and LADTree classifier to achieve a fair quadratic weighted kappa score [22]. In another study, Jensen et al. [23] performed binary classification of GG1, GG2, GG (1 + 2), GG 3 and GG (4 + 5) to achieve significant results using image histogram and texture features in combination with the k-nearest neighbor classifier. However, instead of multi-class classification into 5 grade groups, they have combined the GG 4 and GG 5 of PROSTATEx-2 datasets and performed classification of GG (4 + 5) as a separate category. As the grading of prostate cancer into 5 grade groups from MR images is a relatively new area of research, there exist only a few published works in this area. The published works in the literature for the grading of prostate cancer into 5 grade groups from MRI are those described in Refs. [21,22].
The above-mentioned works have few limitations worth mentioning. Most of the existing techniques [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]] are able to distinguish between high-grade and low-grade PCa only, and not between all of the 5 grade groups. Even though the winning method of PROSTATEx-2 challenge achieved a fair quadratic weighted kappa score, it was unable to predict any cancer belonging to GG 4 [21]. The subsequent method was unable to predict any lesion belonging to GG 5. The method described in Ref. [23] performed classification of prostate cancer into different grade groups after combining GG 4 and GG 5 only. No existing methods have reported a moderate quadratic weighted kappa score above 0.40.
None of the existing works considered the ordinal nature of the grading problem. State-of-the-art techniques have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [24], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [18], Softmax [21], and LADTree [22] for classification of ordinal prostate cancer data. However, a number of works in the literature have shown that the Ordinal Class Classifier (OCC) is effective in the classification of imbalanced classification problems of ordinal nature. Perez et al. [25] used the Ordinal Class Classifier for the classification of highly imbalanced melanoma images of ordinal nature. Cardoso et al. [26] used OCC for the aesthetic evaluation of breast cancer conservative treatment. The proposed method explores the use of OCC in combination with high-level features extracted from CNN for the grading of PCa.
The proposed method has the following contributions.
1.The method is the first one in the literature to use the combination of VGG-16 pre-trained CNN along with OCC for PCa diagnosis.2.Even though there exist several methods for predicting clinically significant PCa using binary classification, this method is one among the few to perform multi-class classification for predicting clinically significant PCa.3.The method is the first one in the literature to achieve a moderate quadratic weighted kappa score using the PROSTATEx-2 challenge dataset.
