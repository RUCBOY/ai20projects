Discrimination and societal stereotypes against specific groups are still affecting a large number of people today and have very complex social roots. Even the concerned groups sometimes may normalize and reproduce the stereotypes against themselves while evaluating it as common sense. Increased use of computers and technology may be defined today as a remedy of long-lived inequalities in society, but it is also true that technology has not affected all groups in a society in the same way. Technology is advancing while leaving some people behind and may perpetuate precisely same inequalities in a digitalized world. It is called “digital divide” which is “a term that has been used to refer to the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not, between those who have the expertise and training to utilize technology and those who do not” (Cooper & Weaver, 2003, p. 3). The digital divide is not only caused by lack of ownership or use of technology. Furthermore, negative/positive stereotypes, narrowly prescribed social roles and norms which have been installed in people's minds throughout their lifespan could feed on this digital divide and maintain their presence in a virtual world maybe even more efficiently and sophistically than the real one.
A digital divide also exists between men and women in which women cannot access and take advantage of technology as much as men do. The computer is not inherently gendered however it has been constructed socially as a male domain which causes “computer-phobia” among women (Cooper & Kugler, 2009; Turkle, 1986). The use, liking and competence of computer technology are associated with being a male (Brosnan & Davidson, 1996) as a result of the existing gender stereotypes and societal expectations which also put females in a disadvantaged position in the process. Several studies in the past stated that attitudes toward technology differ significantly between males and females in terms of interest, knowledge and competence (Cooper, Wilder, & Mackie, 1985; Bame, Dugger, de Vries, & McBee, 1993; Durndell, Glissov, & Siann, 1997; Comber, Colley, Hargreaves, & Dorn, 1997; Nelson & Cooper, 1997; Young, 2000; Margolis & Fisher, 2001; Hale, 2002; Dickhauser & Stiensmeyer-Pelster, 2002). According to Margolis and Fisher (2001) and Cooper and Kugler (2009), these gender differences toward computer and technology are childhood patterns originated from boys' and girls’ different socialization process and must be understood as a way to cope with prescribed gender roles and social norms.
There is a current tendency in many countries for adopting a new K-12 curriculum to start teaching computing and programming to children from earlier ages; aiming to create potential innovators with high order skills such as logical reasoning, algorithmic and computational thinking (Repenning, Webb, & Ioannidou, 2010; Bargury et al., 2012; Jones, 2013; Grout & Houlden, 2014; Grgurina, Barendsen, Zwaneveld, van Veen, & Stoker, 2014; Lee, Martin, & Apone, 2014). According to many researches, teaching programming to children with game playing affect their thinking skills positively and almost all of the children start to develop a positive attitude to learning computing and programming after the game play (Fessakis, Gouli, & Mavroudi, 2013; Bers, Flannery, Kazakoff, & Sullivan, 2014; Kalelioğlu, Gülbahar, Akçay, & Doğan, 2014). Thus, game playing seems to be a promising approach to get children interested in computer science but game design is what really matters for eliminating gender inequity in computer programming. It is crucial that both genders should be equally encouraged to improve their self-esteem and competence while learning coding since perceived competence is immensely associated with enjoyment and future intention to engage in a specific task (Gorriz and Medina, 2000; Ryan, Rigby, & Przybylski, 2006; Plass et al., 2007)
The difference between the two genders still exists in terms of computer literacy, interest, self-competence, self-efficacy,1 probability to choose computer science as a career, and having positive attitudes towards programming (He & Freeman, 2009; Kiss, 2010; Burnett et al., 2010; Huffman, Wheten, & Huffman, 2013; Singh, Bhadauria, Jain, & Gurung, 2013; Papavlasopoulou, Jaccheri, & Giannakos, 2016). Currently, many efforts to broaden participation of female students (especially for middle school girls) in computing and programming are being conducted (Denner, Werner, Bean, & Campe, 2005; Denner, Werner, & Ortiz, 2012). Several studies developed new ways in order to make coding « an approachable and natural activity » for girls by developing construction-based gaming environments which enable visual storytelling such as Alice, Kodu and Scratch (Kelleher & Pausch, 2006; Maloney, Peppler, Kafai, Resnick, & Rusk, 2008; Hutchinson, Moskal, Cooper, & Dann, 2008; Baytak & Land, 2011; Fristoe, Denner, MacLaurin, Mateas, & Wardrip-Fruin, 2011) combined with designing artifacts such as wearable e-textile technologies (Buechley, Eisenberg, Catchen, & Crockett, 2008; Giannakos & Jaccheri, 2013; Kafai, et al., 2014; Kafai & Vasudevan, 2015) in summer camps and special programs (Graham & Latulipe, 2003; Craig & Horton, 2009; Burge, Gannod, Doyle, & Davis, 2013; Giannakos, Jaccheri, & Leftheriotis, 2014, pp. 398–409). These studies were conducted with the aim of providing girls the opportunity to be game constructors which would allow them to construct their own knowledge and to transcend preconceived gender images. It was revealed that these gender neutral game environments may help to motivate, build self-esteem and foster computational thinking of especially female students.
Morever, this suggests that it is important to reveal intrinsic and extrinsic barriers which keep young girls from being interested and/or choosing a career in computer science and explore new approaches to attract young females to the field of computer science before gender stereotypes and negative thoughts about computer science sit in (Armoni & Gal-Ezer, 2014; Prottsman, 2014). Because, if a female's early experience with software is discouraging and negative, it is not very likely that she will choose a career path in computer and technology (Beckwith, Burnett, & Grigoreanu, 2006, pp. 97–101; Rosson, Carroll, & Sinha, 2011) as a result of their low self effıcacy beliefs (He & Freeman, 2009; Huffman et al., 2013; Zeldin & Pajares, 2000) and adopted stereotypes associated with women, femininity and computer science mismatch between them (Cheryan, Plaut, Davies, & Steele, 2009). This study aims to determine the boys' and the girls' opinions and conceptualizations about coding concept and computers. The second goal is to assess attitudinal and behavioral patterns of boys and girls due to gender stereotypes, which affect their game experience and performance while interacting with the code learning game “Code Combat.”
