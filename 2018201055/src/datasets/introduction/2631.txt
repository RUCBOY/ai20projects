Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are essentially of multi-channel time series. A central problem in the EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is to extract discriminative features from the time series as much as possible so as to accurately decode mental activities [16], [13].
The decoding performance basically depends on how appropriate features are extracted and employed. For this purpose, a large number of modern machine learning approaches are introduced or developed [5], [21], [33], [48]. Among these approaches, spatial filtering, represented by common spatial patterns (CSP) [7], [18], is a commonly used technique for extracting discriminative features. The CSP technique spatially combines multi-channel EEG signals to form a few discriminative time series based on the neurophysiological effect of event-related desynchronization and synchronization (ERD/ERS) modulation of μ- and β-rhythms [28]. It has been widely and successfully used in the BCI community [9], [23]. Due to the usefulness of CSP, many invariants have been developed in literature. Some well-known examples can be listed as regularized CSP (RCSP) [22], common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSP) [20], local temporal CSP (LTCSP) [42], sparse CSP (SCSP) [3], stationary CSP (sCSP) [31], Kullback-Leibler-based discriminant CSP (KLCSP) [4], [30], L1-norm-based CSP [40] and comprehensive CSP (cCSP) for semisupervised learning [41]. The recently developed methods include probabilistic CSP [44], separable common spatio-spectral patterns [1], regularized sensor covariance matrices [29], and deep learning based decoding [32].
Although the CSP-based methods demonstrate good performance, they utilize only the amplitude information of EEG signals via the spatial filtering technique. The phase information of the multi-channel EEG series, on the other hand, plays an important role in characterizing brain activities. Neurophysiological studies reveal that phase synchronization underlies signal communication between widely distributed brain areas [34], [38], [17]. It is expected that the phase synchronization is specifically related with mental task, and thus expresses discriminative information. If incorporating this information into the CSP framework (as a standard choice of spatial filtering method), there may still has room to enhance the classification performance.
The conveniently used measures to qualify the phase synchronization include spectral coherence (SC) [2], phase locking value (PLV) [19], imaginary part of complex coherency (ImC) [25], phase lag index (PLI) [36], and weighted phase lag index (WPLI) [39]. However, as analyzed later in this paper, these measures have some limitations in discovering the intrinsic phase synchronization.
In this paper, we consider enhancing the classification performance of CSP by making explicit use of the information of phase synchronization. Specifically, we extract discriminative features based on the intrinsic phase synchronization and then incorporate them into CSP. The intrinsic phase synchronization is qualified by our method rank-weighted phase lag index (rWPLI) [45]. By integrating the collective advantages of all the above measures of phase synchronization, rWPLI is defined to detect the intrinsic neural relationship. We combine the features of rWPLI and CSP by three ways, i.e., serial feature combination, parallel feature combination, and dimensionality reduction. Finally, the combined features are fed into the classifiers of Fisher linear discriminant analysis (LDA) [12] and support vector machine (SVM). It is worthwhile to underline three important properties of the propose framework as follows. (a) The rWPLI, which aims to detect the intrinsic phase synchronization, is introduced to produce discriminative features. (b) With the three ways of feature combinations, we obtain the features which address both amplitude and phase information. (c) The framework is computationally straightforward.
We point it out that, in the BCI domain, the phase synchronization features have been studied. Specifically, in [15] and [43], the features derived from phase synchronization were investigated for classification. However, different from our paper, they used PLV to qualify the phase synchronization. In the experiments of this paper, the performances of using PLV and rWPLI are compared. Besides, our method is based on the classical and effective CSP technique whereas they used nonlinear regression coefficients or power spectral densities. Other methods involving the phase quantity for classification in BCI are to adopt the analytic expression (i.e., complex value form) of EEG signals [37], [11], [27], where the phase is served as an element of EEG expression. Clearly, the phase synchronization was not explicitly used.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The methods are described in Section 2, including the conventional CSP approach, the measure of phase synchronization, the extraction of combined features, and classification. In Section 3, experimental results of various methods on three EEG data sets are reported. Finally, the conclusion of this paper is drawn in Section 4.
