The performance of scaled semiconductor devices relies on the carrier transport properties of new device structures such as FinFETs [1], tri-gate FETs [2], and nanowire gate-all-around structures [3] and new channel materials such as Ge, III–V compound semiconductors [4], and 2D materials. Numerical simulations of semiconductor devices play an important role in the analysis and design of semiconductor devices having three-dimensional structures with new channel materials. Parallel computers having a many-core architecture are effective in realizing large-scale device simulations. This requires the development of parallel computing algorithms suitable for many-core architectures for semiconductor device simulations. A number of authors have focused on parallelization algorithms for semiconductor device simulation using the monotone iterative method for the parallelization of the multidimensional Poisson equation [5] and the Schur complement technique and the additive Schwarz method for the parallelization of linear systems arising in the classical drift–diffusion method [6], [7]. Previous studies have focused on the Flat-MPI parallelization, however the study of hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization is still not enough. The number of domains of domain decomposition methods (DDMs) has strong correlation with the number of MPI processes. In general, the parallel efficiency decreases as the number of MPI processes increases [8]. Hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization can suppress the number of MPI processes, which results in the better parallel efficiency. Therefore, the hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization is more suitable for supercomputers with a multi-core or many-core architecture. The inclusion of quantum confinement effects is another important issue. The quantum-corrected drift–diffusion (QCDD) model based on the density-gradient (DG) approach [9] is extensively used. For robust and highly efficient simulation, many efficient numerical techniques have been proposed [10], [11], [12].
This paper presents parallel domain decomposition methods for a QCDD model for MOSFET devices, which is described by a system of partial differential equations. To solve the set of nonlinear equations, we apply Gummel’s decoupled method [13]. A restricted additive Schwarz (RAS) method, which is a parallel DDM, has been studied for a single partial differential equation [8], [14]. An extension of the RAS method to a system of partial differential equations is not unique. For internode parallelization, two extensions of the RAS method are newly developed for the QCDD model with Gummel’s decoupled method. For intranode parallelization, we combine a splitting-up operator method [15] with the conjugate gradient (CG) and BiCGSTAB procedures [16]. The major contribution of this paper is the introduction and proposition of hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelization algorithms by the internode and intranode parallelization methods into the field of semiconductor device simulation. The parallel computation results for a three-dimensional Si bulk n-MOSFET on multi-core and many-core parallel computers are demonstrated.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a QCDD model of semiconductors. Intranode and internode parallelization methods are developed in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the parallel numerical results for a three-dimensional Si bulk n-MOSFET on a multi-core NEC SX-ACE supercomputer and many-core Cray XC40 supercomputer. Section 5 concludes this paper.
