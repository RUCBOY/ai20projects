A procedural model set is defined by a probabilistic program consisting of several parametric rules [1], [2]. Retrieving desired models from a procedural model set is a newly growing topic called inverse procedural modeling [3] or probabilistic program induction [4]. As a special case of probabilistic program induction, procedural model fitting (PMF) aims to search a procedural geometric model set for the model that is most similar to (i.e., best explains) a given set of data points. PMF has achieved remarkable progress in computer vision and computer graphics as it can extract rich structure information from the data [4], [5]. For example, PMF has achieved human-level performance in the one-shot pattern recognition task [4].
However, it is difficult to perform PMF as it has three challenging issues. The first issue is the creation of the probabilistic program, which is manually addressed in some methods [6], [7], [8], [9]. Several methods have also been proposed to automatically create the probabilistic program [4], [10], [11], [12]. Given the probabilistic program that defines the procedural model set, the second issue is the optimization problem to find the desired model from the model set. This can be addressed by Markov chain Monte Carlo [6], [7], [13], reinforcement learning [14], [15], sequential Monte Carlo [8], active-set [4], cuckoo search [16], [17], genetic algorithm [9], or neural parsing [18], [19].
Different from the aforementioned two issues that come from the model side, the third issue comes from the data side. That is, PMF needs a geometric similarity estimator to estimate the similarity between model and data to guide the optimization process. Most existing PMF methods pay major attention to address the model-side issues, while tackle the data-side issue using common estimators. Such a commonly used estimator is voxel difference, which is used in PMF methods [4], [6], [8], [9]. Another commonly used estimator is the Error from Data to Model (EDM), which is introduced in the well-known least squares method and is still widely used in modern computer science [20], [21]. Voxel difference and EDM are simple to understand and easy to implement. However, EDM is sensitive to outliers [22]. Voxel difference is also sensitive to imperfect data. In practice, data usually suffer from imperfection. That is, data are commonly contaminated by gross-outliers [23], pseudo-outliers [24], [25], noise, and missing data [26].
In this paper, we propose a novel geometric similarity estimator for PMF to robustly handle imperfect data. The proposed estimator is based on the Error from Model to Data (EMD), with our key insight that EMD is more reliable than EDM if the data are imperfect. As the counterpart of EDM, EMD is as simple as EDM. Although extensive investigations have been conducted in EDM [27], only a few works can be found in EMD. Note that, similar to EDM, using EMD only is insufficient to represent the similarity between a model and data [28]. A regularization term should be used to regularize EMD to ensure that only one model is most similar to the data. The ground-truth model cannot be distinguished from some trivial (null) models by the method proposed in [29], as it uses EMD without regularization [30]. The method proposed in [31] also uses EMD but requires the model to be within a narrow crust, which limits the application of EMD. In contrast, the proposed estimator has very few requirements for the model using a novel regularization approach.
Given the similarity estimator, we use the cuckoo search algorithm [16] to perform optimization for PMF in this paper. With few parameter to tune, the cuckoo search algorithm is a recently popular random optimization algorithm. In general, the optimization algorithm needs to accurately estimate the similarity, which is time-consuming. Observing that the dissimilarity can be determined by sampling only one point from the model, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine model dividing strategy to early reject dissimilar models to accelerate the optimization process.
The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) A novel geometric similarity estimator is proposed to strictly and robustly estimate the similarity between a complex geometric model and an imperfect data point set; (2) A novel early rejection strategy is proposed to accelerate the cuckoo search based PMF; (3) Several robust PMF applications are explored to fit cylinders, characters, and buildings.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review the related work. In Section 3, we give the preliminary knowledge for PMF. We then present our similarity estimator, our early rejection strategy, and the experiments in Sections 4–6, respectively. We finally conclude the paper in Section 7.
