Currently, CMOS is the dominant technology in digital field, however, new emerging technologies can be used to improve the performance of it [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Many studies to find new substitutes of CMOS circuits have been done. Quantum dot cellular automata (QCA) is one of the emerging nanotechnologies that has many benefits as compared to CMOS technology. It is faster, has denser circuit arrays and consumes low-power [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. QCA nanotechnology uses the interaction of bi-stable cells which are include four quantum-dots and two excess electrons [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. It uses positions of electrons to transfer binary information which are determined by Coulomb interaction [18], [19], [20], [21].
One of the most significant subjects in designing any digital system is memory designing that has been attracted high attention [22], [23]. A random access memory (RAM) as one of the important type of memories is designed to store and retrieve the information from any of its internal locations where the needed time for transmitting of information is always same [24], [25]. In QCA, there are two general structures for designing memory cell, line-based, and loop-based [26]. The loop-based RAM cell does not use extra clock zones and it constitutes a pioneering method of designing well-optimized [27], [28], [29]. However, any optimization in the number of cells, delay and efficiency in a scalability way of RAM cell is valuable.
The main aim of this paper is to design the layout of a RAM cell based on the loop structure based on QCA nanotechnology. The proposed loop-based RAM cell is made up of a D-latch as the basic component. This approach provides many advantages, including single-layer implementation, read/write latency improvement and number of cells reduction. In addition, the 1 × 4 RAM has been designed and simulated to investigate the scalability of the offered RAM cell. The major contributions of this work can be summarized in the following points:

•Proposing a design of loop-based RAM according to the new D-latch;•Analyzing area consumption, number of cells, and speed of proposed RAM and existing techniques;•Verifying and proving the validity of the proposed design using QCADesigner tool.
Section 2 gives a very brief review of QCA-based RAM cell layouts. Proposed D-latch-based RAM architecture based on QCA is described in Section 3. QCA layout and the implementation results of the proposed architecture utilizing QCAdesigner are illustrated in Section 4. Also, comparison with other RAM cells is presented in this section. Finally, the conclusion and future work are discussed in Section 5.
