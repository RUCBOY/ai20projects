Medical malpractice lawsuits have gradually increased in recent years and are often handled by professional lawyers. The quality control of medical practice negligence has been researched by health care institutions, such as the California Medical Association,1 Harvard University,2,3 and Stanford University, among others. Forensic science contributes fewer medical malpractice cases than other areas of medicine. Whether it is the health care system or the insurance industry, both are stakeholders in medical malpractice. Even if problems are investigated objectively, it is difficult to use them to prove malpractice. In 1988, Warren4 published a book review on how to avoid or deal with malpractice in forensic science. Later, between 1991 and 2012, Brennan,5 Hyams,6 Matthews,7 and Mehlman8 published guidelines on how to deal with the progression of litigation and medical practice. Only Ferrara,9 however, studied medical malpractice identification from the perspective of a forensic scientist, who would be more objective as a third party. To explore the research trends and hotspots of forensic science malpractice, we employed bibliometrics and a graph theory to study and review documents retrieved from the Web of Science.(WoS)
Introduced by van Eck and Waltman,10 VOSviewer (Center for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands), an open-source software, can be employed to display maps based on any two-dimensional metric. Gephi (https://gephi.org), which was developed by Bastian et al., is another open-source computer program that can be used to construct graph-based maps.11 Gephi can deal with a more than 20,000-nodes network and take advantage of multi-core processors. It has been claimed that Gephi's ForceAtlas2 has better measured quality, performance, and speed.12 Thus, using the abovementioned tools, we aimed to determine the trends in forensic science malpractice studies over the past approximately four and a half decades.
