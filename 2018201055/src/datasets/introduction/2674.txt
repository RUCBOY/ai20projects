In the last decades, the international game development industry has grown startlingly, becoming an important worldwide industry [1]. Researchers in education have seen this growth with great interest [2], since games have the power to engage players in an active learning process through interactive activities such as challenges and goals [3], [4]. Therefore, this category of games has demonstrated a significant increase in student engagement and motivation for science [5], [6], [7]; enabling players to enhance their abilities and build knowledge as they continue to play [8], [4]. This sort of game is named Serious Games in the literature [9], [10], [11].
The first definition of Serious Games (SGs) was created by Clark C. Abt [9], where the author emphasizes that the content of SGs should explicitly aim for educational purposes (regarding any area of knowledge), rather than pure entertainment. The term ‘serious game’ as it refers to digital games was minted by Ben Sawyer where the author discussed the potential of using digital games for public policy [10]. The addition of pedagogy aspects (such as activities for education, instruction, or imparting knowledge) suggests that SGs have more than just story, art, and software, which makes this type of game serious [11]. Serious Games can be summarized as the experimental and emotional freedom of active play, but with the seriousness of thinking and problems that require it [9]. Besides the educational purpose, SGs have been developed as data collection instruments, as can be seen in “Foldit”[12] which is a game with great potential for teaching protein structure formation for students in biochemistry.
It is a challenge for many students to identify and understand biological phenomena at the molecular level [13], [14]. One of the central obstacles is the difficulty in understanding the representations of microscopic structures, mainly because they cannot see or manipulate these structures [15]. Additionally, educators report that students have great trouble in absorbing the concept of molecular interaction [16], [17]. The use of games could be helpful in the learning process. Furthermore, it is expected that students pique interest when the process of learning happens in interactive and entertaining manners; which is easily achieved through the use of games.
This study presents the conception, development, and evaluation of Proteingo: a serious game created to build a crowdsourced database of protein-protein interactions; the game may be used as a support tool in the process of learning molecular interactions that occur in proteins, especially for those students who are studying such concepts into classrooms. It is necessary to mention that in this work we consider only the non-covalent interactions that occur between protein chains. They are weaker than covalent bonds, but still, play a crucial role in protein conformations. Proteingo counts on a friendly interface that allows users to analyze an interaction by visualizing the atomic interactions of residues in separated chains of proteins. Four distinct non-covalent interactions are considered: hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction, ionic interaction and aromatic stacking interaction. We conducted an experiment during the X-meeting 2016 Congress in Brazil, where 27 users played the Proteingo game. These players were also submitted to a post-test questionnaire to evaluate their motivation and experience. Furthermore, the development of these users along the plays, together with their answers to the post-test questionnaire, give substantial evidence of user’s incidental learning of the chemical interactions through the Proteingo game. Still, the majority of its players recommends the use of the game into classrooms. This article is divided into the following structures. Section 2 presents the background to understand the main concepts in the current study. The adopted methodology is described in Section 3, and Section 4 reports and discusses the results out of the experiment. Section 5 concludes the article and the last section describes the limitations of the present study and suggests some future works.
