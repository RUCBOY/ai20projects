The widespread adoption of information technologies and social media by the academic community substantially changed scholarly communication. Nowadays, researchers and academics actively use not only general social networks as Twitter and Facebook, but also academic social sites as Mendeley, Researchgate, and Academia.edu. The development of information technologies has led to the emergence of digital footprints of scientific communication such as download rates, blog and microblog counts, readership counts, links to scholarly Web spaces and journal websites. These factors increased the visibility of scholarly communication and made it more open, transparent, and rapid. Earlier bibliometrics was forced to rely primarily on citation counts. Now it could change and enlarge available quantitative datasets, metrics, and tools by using new digital footprints of scientific communication. The advent of new data extracted from social media gave birth to the new research field in scientometrics, namely altmetrics [1].
A number of studies have focused on similarities and differences between traditional and altmetric scholarly data. Other works investigated demographic and gender characteristics of scholarly networks' users, the influence of social media on researchers' professional activities, use of the social Web by highly cited researchers, and so on (see, e.g., [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]). New communication technologies have enabled research on the impact of scientific research beyond traditional scholarly journals. Blog posts, tweets, articles and links from Wikipedia, citations from booksâ€”all this digital content became a rich source of data for various bibliometric studies [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. This has encouraged the creation of new indicators, metrics, and tools for different aspects of scholarly communication and research output [13], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. All this gave rise to the tectonic changes in scientometrics, which some researchers called the scientific revolution in scientometrics [20], [21].
Altmetric studies of academic social networks and social media have shown that they reflect different aspects of scientific impact [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. The comparison of these new information sources with traditional bibliometric databases Web of Science and Scopus demonstrated that Mendeley was one of the most promising sources of altmetrics [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Mendeley fixes the reading actions of profiled users. It has the best coverage of the research literature [35], [36] and a large user population. Several studies have revealed significant correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts [25], [37], [38], [39]. Costas et al. compared Web of Science citations and the Mendeley readership to identify the differences and similarities between the two distributions [40]. D'Angelo and Di Russo examine the existence of similarities between citation patterns and patterns of Mendeley readership counts [41]. The significant advantage of Mendeley reader counts is that readership statistics appear more quickly than citations. Data from several studies suggest that Mendeley reader counts may possibly predict future citations [32], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47]. However, the adoption of new data and sources provides not only new insights into scholarly communication but also new pressing problems for scientometrics (see, e.g., [41], [48], [49], [50]).
For scientometrics to develop as a discipline, one should systematically use new data about scholarly communication, brought about by the advancement of social media and social network services. To date one needs to gain a general understanding of the differences and similarities between statistical distributions of Web of Science and Mendeley. Therefore, we turn to a comparison of data on citation and readership retrieved from the two systems.
The primary aim of this paper is to provide a systematic comparison of two information systems: Web of Science and Mendeley. In order to compare the two information systems on a systematical basis, we need to understand the statistical regularities underlying our data. For this purpose, we turn to a comparison of statistical distributions, characterizing the totality of scientific journals. It means that the unit of comparison is a sample of journals. We compare how one sample of journals is mapped into two different information systems. We would like to emphasize that the unit of comparison is a sample of journals and not its elements. The scientometric analysis of samples allows us to concentrate on the comparison of information systems instead of individual journals. Since we now have no ambition of developing a detailed theory of scholarly journals, obtaining the ranking order may indeed be the justified scientometric result.
In this paper, we refrain from direct tasks of evaluation and prediction of impact, prestige, or popularity of scholarly journals, and focus on studying statistic regularities. Without ranking of scholarly journals, scientometrics would be very different from the structure we know today. Here partial ordering is a mathematical way to give scholarly journals a structure. We stress that we do not use nor do we suggest the use of the concept of topological rank in evaluative scientometrics. Topological rank does not operationalize the influence or status of a scientific journal. The concept was created solely for comparison of the statistical laws that govern the citation distribution in Web of Science and the readership distribution in Mendeley.
The objective of the paper is to develop a ranking of biological journals based on a topological approach to the analysis of scientometric data. The paper also addresses the study of distributions of topological rank based on Web of Science and Mendeley. Our hypothesis is that scholars' attention in Web of Science is distributed similar to that of Mendeley.
