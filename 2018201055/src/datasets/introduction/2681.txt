Over the past decade, there has been an undeniable revolution in the way we interact with computers. Touchscreen devices exploded into the mainstream with the release of the Apple iPhone in 2007.1 A recent market survey indicates that there were 1.86 billion smartphone users worldwide by 2015, forecast to reach nearly 3 billion by 2019 (Statista, 2018b). Smartphones and tablets are now an integral part of life in the 21st century, in some cases becoming the primary means end users are interacting with computing devices in their daily lives.
Though designed for adults, mobile devices are commonly used by children who either own their own device or have access to one; for example, a 2017 Common Sense Media survey found that 98% of children in the United States ages 0 to 8 live in a home with at least one mobile device (Common Sense Media, 2017). In addition, mobile devices are now the most popular gaming device for children in the United States, ages 2–17 (Statista, 2018a). Children are using touchscreen devices in a variety of contexts, including in the home, in their classrooms, and out in the world. A significant body of work in child-computer interaction has established that children have unique needs, expectations, and abilities when it comes to technology interfaces (for a review, see Hourcade, 2007), given the changes in children's motor skills and cognitive capabilities as they grow and develop (Erhardt, 1994, Feder and Majnemer, 2007, Gesell et al., 1946, Piaget, 1983, Rosenbloom and Horton, 1971, Santrock, 2006, Thomas, 1980). For example, early work on children interacting with computers through a standard mouse and keyboard set-up found that drag-and-drop interactions were too difficult for most young children (Inkpen, 2001, Joiner et al., 1998), and that children have more difficulty acquiring targets in terms of both speed and accuracy than do adults (Hourcade et al., 2004).
Children's development also affects their interactions with touchscreen interfaces. Researchers in child-computer interaction have examined the limitations of current interfaces through empirical studies with children in order to recommend better design choices for children on these devices (Abdul Aziz et al., 2013; Arif and Sylla, 2013, Hamza and Salivia, 2015, Hiniker et al., 2016, Hiniker et al., 2015, Hourcade et al., 2008, Ibharim et al., 2013, McKnight and Cassidy, 2010, McKnight and Fitton, 2010, Nacher et al., 2015, Vatavu et al., 2015). Such studies often focus on a single variable or interaction task, which makes replication or general synthesis across the studies difficult. In contrast, our five-year project's past work on understanding how children's physical (motor) capabilities affect their interactions on touchscreens has contributed evidence-based design recommendations for this context, in a series of studies using similar methodologies and interaction tasks that enables a broader synthesis across contexts (Anthony et al., 2013, Anthony et al., 2012, Anthony et al., 2014, Brewer et al., 2013, Rust et al., 2014, Woodward et al., 2017, Woodward et al., 2016).
In this paper, we synthesize and report the cumulative results of this five-year project to explore the space of children's touchscreen interactions from an interaction efficacy perspective (Anthony et al., 2013a, Anthony et al., 2012, Anthony et al., 2014, Woodward et al., 2017, Woodward et al., 2016). This perspective emphasizes enabling children to experience successful interactions with touchscreen technology, in which their intended interaction is correctly recognized and carried out by the system. We make the assumption that successful interaction will improve children's ability to obtain the targeted benefits of apps developed with these recommendations in mind, for example, growth and development-based learning apps. We conducted empirical user studies with 60 adults and 116 children and collected over 55,000 touch events and 35,000 gestures to study the differences and similarities in their behaviors. As a result of these studies, we developed recommendations for other researchers and especially mobile application developers and interaction designers to use in their professional practice of designing for children. This paper contributes a cumulative look at the common themes, the differences between platforms and contexts, and the complete body of design recommendations we produced throughout this project. This paper will serve as a comprehensive reference for the design of future touchscreen interfaces for children with respect to physical (motor) adaptations as identified by the Mobile Touch and Gesture Interaction for Children (MTAGIC) project.
