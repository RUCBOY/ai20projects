Recent trends have focused on student-centred learning instead of a traditional teacher-centred approach, and on understanding how students acquire and process information.1 Since each student has a distinctive way of learning, understanding their weaknesses and strengths in this respect will help teachers devise appropriate teaching techniques. Over time, medical knowledge has undergone a series of changes leading to revisions in the curriculum and putting pressure on educators to adapt their instructional strategies to better suit their students' learning styles (LSs). Therefore, identifying medical students' preferred LSs is important, as this can help teachers develop pedagogical strategies that can lead to better outcomes. It can also help the faculty determine a variety of ways in which information can be disseminated among students.2 There are a variety of LS models, the most common ones being the Kolb model3 (experiential learning theory); the Honey and Mumford model4 (a modified version of Kolb's experiential model); and Fleming's VAK/VARK model4 (categorizing individuals into visual, auditory, read/write and kinaesthetic learner categories). All LSs are equally important, and knowing them allows teachers to choose from a wide array of instructional strategies.
Kolb defines learning as “the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience”.4 He describes learning as a cycle with four stages: concrete experience; observation and reflection; abstract concept formulation; and lastly, active experimentation.4 Each LS is a unique way of obtaining information and is influenced by the individual's background and altered by his/her acquired knowledge and expectations in a particular situation.4, 5 Kolb's experiential learning theory outlines two linked approaches to gaining understanding: concrete experience and abstract conceptualization on the one hand and reflective observation and active experimentation (associated with transforming experience) on the other.4, 5 To ensure effective learning, individuals try to practice all four methods. LS theory suggests that each individual learns in a unique and characteristic manner, because of certain patterns of behaviour. However, since this process is circular in nature, it can evolve from one LS to the next with the passage of time. Nevertheless, it tends to reinforce an individual's strong points and the resilience of their experience-grasping and experience-transforming techniques. Subsequent LSs are a mixture of a person's favoured styles.
The four LSs are Diverger, Converger, Assimilator, and Accommodator.6 These four LSs are defined according to the notion, put forward by Kolb, that learning preferences pertain to two continuums – active experimentation-reflective observation and abstract conceptualization-concrete experience. Convergers, who prefer active experimentation-abstract conceptualization, use the application of thought and deductive reasoning to solve problems.5 Assimilators, who prefer reflective observation-abstract conceptualization, are highly capable of generating theoretical models via inductive reasoning: they outperform the users of the other three LSs when it comes to investigating and organizing wide-ranging material into a manageable format.5 Accommodators, who prefer active experimentation-concrete experience, are more open to interacting with others and performing ‘hands-on’ work; furthermore, they respond well to on-the-spot situations and react to challenges spontaneously, instead of using logical analysis.5 Finally, the Divergers, who prefer reflective observation-concrete experience, tend to use their imagination to solve problems. They are excellent at developing concepts, and can offer keen insights from diverse perspectives.5
These LSs are influenced by five patterns of behaviour – culture, personality type, educational specialization, career choice, current job and tasks.7 Kolb's LS inventory (LSI) is a widely used instrument that is employed by medical students and experts to postulate the LSs of different individuals.4, 5, 6 Studies show that students with specific LSs prefer specific subject areas, and that this may influence their preference for specific teaching methods.7, 8 In a study involving public health students, Piane et al. showed that LS can predict test scores; thus, Assimilators got considerably higher theoretical exam scores and course grades than users of the other three LSs.9 Many studies have looked into student success and satisfaction with traditional training and student-centred learning methods such as PBL. However, there are very few studies that have assessed health care students' satisfaction with educational activities and their academic achievements in relation to their LSs.9
The LS technique is an emerging, though greatly underutilized, approach that is and can improve classroom academics if properly identified. The purpose of this study was to identify the different learning styles employed by health science university students at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Jeddah, and to examine the relationship between LS and student satisfaction with educational activities at KSAU-HS.
