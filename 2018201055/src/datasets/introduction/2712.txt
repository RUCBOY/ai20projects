Innovation relies on access to knowledge. Thus, knowledge flow patterns influence innovation and hence productivity and economic growth. As a result, factors that influence knowledge flow patterns are important to understand. One such factor is the immigration of foreign-trained knowledge workers. In particular, foreign-trained workers may have different types of peer networks that influence how their knowledge travels across time and space. An extensive empirical literature documents that knowledge flows are geographically localized (Jaffe et al., 1993, Thompson and Fox-Kean, 2005) and that this is likely because knowledge flow patterns are influenced by intricate networks of peers who are often co-located (Agrawal et al., 2006, Waldinger, 2010). Thus, it is plausible that if foreign-trained scientists displace domestically-trained scientists, then they could cause overall harm to US science by generating fewer localized spillovers because foreign-trained scientists’ relationships and thus knowledge flows are more internationally-oriented. This could occur even if foreign-trained scientists are equally or more productive than the domestically-trained scientists they displace. We examine the possibility of differential knowledge flows here.
In recent decades, US science has become increasingly internationalized, with rapid growth in the number of foreign-born scientists and engineers (Stephan, 2012). Between 2003 and 2013, the number of immigrant scientists increased from 0.7 million to 1.1 million (Lan et al., 2015). In the physical sciences, the number of immigrant scientists increased by 17,000 while the number of US-born scientists actually decreased by 13,000 (Table 1). With a downward-sloping demand curve for scientists and an upward sloping supply curve for US-born scientists, standard market analysis predicts that there will be displacement of US-born scientists (Borjas, 2007, Borjas and Doran, 2012).Table 1.

A central theme of the economics of immigration literature has been the measurement of wage and employment displacement effects (Borjas, 2005, Kerr and Kerr, 2011, Peri, 2012, National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2016). A large body of work has also explored the aggregate productivity effects of immigration (Kerr, 2008, Cooke and Kemeny, 2017). In the “canonical model” (see, e.g., Borjas, 2014), the existence of aggregate gains from immigration depend on the displacement of native workers. The relatively small aggregate gain implied by this model has led researchers to look for evidence of externalities, especially in the form of knowledge spillovers (Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle, 2010, Kerr and Lincoln, 2010, Peri, 2012, Peri et al., 2013, Kahn and MacGarvie, 2016). This has in turn led to an emphasis on peer networks that support knowledge exchange, work that connects to the large body of evidence that documents the importance of local knowledge spillovers (Freeman et al., 2015, Agrawal et al., 2015). But if local networks are critical to knowledge exchange within US science, an inflow of foreign-trained scientists that displaces domestically-trained workers could disrupt local knowledge networks if the foreign-trained scientists are less connected to US science than the domestically-trained scientists they displace. This raises an intriguing additional possibility of harm: US science suffers because foreign-trained scientists are less well-connected to US science than the domestically-trained they displace. Essentially, immigration of foreign-trained scientists could weaken the domestic knowledge networks that are critical to US scientific advancement.
We begin by developing a simple model of the market for scientists. A sufficient condition for the absence of foreign-trained scientist-induced harm to domestic science (as opposed to domestically-trained scientists) is that foreign-trained scientists generate as least the same level of localized spillovers to the US scientific community as the domestically-trained scientists they displace. In other words, there is no differential in the localized spillovers generated by foreign-trained versus domestically-trained scientists. Next, we test this condition by conducting a hypothetical experiment in which each foreign-trained scientist is assumed to fully displace an appropriately matched domestically-trained scientist. We then compare the level of citations by the US scientific community to publications by the now-US-residing foreign-trained scientist versus the matched (hypothetically displaced) US domestically-trained scientist.
Our model adapts the canonical model of immigration into a competitive labor market to allow for knowledge spillovers. Of course, in reality the economic effects of immigration are complex and occur through multiple channels in addition to the knowledge spillover channel. For example, allowing for differences in market power between domestically-trained and foreign-trained scientists will introduce wage effects that differ from the competitive model and thus affect the impact of displacement. As another example, domestically-trained and foreign-trained scientists may be drawing on different knowledge bases so that immigration can alter the size and diversity of the knowledge base available to the domestic economy. We thus stress that we are focusing only on a single channel – the way the immigration of foreign-trained scientists affects the connectivity of domestic knowledge networks and thereby the extent of knowledge spillovers within that network.
In the model, the combination of displacement and differential spillovers could harm US science. However, empirically, when we compare the relative citation patterns of domestically-trained and foreign-trained scientists, we find that although the US scientific community is much less likely to cite the matched foreign-trained scientists while they are in their original home country – the differential in spillovers is significant pre-immigration – their propensity to do so increases dramatically after the scientist immigrates to the US.1 In fact, the US scientific community is equally likely to cite a foreign-trained scientist and a domestically-trained scientist after the foreign-trained scientist has moved to the US. In the context of our model, this absence of differential spillovers is a sufficient condition for the absence of harm. It is important to note that these are aggregate results. We do observe lower spillovers to the US scientific community from foreign-trained scientists who move to universities with more co-nationals and from those who arrive from non-English speaking countries.
We further extend our analysis to focus on scientists in the right tail of the productivity distribution: “star scientists.” A growing literature within the economics of science reports evidence that stars generate a disproportionate level of knowledge externalities (Azoulay et al., 2010, Waldinger, 2010, Oettl, 2012). With this subsample of elite scientists, the foreign-trained scientist-generated spillover deficit disappears even more rapidly. In fact, soon after arriving, star foreign-trained scientists generate more localized spillovers than their domestically-trained peers on average.
We structure the remainder of the paper as follows. In the next section we develop a simple model of the market for scientific labor that provides a useful framework for examining the welfare implications of foreign-trained scientist mobility. The model allows for domestically-trained scientist displacement and differential spillovers from domestically-trained versus foreign-trained scientists. We describe our empirical strategy in Section 4 and our data and matching methodology in Section 5. We present our results in Section 6. We conclude in Section 7 with a discussion of the limitations of our findings.
