Regarding the increasing need of the human for energy, the need to optimize and improve efficiency of systems is felt; especially in the heat transfer sector in the industry increasing systems’ efficiency is very important. For this purpose, researchers are looking for ways to increase the heat transfer, so that increasing the efficiency of converters has been one of the major concerns of engineers and researchers [1], [2], [3], [4]. The fluids like water, oil, and ethylene glycol are widely used as cooling fluids, and are often very important in industrial units. Regarding extensive research on the heat transfer, no significant improvement has been made on the ability to transfer fluid heat. Therefore, there is an increasing need for fluids with better thermal transfer properties, especially a higher thermal conductivity coefficient than conventional fluids. In recent years, new methods have been used; one of these methods is the use of nanotechnology in thermal converters [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].
A new group of fluids are designed and developed by suspending metallic and non-metallic nanoparticles with dimensions less than 100 nm in a base fluid such as water, oil, ethylene glycol, and etc., as well as with high heat transfer potential, called nanofluid [15]. Also, the very small size of these particles has a significant effect on the solving of problems such as fluids’ corrosion, impurity, pressure drop and stability versus precipitation [16] and [17]. In nanofluids, by adding nanoparticles to the base fluid, thermo-physical properties change to the base fluid, also because these properties depend on the concentration of nanoparticles in the base fluid and temperature; it is possible to reach the highest possible degree by changing the nanoparticle concentration and temperature. Generally, nanofluids have high thermal conductivity, which is why the heat transfer rate is very high [18] and [19].
In the last decade, new advanced nanoparticles composed of various particles have been considered by researchers. These types of nanofluids, known as hybrid nanofluids, are generally derived from the combination of two different types of nanoparticles that are combined in the base fluid, which some of the studies conducted in this field are presented as follows.
Munkhbayar et al. [20] examined the effect of increasing the temperature, as well as the volume fraction of combined silver nanoparticles and multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the base fluid of water. Their study range was from 15 to 40 °C and up to 3% vol. of nanoparticles. The results of their experiments show that in this hybrid nanofluid, the heat transfer conductivity coefficient increased by 14.5% with the volume fraction of 3% at a temperature of 40 °C. In another laboratory research, Hemmat Esfe et al. examined the effects of increasing the temperature and concentration of titanium and copper oxide nanoparticles in a hybrid base fluid and a mixture of water and ethylene glycol at a temperature between 30 to 60 °C and a volume fraction of up to 2%. The results showed that, at 60 °C and volume fraction of 2%, the thermal conductivity coefficient increased by 41.5% [21].
Akhgar et al. [22] examined the thermal conductivity and stability of hybrid water – ethylene glycol nanofluids/titanium oxide – multi-walled carbon nanotubes under the influence of temperature and volume fraction variations. The experiments were performed in the volume fraction range of 0.05 to 1% and the temperature range of 20 to 50 °C. The results indicated that with increasing the temperature and concentration of the nanoparticles in the base fluid, the heat transfer coefficient of nanofluid increased so that at 50 °C and 1% volume fraction the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid compared to the base fluid increased by 38.7%. Bagheri and Ahmadi [23] examined the thermal conductivity coefficient of the combined zinc oxide - multi-walled carbon nanotube and water/ethylene glycol nanofluids. The operating temperature tested is in the range of 25 to 50 °C and the volume fraction is 0.0375 to 1.2 percent. The thermal conductivity of the nanofluid showed a 30% increase over the base fluid. Ranjbarzadeh et al. [24] used graphene oxide/water nanofluid in order to improve the heat transfer performance in a constant temperature heat converter. The study results show that the transfer coefficient of heat transfer in all Reynolds numbers using nanofluid has a significant improvement. In another experimental study to enhance the performance of a cool air-transfer heat transfer system they used graphene oxide/water nanofluid, and their results showed that the use of nanofluid improves the air-side heat transfer efficiency and they recommended the use of this nanofluid as a substitute for water [25]. In another study, Hemmat Esfe et al. [26] studied nanofluids containing single-walled carbon nanotubes in ethylene glycol base fluid. The concentration of nanoparticles used in this experiment is 0.02, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75%, respectively, in the range of 30 to 50 °C. The results obtained from the experiment indicate that with increasing temperature and volume fraction, the thermal conductivity coefficient of nanofluid is increasing. In the meantime, the effect of increasing the volume fraction on the increase in the thermal conductivity coefficient is higher so that it is the highest increase in the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid to the base fluid by 45% at 50 °C and the volume fraction of 0.75%. In another study, Keyvani et al. [27] examined the effect of cerium oxide nanoparticles on the thermal conductivity of ethylene glycol in the range of 25 to 50 °C and a volume fraction of 0.25 to 2.5 percent. As the nanoparticles increased, the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid was increasing so that it showed a 22% increase in the volume fraction of 2.5% and 50 °C to the base fluid. Nasajopour et al. [28] studied the effect of temperature and volume fraction changes on the thermal conductivity of the nanofluid containing zinc oxide nanoparticles and silver in the base water fluid. The operating temperature is tested at 25 to 50 °C and the concentration of nanoparticles dispersed in the fluid is 0.125 to 2 percent vol. The increase in temperature and volume fraction increased the relative thermal conductivity of the nanofluid and the main reason for this was the increase in the browning motion of particles in the base fluid with increasing temperature. Desired properties of nanoparticles have led nanofluid reducing the dimensions and size of the heat converters [29], improving the machining process [30], increasing the efficiency of solar systems [31], electronics [32], increasing the efficiency of the automotive cooling system [33] and reducing fuel consumption and cost savings in addition to overcoming the problems associated with the conversion and transfer of energy as an alternative fluid.
Above-mentioned references disclose that there are many works to study the thermophysical properties of nanofluids and their applications [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. Literature review also revealed that presenting experimental correlations and modeling the artificial neural networks (ANNs) might be suitable approaches for simulating the complex association between several factors in engineering issues [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51]. To save time and cost, repeated experiments can be replaced by experimental correlations and ANNs. In this study, for the first time, a new empirical correlation and a suitable ANN model was developed to forecast the thermal conductivity enhancement of the nano-antifreeze using experimental data. Nano-antifreeze has been made by suspending single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) in a mixture of water and ethylene glycol.
