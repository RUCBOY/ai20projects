Electroencephalogram (EEG) is an overall reflection of the electrophysiological activity of brain cells in the cerebral cortex and scalp, which contains a large amount of physiological and disease information [1]. The brain computer interface (BCI) based on EEG can be used as a communication system to replace the peripheral nerve and muscle normal output channels to realize the interaction between the brain and the outside world. BCI has been widely concerned by scholars and researchers in the world since it was proposed [[2], [3], [4]], such as sleep staging algorithm research based on single channel EEG signals [[5], [6], [7], [8]]and feature extraction of EEG signals for epileptic seizure detection [9,10]. The brain computer interface based on motor imagery is one of the most important BCI systems. Motor imagery (MI) refers to an object that only imagines the movement of the body without actual action, and is an idea activity that can be actively controlled by human [11]. Human imaginary movements or actual movements produce related EEG signals. The EEG signals generated during motor imaging have event-related synchronization (ERS) and event-related desynchronization (ERD) characteristics [12]. By analyzing MI-EEG signals, the imaginary's motion intention can be judged, and thereby achieving control of external devices. Such an implementation method provides a new way of communicating with the outside world. Therefore, the research of MI-EEG signal processing technology can accelerate people's exploration of brain cognition, brain therapy and brain application, and has been widely used in many fields such as medical rehabilitation, entertainment and smart home [[13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. The huge application prospects have pushed MI-BCI research into a period of rapid development, making it one of the most popular research areas.
The core component of the BCI system based on motor imagery contains two parts: feature extraction of EEG signals and feature classification of EEG signals. Commonly used feature extraction algorithms include wavelet transform (WT) [18,19] and common spatial pattern (CSP) [20]. These methods have been proven by many researchers to achieve good recognition results [[21], [22], [23]]. However, they either need to rely on a large amount of prior knowledge or are sensitive to noise. The complexity of the mechanism of MI-EEG signal generation reduces the flexibility of their application. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural networks (ANN) are often used for feature classification. Yukun Wen designed an algorithm based on LDA for Online Motor Imagery BCI systems [24]. In 2013, Kottaimalai et al. combined principal component analysis with artificial neural network to reduce and classify the five types of imaginary EEG signals of seven subjects, and obtained better recognition results [25]. Support vector machine (SVM) is widely used in biomedical field because of its good prediction accuracy and ability to process large amounts of data [26]. Although SVM has strong generalization ability and nonlinear mapping ability, the choice of kernel function and the selection of parameters lead to uncertainty in its performance. In recent years, deep learning with powerful ability to process nonlinear and high-dimensional data without requiring a large amount of prior knowledge has also been applied to the analysis of EEG signals. Cecotti et al. constructed a P300 recognition method based on CNN, and the BCI Competition public data set is used for classification experiments, and the recognition rate was up to 95.5 % [27]. Yang et al. combined CSP with CNN to effectively analyze multi-channel motion imaging data [28]. An et al. applied deep belief network (DBN) to build a powerful classifier for left and right hand motor imagery EEG feature extraction and recognition [29]. However, these models have the disadvantage of parameter redundancy, and they can easily break the information structure, resulting in the loss of correlation data.
This paper proposes a new model, KNN-based smooth auto-encoder, to achieve accurate recognition of motor imaging EEG signals. The model is used for efficient feature extraction of rough raw EEG data, and it has powerful classification capabilities. In this paper, the proposed method is used to experiment on two sets of data, and is compared with other related state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that k-SAE model can improve the recognition accuracy to a certain extent, and has strong robustness and good generalization ability.
The main contributions of this methods can be summarized as follows: (1) the proposed method uses the KNN algorithm [30] to find the nearest neighbor values of the input data, and then obtains a new transformed input through the weight function. Different from the traditional auto-encoder, which reconstructs the original input, the new input is reconstructed in k-SAE. Such a structure makes feature mapping vary smoothly on manifolds; (2) for the convolutional layer in the model, the Gaussian kernel function is used for convolution operation to remove noise and further smooth the data; (3) max-pooling and unpooling are used to realize dimensional reduction and recovery. These operations help to record feature values while preserving spatial location information, and maximize the integrity of data information to prevent loss of important information [31].
