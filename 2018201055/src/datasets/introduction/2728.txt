With the introduction and promotion of national macro-strategies such as the “Belt and Road”, research on high-end manufacturing systems and advanced intelligent mechanical equipment is receiving more and more attention. High-end equipment manufacturing industry is also taking on more and more in the development of national economy. The important role has become an important force driving China's industrial transformation and upgrading [1], [2], [3]. The development of high-end equipment and advanced technology is an urgent need for China's manufacturing industry to enhance its international competitiveness and enhance the right to speak international standards. A basic condition for high-end manufacturing is to have advanced machinery and equipment with high reliability, high integration, high intelligence and high precision [4], [5].
However, the rotating parts of bearings, gears, rotor systems, etc., which are the key components of mechanical equipment, are prone to failure in practical engineering applications. Especially for complex mechanical equipment, once a critical component fails, it may affect the entire production system. The operation, which interferes with normal production, causes a large number of economic and financial losses, and even causes serious casualties [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. The occurrence of these major accidents has made today's society increasingly strict requirements on the safety, reliability and high precision of mechanical equipment operation, and also highlights the necessity of monitoring and diagnosis of mechanical equipment status, and its important Economic significance and social significance [11], [12], [13]. Key technologies such as operational safety, reliability, and maintainability of major equipment and products in major national strategies such as the National Medium- and Long-Term Plan (2006–2020) and the Mechanical Engineering Discipline Development Strategy Report (2011–2020) has been listed as an important type of research direction.
Through long-term research and accumulation of a large number of researchers and engineering technicians in related fields, it is found that the diagnosis and evaluation of the state of mechanical equipment is an effective way to avoid the loss caused by mechanical equipment failure [14], [15], [16], [17]. Accurate and effective mechanical equipment fault diagnosis and health assessment methods bring various benefits to complex manufacturing systems, such as improving safety and reliability, controlling production accuracy, and reducing machine operating and maintenance costs [18]. Well-known companies and research institutions at home and abroad have also developed related products [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. The flourishing development of deep learning has attracted a large number of researchers to actively carry out theoretical research and application practice, and has achieved exciting results in many traditional research fields. For example, image segmentation, face recognition, scene semantic analysis, natural language processing, etc. [24], [25]. Deep neural networks demonstrate their superior ability to process complex data and predict complex systems. A large number of researchers in many fields such as medicine, finance, aerospace, and rail transit have used deep learning to overcome scientific research problems in interdisciplinary fields. One of them is the field of mechanical fault diagnosis [26], [27].
In this paper, deep learning can effectively train deep networks and perform multi-level feature representation of data. It can learn deep abstract features of data and have stronger and more complex data expression capabilities. Since the deep learning method was proposed, the neural network learning has set off another round of climax. Subsequent deep learning was widely used in image and speech recognition with significant success. Based on this, this paper studies the limitations of the existing fault diagnosis technology, combined with some methods in the field of machine learning, and studies several basic models in the deep learning implementation method, and applies it to the fault diagnosis of induction motors, from induction motors. The intrinsic learning data in the vibration data is beneficial to the classification characteristics, and the effective intelligent fault diagnosis is carried out, which greatly reduces human intervention. Using some depth models to realize the fault diagnosis algorithm of induction motor, there is no need to manually select features. The model itself selects the features internally during the training process, and extracts features that are useful for classification with some internal connections. This new intelligent fault diagnosis method is of great significance for the development of mechanical fault diagnosis. It aims to better realize the intelligentization of mechanical fault diagnosis, real-time monitoring and effective diagnosis of equipment operating state.
