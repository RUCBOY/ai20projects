Copper has gained significance over other non-ferrous metals, as a base material for fabrication of electrical connectors, lead frames, and micro-electronics devices, owing to its high electrical conductivity and low cost (Jung et al., 2015). Copper is also widely used for bolts, nuts, valves, and fittings due to its excellent ductility and malleability (Nnakwo, 2017). Copper is mostly alloyed with silicon and other elements such as tungsten, zinc, tin, magnesium, manganese and nickel to gain high strength and hardness without much reduction of its conductivity (Nnakwo, 2017; Nnakwo et al., 2017a, 2017b; 2019a, 2019b; Nnakwo and Nnuka, 2018; Garbacz-Klempka et al., 2018; Qing et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2003; Lei et al., 2013a, 2013b, 2017; Gholami et al., 2017; Qian et al., 2017; Suzuki et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2016; Li et al., 2009, 2017; Pan et al., 2007; Eungyeong et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2000). Silicon increases the fluidity and hardness of copper at the expense of ductility and electrical conductivity by inducing the precipitation of hard but brittle phases such as Cu3Si (ɳI), Cu15Si4 (ɛ), and Cu5Si (ɣ) when cooled slowly to ambient temperature (Pak et al., 2016; Mattern et al., 2007). Copper, when alloyed with silicon, can serve as electrode for lithium-ion battery (Polat et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Moon et al., 2006) and as a catalyst for the enhancement of nanosized and nanotube zinc oxide rods production (Cai et al., 2011). Copper-silicon alloys can also be used for the fabrication of musical equipment owing to their excellent damping property (Ketut et al., 2011).
Copper acquires high strength at the expense of ductility and hardness due to precipitation of β1-Ni3Si + α-Cu(Ni, Si), γ′-Ni3Al, β-Ni3Si, and δ-Ni2Si phases, after being doped with nickel and traces of other elements (aluminium, chromium, iron, magnesium, and tin) and subsequently aged (Qian et al., 2017; Suzuki et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2007; Li et al., 2009; Lei et al., 2013b; Eungyeong et al., 2011; Ho et al., 2000). Iron has been reported to cause enhancement of hardness and electrical conductivity of Cu–Si alloys containing nickel (Suzuki et al., 2006). Chromium and zirconium have been confirmed to induce microstructural refinement and precipitation of Cr3Si and Ni2SiZr intermetallic phases in nickel-doped Cu–Si alloys, leading to improvement of strength (Wang et al., 2016, 2018). Studies carried out by Li et al. (2017), and Wang et al. (2018) revealed that, with combined addition of chromium and zirconium to nickel-doped Cu–Si alloys, excellent hardness (122 HV-272 HV) and electrical conductivity (29.4 %IACS - 36 %IACS) are obtainable. It is pertinent to develop Cu–Si base alloys with improved ductility, hardness, and electrical conductivity, to enhance their applications in various engineering sectors, hence this research was conducted.
This study focused on examining the influence of trace additions of titanium on grain characteristics, conductivity, and mechanical properties of copper-silicon-titanium alloys subjected to normalizing heat treatment. The impacts of average grain size and morphology on the alloy's ductility, hardness, the strength, conductivity, and density were determined. The study also examined the significance of titanium content on the tested properties using RSOD and ANOVA. The experimental results were optimized to obtain the optimal alloy composition and statistical model equations generated for future applications.
