The American Heart Association recently stated the need for a coordinated plan for long-term rehabilitation to improve participation in daily activities among cardiac arrest (CA) survivors affected by physical, cognitive, and emotional problems after CA.1 Improving participation in physical activities can bring positive long-term health benefits including decreased mortality, chronic disease prevention, and improved quality of life.2 Cardiac rehabilitation is effective in increasing the steps per day and the proportion of participants categorized as physically active in people with heart disease.3 However, despite these positive effects, cardiac rehabilitation graduates have still shown long hours of sedentary behavior which is associated with increased triglycerides and body mass index.4 Interventions aimed at increasing activity levels at workstations or during television viewing for office workers or people with obesity have shown to be effective in reducing sitting time or increasing energy expenditure.5 However, none of the interventions were targeted specifically at people with cardiac problems, and these interventions are not applicable to those who are unemployed or do not have high television viewing time.
Considering the positive effects of physical activity and the negative effects of sedentary time, addressing participation at all levels of physical activity during post-CA rehabilitation would be beneficial for CA survivors’ health and well-being. To do so, it is imperative to understand the factors related to physical activity in CA survivors. For example, studies have shown that higher functional classification level and physical and cognitive function are positively associated with physical activity in people with heart failure.6, 7, 8 More than half of CA survivors experience fatigue that negatively impacts their performance and participation in daily activities.9, 10 The concept of fatigue has been described as including both an individual’s perceptions of fatigue and performance fatigability.11 Fatigability is the inability to sustain physical and mental activity due to fatigue, whereas perceptions of fatigue refers to the feeling of tiredness that individuals feel during physical and mental activities.12 It is possible that CA survivors are at risk of experiencing limited participation in physical activities due to both types of fatigue.9
The purpose of this study was to examine the association between participation in physical activities by CA survivors with fatigue and a range of both objective and subjective factors that were considered as modifiable by post-CA rehabilitation. In the study, physical activity is defined as “any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure” according to the World Health Organization (WHO),13 therefore, all activities are included except sedentary behavior. It was hypothesized that participation in physical activities would be positively associated with cognition, body movement, and ambulation ability and negatively associated with presence of depressive symptoms, pain, and fatigue in CA survivors with fatigue.14, 15
