Alzheimer's disease (AD) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] is a progressive nervous system degenerative disease. The typical clinical characteristics of AD include dysmnesia, aphasia, visuospatial impairment, executive dysfunction, etc. As life expectancy increases, AD is becoming a serious health problem in the elder. There are many hypotheses about the pathogeny of AD, like familial inheritance, physical disease, head trauma, etc. It is still an open problem of exploring the biomarkers [4] and making accurate diagnosis of AD.
In recent years, many machine learning methods have been proposed for the diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). For example, by integrating the classifiers on different local patch subsets, Liu et al. [2] obtained more accurate classification performance on AD data. Sarraf and Tofighi adopted the convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify AD patient from normal control (NC) [10]. In the early research work, people tended to focus on classification methods based on single-modal data [2], [3], [4], [5], such as structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) [5] and functional imaging (e.g., Positron Emission Tomography, PET) [3], and ignored the complementary information from other modalities. To alleviate this deficiency, Zhang and Shen [6] developed multi-modal fusion method combining different modalities, including MRI, PET, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), for AD diagnosis. Thung et al. proposed a deep learning model, which incorporates incomplete multi-modal AD data to improve the classification performance. Benefiting from utilizing the complementary information among different modalities, multi-modal based methods can achieve higher classification accuracy than single-modal based methods [11].
These classification methods used in AD classification are mainly based on the analysis of high dimensional feature, which may lead to the curse of dimensionality. Feature selection is an effective technique for dimensionality reduction by removing the irrelevant features. At present, a number of feature selection approaches have been applied into AD classification methods include multi-task feature selection (MTFS) [7], group lasso [12] and principal component analysis (PCA) [13]. In the multi-modal methods, these selected features of each modality are often directly combined to predict the class label [14]. However, most recent efforts made on feature selection methods ignore two important aspects: (1) the intrinsic correlation among different modalities, (2) the difference of sample significances.
For addressing these two problems, we proposed a novel multi-modal classification model, which is optimized in feature and sample levels simultaneously. For one AD patient or NC, it is reasonable to assume that the data of different modalities have some intrinsic correlation. The conventional multi-modal AD fusion method often integrates the different modalities linearly [6], [7], [11]. This approach may miss some latent important characteristics of different modalities. As we know, rank is the powerful global measure of matrix sparseness. Thus, in our proposed method, we exploit low-rank technique [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] to effectively capture the latent correlation of multi-modal AD data. In the aspect of estimating the sample significance, we adopt the self-paced learning (SPL) [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] to our method. As a cognitive driven model, SPL can dynamically evaluate the learning difficulty of each sample, and it gradually increases the training set by introducing more hard-learning samples. In AD classification problem, some patients may have many neurological diseases, it makes the diagnosis of AD or MCI difficult. Therefore, we apply the SPL into processing high-confidence samples, noise samples and outliers respectively in AD data. In the multi-modal fusion process, sample significance analysis is also helpful to describe and capture the relevance across different modalities. These important samples will make a large contribution in building the classifier decision boundary than those insignificance and noise samples. In this way, the influence of noise samples and outliers to the classification model can be suppressed.
In the AD classification problem, we need to handle several tasks include AD vs. MCI, AD vs. NC etc. In our work, we use MTFS to remove those irrelevant features to these tasks. After MTFS, the usual practice is to directly connect those different feature spaces into one single matrix and then train a classifier. In our work, we use the proposed novel MKL method to classify the multi-modal data, which is effective to reveal the latent correlation among different modalities and can offer a general framework for data fusion.
Overall, the proposed method mainly has the following contributions:
(1)The low-rank constraint is first employed to capture the intrinsic correlation across different modalities.(2)The self-paced learning is first adopted to estimate the sample significance of AD data. The SPL has been proven to be robust to noise samples and can speed up the objective function convergence.(3)The experimental results show that the proposed method achieves promising performance in AD classification.
