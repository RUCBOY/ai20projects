Let Σ be a finite alphabet of size σ≥2. A string S∈Σn is a sequence S=S[1]⋯S[n] of n symbols from Σ; the length n of S is denoted by |S|. For 1≤i≤j≤n, we denote S[i]⋯S[j] by S[i,j] and call the string S[i,j] a factor of S. A factor S[1,j] is a prefix of S and a factor S[i,n] is a suffix of S. A border of a string is a non-empty prefix of the string that is also a suffix of the string. In other words, the string S has a border of length ℓ, 1≤ℓ≤n, if and only if S[1,ℓ]=S[n−ℓ+1,n].
A string S is unbordered if it does not have any proper border, i.e., any border other than S itself. By L(S) we denote the maximum length of unbordered factors of S. Any unbordered factor of length L(S) is called a maximal unbordered factor of S.
An integer p>0 is a period of a string S∈Σn if S[i]=S[i+p] for 1≤i≤n−p. The shortest period of a string S is denoted per(S). Note that p is a period of S if and only if S has a border of length n−p, so S is unbordered if and only if per(S)=n. Moreover, per(S[i,j])≤per(S); applied to a maximal unbordered factor, this yields L(S)≤per(S).
Example 1 Assous and Pouzet [2]If S=1011001101, then per(S)=7 and L(S)=6. The maximal unbordered factors, S[1,6] and S[5,10], are underlined below.Download : Download high-res image (8KB)Download : Download full-size image
Unbordered factors were first studied by Ehrenfeucht and Silberger [3], with emphasis on the relationship between per(S) and L(S). The question when per(S)=L(S) received more attention in the literature [2], [4], [5], [6]. For strings S∈Σn, the equality holds if L(S)≤37n, as shown by Holub and Nowotka [5], or if per(S)≤12n, as can be seen quite easily; see e.g. [3]. Both these bounds are known to be optimal up to additive constant terms [5], and therefore one cannot hope to infer L(S) from per(S) in general.
Loptev, Kucherov, and Starikovskaya [7] proved that for a string S∈Σn chosen uniformly at random over an alphabet Σ of size σ≥2 the expected maximum length E[L(S)] of unbordered factors is at least n(1−ξ(σ)⋅σ−4)+O(1), where ξ(σ) converges to 2 as σ grows. When σ≥5 and n is sufficiently large, their bound implies E[L(S)]≥0.99n. Supported by experimental results, Loptev et al. [7] conjectured that E[L(S)]=n−O(1). In Section 2, we confirm this conjecture and prove that the tail of n−L(S) decays exponentially. Theorem 2Let S∈Σn be a uniformly random string over an alphabet Σ of size σ≥2. Then(a)E[L(S)]=n−O(σ−1);(b)for 0<δ<1, the probability of L(S)=n−O(logσ⁡δ−1) is at least 1−δ.
