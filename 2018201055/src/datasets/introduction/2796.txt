Security at critical infrastructures, such as communication, electrical power, rail, and fuel distribution networks, is a key concern and a challenging task for security agencies all over the world. These critical infrastructures play a vital role in modern society, which makes them to be the military targets in times of war. Besides, the threat of terrorism exacerbates the vulnerability of these infrastructures. For example, Colombia, India, Pakistan, Spain and Turkey have encountered terrorist attacks on electrical power networks, rail networks, and oil pipelines. Moreover, the components of these systems are always networked, where the connectivity as well as the topology structures of these networks have tremendous impact on their functionalities. There are always enormous public investments in each infrastructure system, thus, even a minor disruption caused randomly or deliberately, will inflict substantial economic losses [1]. The interrelationship among the components within a certain system and among different systems poses an even larger challenge on protecting these infrastructures.
In the past few years, many methods have been proposed to deal with the protection of infrastructure systems, such as Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA) [2] and game-theoretic approaches [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Due to the limitations of PRA that it requires static probabilities as inputs [10], the game-theoretic methods have been accumulating significant research interest. Nochenson and Heimann [11] propose an agent-based network security game to protect the computer networks. This game is a simultaneous-move and repeated game, where the utilities of the players are determined by the values of individual computers which are preassigned randomly in the simulation. Rao et al. [12] investigate the game in infrastructures consisting of a network of systems, where the costs of players are in sum-form, product-form and composite utility functions. Many other studies also investigate these interactive situations between the attacker and defender on defending critical infrastructures [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. However, most studies do not consider the connectivity of different components within a system and they only evaluate the payoffs of the players by summing up the valuations of individual targets. This evaluation is not reasonable in networked systems, because the importance of a target is not only determined by its monetary value, but is also affected by its neighbors. Li et al. [19] propose an attacker–defender game, which defines the payoffs and the strategies on the basis of the topology structure of the target network. This game is simultaneous-move and both players have complete information about the opponent. Keeping the protection resource allocation secret is common in real-world and is studied by many researches [20], [21].
However, in many real-world scenarios, strategies are not always selected in such a simultaneous manner. Oftentimes, the leader is able to commit to a strategy before the follower chooses its own strategy, which is a Stackelberg game. Stackelberg games are commonly used to model attacker–defender scenarios in security domains [1]. In many security problems, a motivated attacker can gather historical information about security measures by surveillance. Although the follower in a Stackelberg game is allowed to observe the leader’s strategy before making its own action, there is often an advantage for the leader over the simultaneous-move case. This first-mover advantage in a defender–attacker sequential games is discussed as a theorem in [22]. To illustrate the advantage of being the leader, consider the game with the payoff matrix as shown in Fig. 1, which is adapted from [23]. The only pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is that the leader chooses the strategy a which is a dominant strategy and thus the follower plays c, ensuring the leader a payoff of 2. However, when the leader commits to the strategy b, the follower’s best response is d and the leader obtains a higher payoff of 3. When the leader commits to a mixed strategy of playing a and b with equal probability, the follower’s best strategy is still d and the leader gets a even higher payoff of 4. Conitzer and Sandholm [23] firstly investigates this kind of Stackelberg game and studies how to compute optimal strategies to commit to in both normal-form and Bayesian form. Paruchuri et al. [24] study the Bayesian Stackelberg games in the domain of patrolling and propose an efficient algorithm DOBSS for finding the optimal strategy for the defender to commit to, which is at the heart of the ARMOR system that aims at protecting the Los Angeles International Airport. There are many other algorithms for these Bayesian Stackelberg games, such as ASAP [25] and ERASER [26]. Many applications based on these algorithms have been deployed in airports [27], ports [28], transportations [29] and many other infrastructures [26], [30], [31], [32], [33].Download : Download high-res image (66KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

In this paper, we will propose a Stackelberg game where the valuation of a target is evaluated in the whole network. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the cost model, strategies, payoffs of the game, and introduce the Stackelberg game with two typical defense and attack strategies. The solution method is shown in Section 3. The experimental results in scale-free networks are shown in Section 4. We also implement simulations in various networks in Section 5. Finally, we make a conclusion and introduce future work in Section 6.
