Tamil is one of the ancient Indian languages which is predominantly used in Southern India, Srilanka and Malaysia. The speciality of Tamil language is every sound pronounced has a syllable in Tamil. The economy of characters to represent a word is minimal in Tamil language. The smallest unit of Tamil script is syllable. These syllabic units of Tamil script has 12 vowels, 18 consonants and a special character (Ayudha Ezhuthu, ஃ). The combination of vowels and consonants (Table 1) make a total of 216 compound characters, thus a total of 247 characters. There are 5 borrowed consonants from Sanskrit, which when combined with vowels would yield another 60 compound characters so as to make a total of 307 characters. The complete Tamil character set (Table 2) can be represented by combinations of 156 distinct characters (Table 3). For example, கௌ (pronounced as kow) can be represented by combining ’,’க’,’ள’.Table 1. Combination of Vowels and Consonants in Tamil. First column has 12 vowels. Second column represents 18 consonants. Third column is the combination of a consonant with all the vowels resulting in the fourth column which are compound characters. Every consonant is combined with all the vowels to produce 216 compound characters.VowelsConsonantsConsonant + vowelsCompound Charactersஅக்க்+அகஆங்க்+ஆகாஇச்க்+இகிஈஞ்க்+ஈகீஉட்க்+உகுஊண்க்+ஊகூஎத்க்+எகெஏந்க்+ஏகேஐப்க்+ஐகைஒம்க்+ஒகொஓய்க்+ஓகோஔர்க்+ஔகௌல்வ்ழ்ள்ற்ன்Table 2.

Handwritten Character Recognition (HCR) is of two forms: online and offline. Online method converts the tip movements (strokes) of digital pen to a list of coordinates, whereas offline method uses characters as scanned images. The challenging part of handwritten character recognition is the variations in the writing patterns of individuals. Even the same person handwriting can vary at different times. Traditional machine learning approaches were used for an offline HCR for a long time. A typical machine learning way of handwritten character recognition would be pre-processing, segmenting, extracting the features and classifying. An offline HCR system is first trained with the set of characters (as scanned images) and later when a new character image is given as input, the system should be able to recognize it accurately. HCR has shown its usefulness in many applications such as sorting of mails in post offices, bank check reading, digitization of legacy documents and legal documents and handwritten document/form conversions.
Digitization of a handwritten document involves various operations such as conversion of color or grayscale image to binary image, extraction of the foreground text from background texture (if any), noise removal, separation of the individual lines, segmentation of words in each line, segmentation of the characters in every word and recognition of the isolated characters. However, this work involves only the isolated offline handwritten Tamil characters recognition using deep learning approach.
Other languages like Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hangul have several standard datasets and researchers have set benchmark for the same. Chinese have National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR) and Institute of Automation of Chinese Academy Sciences (CASIA) for promoting the research activities in Chinese character recognition with datasets such as CASIA-OLHWDB and CASIA-HWDB of 3755 classes. Arabic have datasets OIHADB and AHCD for 28 classes. Japanese have the Electrotechnical Laboratory (ETL) Character Database with the latest dataset ETL9B having 3036 classes. For Tamil, HPLabs, India have developed a dataset named ‘hpl-tamil-iso-char’ for 156 classes of Tamil characters which was used by very few. In (Vijayaraghavan and Sra, 2014), only 34 classes were used. In (Bhattacharya et al., 2007) though all the classes were used, they used a grouping method. Shanthi and Duraiswamy (2010) created their own dataset and was able to recognize only 34 classes. This work will set the benchmark for HTCR for all the 156 classes using deep learning methods. Chinese and Japanese languages have proven best results with the state of the art CNNs which was the motivation behind this work. The objective of our work is to set a benchmark for Tamil character dataset of HPLabs.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses about the related work in the literature. Section 3 presents the general convolutional neural network framework. Section 4 explains the proposed architecture for HTCR and steps involved in it. Section 5 describes the dataset used, experimental setup and training and testing procedures. Section 6 presents the result analysis and discussion. The last section gives the conclusion of the paper.
