The Fuzzy Relation Equations (FREs) are firstly introduced by Sanchez [3]. Then many researchers studied them viewpoints theory and applications [1]. FREs are increasing with respect to the variables. Due to the need to variables with a bipolar character in some applications [2], Freson et al. [2] introduced the system of bipolar max-min FREs and the linear optimization problem associated to it. The authors in [2] considered the ith equality constraint as single bipolar max-min equality in subsection 5.2 in [2] and presented a necessary and sufficient condition for the equation. They then decomposed the single bipolar FRE into two systems containing unipolar max-min FRE and FRI. They expressed that the necessary and sufficient conditions for existence of solution in the unipolar max-min systems are as bi≤maxj=1,...,naij+ or bi≤maxj=1,...,naij−. These conditions are only necessary conditions. Also, the authors in [2] expressed that the maximal elements of bipolar max-min FREs or set D are either g+ or belong to the set G={Supi=1,...,mgi|(∀i)(gi∈Gi−)}. This sentence is not correct. Then we revise the structure of set G such that it contains the maximal elements of bipolar max-min FREs or set D.
