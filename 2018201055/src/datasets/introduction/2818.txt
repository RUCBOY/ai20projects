Curve design is a fundamental problem with a long history in computer graphics and computer aided design. While it enters maturity in Euclidean space, the counterparts in non-Euclidean space, e.g. surface meshes, has not been thoroughly studied. The later has a wide range of applications, such as mesh segmentations [1], [2], [3], virtual surgery [4], [5], manufacturing [6], [7], [8], computational geometry on surfaces [9], [10], [11] and CAD software [12]. Users design curves on surface meshes by specifying several control points or an initial curve. A visually smooth curve lying on the surface is generated either to pass through all the input points (interpolatory curve) or to approximates the initial curve (fitting curve). Thus, such kind of curves should have properties as visually smooth and interpolatory (if any) under the manifold constraint, i.e. confining the curve on the mesh.
The difficulty of curve design on a surface mesh is to handle the manifold constraint. Existing methods on designing such curves can be roughly divided into three categories: parameterization-based methods [7], [13], smoothing-based methods [1], [2], [5] and projection-based methods [14], [15], [16]. Parameterization-based methods eliminate the constraint bymapping the 3D local surface patch to a 2D domain, e.g. a plane. The curve designed on the 2D domain is mapped back to the input surface. Although it is robust and efficient, the results are sensitive to the distortions of the mapping and it is usually difficult to handle surfaces with complicated topology. Smoothing-based methods start from a curve exactly on the surface, and slowly deform it while keeping it exactly on the surface, which are robust yet inefficient and incline to fall into local minimum. On the contrary, projection-based methods relax, or even ignore, the constraint first and project the smoothed 3D curve onto the mesh, which are efficient around smooth regions and have the chance to jump out from the local minimum, but the convergence and stability are problematic around bumpy regions.
In this paper, we mainly focus on designing smooth curves on surface meshes to interpolate a sequence of control points. The key idea is to adaptively relax the manifold constraint into a 2.5D shell space to combine the advantages of smoothing-based and projection-based methods. Specifically, our shell space constrained approach builds two layers of offset meshes enveloping the surface mesh, and tessellates the space in-between with tetrahedrons. Then a scalar field is constructed in the shell space imitating the behavior of distance field and the complicated manifold constraint is thus relaxed to a simpler distance constraint. We solve a global optimization via interior point method to constrain the curve inside the shell space. During the optimization, we adaptively enhance the distance constraint by gradually shrinking the thickness of the shell and increasing its weight till the constraint is nearly satisfied, which behaves more like project-based methods in the beginning for quick energy decreasing, and similar to smoothing-based method in the end for stability. The resulting curve is finally snapped to the surface through a surjective mapping from the shell space to the surface, which is efficient and gets rid of the instability issue coming from multiple closest points.
