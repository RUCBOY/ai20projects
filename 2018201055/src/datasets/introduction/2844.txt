Techniques for detecting human action [3], [4] have various applications, including public safety surveillance, home monitoring, human-computer interaction, and others. An action is an event or series of events that is carried out by one or more people with a single semantic meaning, such as smiling, walking, frying an egg, shaking hands, and square dancing. The action of a person or people can be imagined on a timeline: so it can be treated as an object in a spatiotemporal space [5], [6], [7]. Identifying important properties of such an action object is crucial to action detection. Based on the visibility of the action object in the spatiotemporal space, actions can be classified as complete or incomplete. A complete action can be observed completely in the spatiotemporal space, while an incomplete action cannot be completely observed. The properties of the action object that should be targeted for detection may differ between these categories.
For detecting a complete action, information about the shape of the complete action object should be captured. For instance, the kinetic energy [5], [6], which is an overall characteristic of the action, can be analyzed by tracking techniques to evaluate the robustness against occlusion, temporal alignment, and viewpoint variation [7]. Cho and Byun [8] considered connectivity of individual components of a particular action, and thus used the clique, which is the maximal totally connected sub-graph in the space-time graph, to detect the action node. Kwak et al. [9] carefully considered importance of levels, and used the hierarchical structure in directed graphs to detect actions. Invariant properties are robust, and view-invariant motion-pose descriptors of the anatomical plane have been developed [10].
Incomplete action detection requires the use of a property that enables uncertainty associated with the incomplete information to be processed. For instance, causality in the context is a useful property. Therefore, Li and Fu established the context-aware action-only causality model to predict activity patterns [11], and Vats et al. used the BK sub-triangle product to resolve uncertainties on the time line [12]. Statistics that ignore time labels are also useful. Accordingly, Li and Fu [13] used the histogram of oriented velocity and Ryoo [14] used the spatiotemporal integral histogram. Furthermore, Kong et al. proposed to capture the global temporal evolution along the time line as well as local consistency in smaller temporal segments [15]. In order to assess risk as soon as possible, both spatial and appearance-wise non-linear interaction between involved agents was modeled as a novel soft-attention Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) in [16]. In [17], abundant sequential context information was investigated to enrich the feature representation, including temporal orderings of action segments, label information, fully observed time series, and stacking features. Recently, prediction of human intents for surveillance purposes was studied in Xie et al. [18]. The basic ideas include that people’s trajectories in public spaces can be used to indirectly inference abnormal events, and that an agent-based Lagrangian Mechanics is used to derive a person’s trajectory.
Incomplete action detection can be categorized as early action detection or partial action detection. Early action detection detects actions as soon as possible, while partial action detection detects them using information that is available in only partial time spans.
Plenty of potential applications may be developed by using early action detection techniques [15], [16], [17], [18]. For outdoor and public areas, potential applications may include predicting progress or the winner of a sporting event, inferencing potential dangerous activities based on surveillance systems, and finding abnormal driving situations as soon as possible. For indoor events, possible applications may be health-care monitoring for elders, patients, or the handicapped. As for controlled or synthetic events, the smart meeting may be one potential application domain where it is important to reason out others’ thoughts based on early expression detection, quick speaker finding, and etc. Another possible application may be the smart room where the focus would be interaction between human beings and equipments, reasoning intentions of people, and providing services or help.
Hoai and Torre [1], [2] proposed monotonicity as a useful property in the detection of early actions. Specifically, monotonically increasing energy accumulated along the timeline should be observed throughout the action. To detect an action as soon as possible, much more energy must be accumulated in the early part of the action than in the remaining part [1], [2]; this demand is met by formulating the difference between the accumulated energies in correct detections and incorrect detections. The energy difference is formulated as an adaptive margin in the constraints of a structured output support vector machine(SOSVM) [19]. Hoai and Torre [1], [2] were the first in the field of computer vision to design a learning formulation for early event detection [1], [2]. However, they generated many constraints [1], [2]. Hence the cutting plane algorithm, which maintains a smaller subset of constraints in each iterative update is used along with the constraint reduction mechanism in the quadratic optimization process [1], [2], [19]. Furthermore, constraints with a large overlap along the timeline between the correct and the incorrect detections were not considered.
In this study, the number of constraints that were used by Hoai and Torre [1], [2] is reduced. Such a reduction is achieved by the following observation. In the method proposed by Hoai and Torre [1], [2], the required property of monotonicity is clearly encoded in the constraints. The encoding is based on the adaptive margin between the target early event and the non-target partial segment of the time series. The formulation of the constraints is rather compact in [1], [2]. However, if we carefully investigate the mathematical form of the adaptive margin, redundancy can be found among consecutive constraints. Mathematical explanations are provided to reduce the number of constraints so the cutting plane algorithm and the removal owing to overlapping can be omitted. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed approach using several data sets. To the best of our knowledge, such researches are rarely studied.
The rest of this is organized as follows. Section 2 elucidates the proposed approach for reducing the number of constraints, based on the SOSVM idea that was developed by Hoai and Torre [1], [2], providing detailed mathematical explanations. Section 3 presents the experimental results concerning correctness and efficiency of the proposed approach. Section 4 draws conclusions and makes recommendations for future work.
