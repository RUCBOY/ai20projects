Efforts directed towards improving in-hospital resuscitation performance, such as early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and standardized post-resuscitation care, have been modestly successful, raising in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) survival rates to an estimated 25% in 2017 [1]. Despite clear guidelines for high quality CPR [2, 3], one explanation for the marginal improvement may be health care provider's (HCP) poor adherence to evidence-based CPR performance in clinical practice, in addition to skill decay after initial training [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. This calls into question the effectiveness of the current CPR certification paradigm, and underpins the importance of innovations in CPR teaching. Numerous investigators have attempted to address this missed opportunity by exploring different educational approaches such as the use of CPR-sensing and feedback devices [9, 10], team debriefing programs [11, 12], high fidelity simulation trainings [13], and refresher training programs [14, 15, 16]; solutions that have had mixed institutional responses and buy-in.
A recent 2018 statement by the American Heart Association (AHA) highlighted the role of immersive technologies and gamified learning in advancing educational strategies in resuscitation by enhancing users' learning experience [17]. Wearable devices, that utilize augmented and virtual reality technology, have already shown promise as a useful training tool in many healthcare training studies with various applications in nasogastric tube placement [18], echocardiography [19], central line placement [20, 21], surgery [22, 23], and pathology [24]. This novel technology allows for high-fidelity simulation and experiential learning by means of holographic visualizations superimposed on what a user sees in the real world. The user's heightened perception of a more realistic scenario potentiates the learning experience, while allowing the user to practice in interactive high-risk situations. The objective of our study was to test the feasibility of an augmented reality (AR) platform for CPR training as a proof-of-concept that overlays an interactive holographic circulatory system next to the physical training manikin during CPR (Fig. 1). We tested the validity of this training system against CPR guidelines and evaluated participants' perception of this educational tool.Download : Download high-res image (854KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.
