Recent advances in micro/nano manufacturing of Ag/DLC nanocomposite films have been considered in various theoretical and experimental approaches in nanotechnology.
Marciano et al. [1] studied the antibacterial activity of DLC, Ag–DLC and silver colloidal solution by bacterial eradication tests with Escherichia coli (E. coli) at various incubation times. They demonstrated that the total compressive stress decreased extensively with the increase of silver nanoparticle layers in Ag–DLC.
Wu et al. [2] prepared Ag/DLC thin films by medium frequency unbalanced magnetron sputtering method. They found that the Ag concentration increased with the increasing Ar/CH4 ratios, accompanied by the increasing number and size of Ag crystalline.
Hybrid RF/MS PACVD (radio frequency/magnetron sputtering plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition) technique was applied by Bociaga et al. [3] to evaluate antimicrobial efficacy and biocompatibility of gradient a-C:H/Ti + Ag coatings concerning the surface physicochemical properties and chemical composition of the coating.
Baba et al. [4] prepared Ag/DLC thin films on austenitic type stainless steel SUS316L and silicon wafer substrates by a process combining reactive magnetron sputtering with plasma source ion implantation (PSII) to study its antibacterial activity using Staphylococcus aureus bacteria.
Constantinou et al. [5] used pulsed laser deposition (PLD) with an excimer laser technique to obtain different DLC:Ag films. They studied the morphological, topographical, crystallographic, compositional and mechanical/tribological characteristics of these films.
The electrical percolation threshold in Ag/DLC nanocomposite films was studied by Abdolghaderi et al. [6]. They used the RF-sputtering method to deposit Ag nanoparticle in the DLC matrix on glass and silicon substrates.
Detailed information about 3-D surface microtexture at the micro/nanoscale has important implications in the rational design and optimization in engineering applications and provides new opportunities for the investigation of precise topographical, spatial and chemical properties [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].
The numerical analysis according to stereometric parameters of the 3-D surface microtexture can be realized with a minimal set of criteria and surface parameters [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) enables the characterization of the nanoscale surface in different environments and creates 3-D topographic images to find out surface spatial complexity [17], [18], [19], [20]. The integration of AFM records with image processing techniques makes it possible to obtain information about a 3-D pattern of complex surfaces [21], [22], [23], [24], [25].
The aim of this study is to synthesise the Ag/DLC nanocomposite with different deposition time by RF-PECVD and to indicate the 3-D surface morphology using AFM and statistical parameters, in accordance with ISO 25178-2: 2012 [26].
