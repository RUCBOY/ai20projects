The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a collection of devices and applications through the online computer network to collect and exchange real-time medical data with one another for medical purposes [1], [2]. USA spends around 3 trillions USD ($) in healthcare which amounts approximate USD 10K per person. It could possibly grow up to USD 30 billion business in the next decade [3], [4]. It involves all the stakeholders such as patients, researchers, doctors and insurers through different computing devices (mostly mobile device). The main focus in IoMT are on: (a) Real-time patient monitoring; (b) Effects of medication tracking; (c) Self-administered rehabilitation; and (d) Medical supply and inventory tracking. Therefore, the IoMT incurs the benefits such as increased reliability through accessibility at any time, better treatment due to timely healthcare solutions and of course, saving time (personal visits to diagnostics clinic) & money [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].
EEG signals based brain-sensors are cranial wearable for recording brain activities. The IoMT devices of reading brainwaves, which are tracked and used for monitoring the mental health of a person and diagnostics for Neuro-psychological disorders [10], [11], [12]. Therefor, the hybridization of Internet of Medical Things and Brain Computer Interface (BCI) domains is not only a novel approach but also an unexplored area for research. However, we have found different literature which addresses different IoMT issues in [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]
The BCI is a multi-disciplinary domain of research comprised of neuroscience, digital signal processing and machine learning [20]. Interpretation of the brain rhythms is the prime focus in BCI. These rhythms are micro-electrical activities generated in our brain while we are performing some mental tasks. The most popular and cost effective non-invasive technique to record such brain rhythms is in the form of electroencephalogram signals, which is called electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG signal classification plays a significant role in the various BCI domains such as emotion recognition, motor-imagery classification and epileptic seizure detection [21]. Generally, five different types of EEG signals based rhythmic waveforms are there: (a) delta (0.5–4 Hz), (b) theta (4–7 Hz), (c) alpha (7–13 Hz), (d) beta (13–25 Hz) and (e) gamma (25–50 Hz).
Our work is in this paper aims at feature selection phase of the motor-imagery EEG signal classification. In a machine learning paradigm, the feature selection process deals with the trade-off between low computation time while maintaining a significant higher classification accuracy. In our past research [22], [23], [24], [25], multiple feature extraction techniques have been implemented and compared with one another. It is observed that the use of all features may not always ensure a high accuracy in turn increases the overall computation overhead. There are various types of popular feature selection methodologies. However, in [26], a naive adaptation in the form of a fuzzified version of Discernibility Matrix has been proposed and also compared its performance with the traditional Discernibility Matrix (DM) & Principal Components Analysis (PCA). In this paper, we propose a more mathematically backed Fuzzified version of the Discernibility Matrix (FDM) with different fuzzy and non-fuzzy dissimilarity measures and discuss their performances with other commonly used feature selection techniques.
This paper is prepared as follows. In Section 2, discuss the related research works. The Section 3 explains the theoretical concepts used feature extraction technique and other popular feature selection techniques. The Section 4 introduces the proposed Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix (FDM) based feature selection algorithm. The empirical results obtained from our experiments, and its analysis are presented in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.
