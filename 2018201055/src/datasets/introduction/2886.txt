Multicrystalline Si (mc-Si) is a dominant material in solar cell industry and better crystal quality has been contributing to improve solar cell performance [1]. Recently, production ratio of mc-Si tends to increase, because mc-Si is manufactured by the cost-effective directional solidification (DS) method. However, many dislocations to act as recombination centers are generated during the crystal growth which leads to lower solar cell efficiency than that of monocrystalline Si solar cells. To decrease the dislocation density, several improved mc-Si structures like high-performance (HP) mc-Si were invented and studied a lot [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. High density of random grain boundaries has been considered to release the thermal stress during the crystal growth which leads to lower dislocation density in HP mc-Si. Quasi-mono crystalline Si which is manufactured by DS method has also been focused on a starting material for solar cells. However, crystal growth of quasi-mono crystalline Si has several issues (i.e. dislocation generation at the seed joint, inhomogeneous nucleation at crucible walls to result in multicrystallization) [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. To solve these issues, we have originally developed quasi-mono crystalline Si growth method named as “seed manipulation for artificially controlled defect technique (SMART)” [17], [18], [19]. In SMART, defect distributions in a Si ingot can be artificially designed by arranging seeds with proper size and orientation. High density of defects is intentionally introduced in a tiny part of the ingot to act as a release site of the thermal stress. Therefore, in both structures of HP and SMART Si ingot, it is important to control generation and propagation of dislocation distribution during the crystal growth to achieve high quality material for solar cells. On the other hand, the mechanism of dislocation generation in mc-Si has not been fully understood, because the crystal structure in mc-Si is very complicated. According to our past report, dislocation generation in mc-Si strongly depends on the type of grain boundaries [17], [20], [21], [22]. However, the type of grain boundaries exists almost unlimited. Since it is impossible to investigate the whole grain boundaries by the conventional method, we consider to utilize the data science as a new approach to clarify the mechanism of dislocation generation, propagation and annihilation in mc-Si ingot. For this purpose, we consider a large quantity of photoluminescence (PL) images of as-sliced mc-Si wafers as a kind of big data to contain important information. Although there are various ways to measure dislocation regions (i.e. minority carrier lifetime mapping and etch-pit method using chemical solutions), PL imaging is able to measure a full 6-in. wafer in just few seconds, and image processing could detect dislocation regions more quickly, easily and comprehensively.
In this paper, we show the three-dimensional (3D) visualization of dislocation clusters in HP mc-Si ingot and analysis of the generation source of dislocation clusters to clarify the mechanism of the generation of dislocation clusters by approach of data science.
