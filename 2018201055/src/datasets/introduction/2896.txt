Safety Science is a multidisciplinary journal. It publishes research based on the physics and engineering of safety, related social, policy and organizational aspects, the assessment, management and communication of risks, the effectiveness of control and management techniques for safety, standardization, legislation, inspection, insurance, cost aspects, human behaviour, safety and the like. Its aim is to contribute to the field of science and technology of human and industrial safety. Safety Science started its journey in 1976 and now is celebrating its 40th anniversary. Today, the journal is very well known for its high-quality publications in the scientific community. The journal’s ample audience includes safety engineers and inspectors, industrial engineers, research scientists, industrial psychologists, ergonomists, safety and health practitioners and safety policy makers. According to the 2017 Journal Citation Reports of Thomson & Reuters, Safety Science had an impact factor of 2.246 and an eigenfactor score of 0.011030 with a total of 5969 citations. The journal was ranked in the 16th position out of 44 journals in the Web of Science category of Engineering, Industrial (EI). The journal also appears in the Web of Science category of Operations Research and Management Science (OR-MS) (Merigó and Yang, 2017) in the 22nd position out of 83 journals. According to the 5-year Impact Factor, Safety Science has an impact factor equal to 2.668, and it holds the 14th and 21st positions, respectively, in the EI and OR-MS categories.
In 2016, the journal completed four decades of publications. During this forty-year journey from 1976 to 2016, the journal published 2902 articles in total. This study aims to celebrate this anniversary by analysing the most significant trends that have occurred in the journal during this period through a general bibliometric analysis. This general bibliometric study analyses the productivity and influence of the journal and shows the leading topics, authors, institutions and countries. The data are compiled by using the Web of Science Core Collection database. To develop the mapping analysis of the bibliographic data, the paper uses the visualization of similarities (VOS) viewer software (Van Eck and Waltman, 2010). The work presents graphical representations of bibliographic couplings (Kessler, 1963), co-citations (Small, 1973), citations, co-authorships and co-occurrences of keywords (Martínez-López et al., 2018, Merigó et al., 2018).
Recently, Safety Science published several bibliometric studies on issues concerning safety research. For example, Li and Hale (2015) study leading trends among core safety journals. Later, Li and Hale (2016) develop output distributions and topic maps of journals connected to safety research. Van Nunen et al. (2017) present a bibliometric study of research on safety cultures. However, no work has yet addressed a general bibliometric overview of the journal.
Journals are used to celebrating their significant anniversaries by organizing some special activities, such as editorials (Barley, 2016, Shugan, 2006), reviews (Van Fleet et al., 2006), and special issues (Kozlowski et al., 2017). Many journals also have presented a bibliometric analysis of the publications of the journal to celebrate their anniversary. Table 1 presents some good examples of journals’ bibliometric analyses.Table 1.

Table 1 depicts that approximately thirty years ago, Heck and Bremser (1986) studied the bibliometric contributions of The Accounting Review to celebrate its 60-year anniversary. Weiss and Qiu (2008) provided a historical study of The Journal of Risk and Insurance to celebrate its 75th anniversary. Recently, journals have been eagerly showing their keen interest to celebrate their journey, contributions and presence by publishing bibliometric studies.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the bibliometric methods used in the study. Section 3 presents the results, including the publication and citation structures, and the leading authors, institutions and countries publishing in the journal. Section 4 develops a graphical visualization of the bibliographic data of Safety Science with the VOS viewer software. Section 5 summarizes the main findings and concludes the paper.
