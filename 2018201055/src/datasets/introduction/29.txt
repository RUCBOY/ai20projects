Ionizing radiations are general term for electromagnetic waves or nuclear particles, which are emitted from nuclear fission or decay from unstable atoms (i.e. radioactive elements). They carry certain amount of energy (more than 10 eV), and this is sufficient to ionize the molecules and to break the chemical bonds. Hence, exposure to high amount of ionizing radiations can cause sharp health problems such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and skin burns. Accordingly, in order to use radioactive materials, it is important to estimate and evaluate the amount of photons that penetrate the medium and to measure the photons intensity loss when pass through the medium [1]. For this reason, the protection from the ionizing radiation emitted from different radioactive materials which utilized usually in medical, industrial and technological applications is very important for human health. Radiation shielding materials defined as the materials that can reduce the photons intensity and consequently used to protect humans from direct and secondary radiations [2]. Anciently, these materials which used to block the radiation have been produced from lead. Lead and its compounds are frequently utilized in several kinds of applications epically in the medical fields including X-ray imaging, computerized tomography (CT), mammography and radiation therapy. Lead, however, is a toxin that can cause severe health problems and even death at high exposure. This fact, in addition to lead's low flexibility and heavy weight, make it slightly impractical. Consequently, non-lead alternatives need to be found to avoid the use of this toxin any further in different practical applications [3]. The free-lead protection materials are those materials that can block or absorb the photons and usually fabricated from attenuating heavy metals such as bismuth, barium, tungsten and antimony [4]. Generally, concretes, some types of alloys and glasses are utilized as shielding materials from high energy photons exposure because of their high attenuating ability [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]. It is important to note that there are several drawbacks of utilizing concretes and alloys as shielding materials, such as one can't see through these materials because they are not transparent to the visible light. Therefore, glasses are considered a good alternative to the traditional protection materials due to the transparency to the light and some other special chemical, mechanical, optical and physical features like high density and thus can effectively block the radiation, non-toxicity and ease of production [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. In order to determine the photon attenuation factors, many computer software are used and one of the most important software in this regard is the WinXcom [16]. However, this is a very useful software, but we can get only the mass attenuation coefficient values from this software. Recently, Şakar et al. [17] developed new software namely Phy-X/PSD which is totally free software and available online and can calculate different dosimetry and protection factors such as tenth value layer, effective conductivity, electron density, buildup factor, …etc at any desired energies. In the current investigation, we reported the gamma radiation shielding characteristics for lithium-zinc-tellurite glasses using Geant4 and Phy-X/PSD program. The linear attenuation coefficient, the transmission factor and other related parameters were evaluated. The effects of the energy and the TeO2 contents on the radiation shielding features for the selected glasses were discussed. The radiation shielding features of the chosen glass systems have also been compared among themselves and with the shielding features of different radiation shielding materials to establish that the chosen glasses have better radiation shielding efficiency. The composition of the selected glasses is tabulated in Table 1 [18].Table 1.
