Lorentz beam [1] is the approximate non-diffracting beam in physical [2], which can propagate long distance and the size and intensity of it is stable. Therefore, it can be used in many fields as the atmospheric laser communication, the implementation of the electromagnetic wave shells and bullets, energy transfer between the spacecraft and communications and high precision surface micro topography measurement and more. As a Lorentz beam modulated by Gaussian beam, Lorentz-Gaussian beam represents the beam excited by a single-mode diode laser [3,4]. Scientists have conducted extensive research about the ABCD paraxial optical system and the transmission characteristics of atmospheric turbulence, analyzed the focal shift characteristics of the lens aperture system and put forward the virtual source of Lorentz- Gaussian beam generated by rotating [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. In addition, some has proposed the super Lorentz-Gaussian beam [9]. For wider application, Spiral phase plate was adopted to regulate beam, which can obtain helico-lorentz-Gauss beam [10,11] and helico-conical Lorentz-Gauss beam [12,13]. Such beams can be used in optical micro-control and quantum information processing.
As the other special polarization form of axial symmetry vector field, azimuthally polarized vortex beam has attracted lots of attentions in recent years. on account of the singularity of polarization, azimuthally polarized vortex beam can present hollow focus [14,15], on the position of optical axis in focal plane, which would be suitable to trap particle [[16], [17], [18]], cold atoms [19,20], and as a de-excitation beam for super-resolution optical microscopy [[21], [22], [23], [24]]. In recent years, itâ€™s indicated that the incorporation of some approaches to manipulate the focal field distribution of azimuthally polarized vortex beams may provide a tremendous validity to light-induced magnetization [25,26]. In particular, the generation of needle-like probes with pure longtinal magnetization at a subwavelength scale is highly desired for ultrahigh density magnetic storage [27,28] as well as fabricating magnetic lattices for spin wave operation and atomic trapping [[29], [30], [31]]. Additionally, the applications of polarized vortex beam in quantum communication, weak magnetic sensor and other fields have been more and more popular. Simultaneously, the spin polarization beam can generate a hollow beam with the zero central light intensity and the dark area can be the narrowest, which attracts widely attention in super resolution microscopic imaging technology, nano processing and atom trapping. In recent years, domestic and overseas has provide very thorough research for the typical Gauss beam and Bessel-Gauss beam, resulting in almost non-diffracting beam by way of circular weld radiography of conical lens, holographic method, cavity method and others. Also, explicit instruments about the selection of optical beam parameters were presented [32]. However, there are few systematic studies on the focusing characteristics of azimuthally polarized Lorentz-Gaussian beam.
In this paper, we investigate relevant studies on the azimuthally polarized Lorentz-Gaussian beam, providing the expressions for the electric fields of azimuthally polarized Lorentz-Gaussian vortex beam, so as to analyze the focal discipline of azimuthally polarized Lorentz-Gaussian vortex beam. In accordance with vector diffraction theory, the analytical expression for calculating the three-dimensional electromagnetic fields combining azimuthal state of polarization and optical vortex is proposed. In addition, beam parameters including the topological charge m, eccentric parameter K and NA are illustrated to manipulate the energy flow pattern. In the meantime, the desired beam with specific parameters is fabricated experimentally with the aid of CGH in Fourier space.
