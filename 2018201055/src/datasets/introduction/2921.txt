There is an increasing demand for preclinical in-vivo imaging thanks to the development of animal models of human diseases such as transgenic mice. Visualized and quantified imaging of structures in small animals, however, imposes stringent requirements on the imaging system. Among many imaging modalities, small animal positron emission tomography (PET) studies are essential tools in development of new pharmaceuticals and therapies as well as for quantification of diverse biochemical and physiological processes in living organisms [1]. The PET image provides functional diagram of organs which can be interpreted along the other modalities providing anatomical data i.e. magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) [2].
The development of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs), and fast commercialization of the technology by many vendors that is mainly due to its simpler design compared with conventional photomultiplier tube (PMT) or Microchannel Plate PMT (MCP-PMT), has opened new avenues for PET system development even in developing countries [3]. Some of their favorable advantages over PMTs are lower bias supply, insensitivity to magnetic field, small footprint which has made new detector designs as well as simultaneous PET-MR practical. Simultaneous PET-MR imaging has been showed advantageous for reducing dose and improved soft tissue contrast that helps distinguishing different organs and functions [2], [4].
The above-mentioned potentials for small animal PET and SiPM technology along with the increasing demand for animal studies motivated us to develop a low-cost, modular, scalable, and compact/mobile PET scanner for small animal imaging. There have been many works on small animal PET with excellent resolution usually using sophisticated detector design and application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chips for the front-end [5], [6], [7], [8] readout.
Since the high cost of detectors is, to some extent, mitigated by a pool of SiPM vendors, in-house development of low-cost PET detector systems for research groups to explore new ideas is now more feasible [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Our strategy by introducing a full ring PET system, was to use simple detector design and widely accessible SiPM and FPGAs for the front-end and back-end readout and emphasize on in-house development challenges. The detector design is based on electronic channel reduction to both lower the cost and system complexity and data bandwidth, but any other detector design which can produce gamma interaction information locally, can be easily adapted to the proposed PET scanner. And lastly, the proposed PET system with separating SiPMs from heat generating electronics is to operate in room temperature despite the high sensitivity of SiPMs to temperature. Clearly, the best performance in SiPM-based detectors is achieved when a cooling system maintains the SiPM temperature in 0–10 °C range [14], [15]. In what follows, we outline the foundation of our low-cost PET system platform and detail the system description and provide the first phantom and animal imaging results.
