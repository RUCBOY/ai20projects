Many data in the real world, such as social networks [1], [2], [3], [4], chemical compounds [5], protein interaction networks [6], etc., can be commonly represented as a graph structure. As an important branch in the field of graph mining, graph classification is applied to numerous practical fields [7], [8], [9], [10]. However, since the traditional machine learning algorithm cannot directly process the graph structure data, it is necessary to vectorize such data.
In the past few decades, the graph kernel function is a popular method of vectorizing graph data [11]. The graph classification method based on the kernel uses the graph kernel function to obtain the similarity matrix between the graphs first [5], and then inputs the similarity matrix into the traditional classifier such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform task of the graph classification. There are two main problems of the graph classification methods based on kernel function. First, as the number of samples increases, the cost of storing and calculating the kernel matrix is high. The other is the lack of feature selection process. However, the low discriminative substructure of the graph set will lead to a decrease in classification accuracy, and when mapping the graph to a high-dimensional feature space, it may contain plenty of redundant features, which may also result in increased computational complexity and reduced classification accuracy.
Recently, deep learning approaches like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in many fields, such as image classification [12], object recognition [13], and natural language processing [14], [15], [16]. The traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) performs convolution operations on pixels on the image, while the graph structure lacks an ordered tensor representation. Therefore, the graph convolution network emerges, which is a deep learning method that can process graph-structured data [17], [18], [19]. In general, existing graph convolution networks fall into two categories: spectral convolution [20], [21], [22] and spatial convolution [23], [24], [25], [26]. Spectral convolution exploits the spectral filters using the graph laplacian to redefine the convolution in the Fourier domain [21]. By contrast, spatial convolution is directly convolved on the graph. It usually aggregates the characteristics of neighbor vertices to the central node [24]. However, most existing spatial methods only consider a single indicator to measure the significance of a vertex when selecting a central node sequence, which may lose some nodes that are important to the classification. For example, the PSCN proposed by Niepert et al. [25] used centrality measure, such as betweenness centrality or degree centrality, to map nodes into an ordered sequence to select important nodes, which failed to comprehensively measure the importance of nodes from multiple aspects. At the same time, most of the methods fail to make full use of the structural features and node features of the graph, which will be introduced in detail in related work. In addition, although literatures [27], [28] are aimed at image classification and pattern recognition, they use hypergraphs or tensors as tools to achieve local matching to solve classification problems, so it also has great inspiration for processing graph classification task.
In order to solve the issue of considering one-sidedness while choosing the central node and extracting characteristics in the above spatial methods, we put forward a novel spatial convolutional neural network (SCNN) for graph classification, which is based on structural characteristics of significant nodes. In this article, our contributions are as follows:
•While selecting the central node sequence, we put forward a comprehensive weighting method to determine the comprehensive weights of multiple evaluation indicators that measure the significance of the node. The selected evaluation index combines the global and local information of the node. And then the results obtained by multiplying the evaluation index value of the vertex and the corresponding comprehensive weight of each indicator are summed to obtain the significance of the node. Thereby the nodes in the graph can be sorted by the importance of the node.•For the unity of node characteristics input to the convolutional layer, it is proposed to choose multiple node features and simultaneously introduce the spectral characteristics of nodes from both local and global aspects of the graph, which can retain more structural information of graphs.•The channel concatenation layer is proposed so that the classification of the whole graph can be determined based on the category of neighborhood graphs.
The rest of the article is organized as follows. We introduce the related work on graph kernel and graph convolution network methods in Section 2. In Section 3, preliminary knowledge involved in this article is introduced. In Section 4, we introduce our novel spatial convolutional neural network for graph classification, including the selection of central node sequences, construction of neighborhood graphs, selection of node features, and architecture of spatial convolutional neural networks. Experimental results are given in Section 5. Finally, conclusion and future work are presented in Section 6.
