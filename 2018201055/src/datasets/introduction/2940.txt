Image composition is a classic technique that could composite an extracted region from candidate images into the target image. The aim is to obtain semantically valid composited results while keeping two regions consistent, especially for the boundary. Owing to the prominent effect, the technique has been widely used for image stitching [1,2], digital photomontage [3,4], and photo clip art [5].
Gradient-domain filters [[6], [7], [8]] are classic ways that could achieve composited results. However, these filters could not obtain realistic composited results in some special cases, especially when it is difficult to handle the boundary of composited images. In order to reduce the differences between target region and extracted region, a previous paper [9] proposed a multi-scale harmonization framework that could balance the features in different levels. However, when the extracted region and the target region are apparently different in the space of color, texture, and so on, the composited quality is evidently reduced. Thus, it is a challenge for us to improve the composition results.
Moreover, with the development of semantic techniques [[10], [11], [12], [13]], the requirement of composited results is also increased. Composition techniques not only need to keep the two regions consistent, but also need to make the composited results more semantically valid. For this problem, the semantic-based retrieval method [[14], [15], [16]] has been applied to other fields. However, there are obvious differences between candidate image retrieval and semantic-based retrieval. For the semantic-based retrieval method, we could keep the retrieval accuracy by studying enough instances. For candidate image retrieval, although we just need to retrieve some similar images from the target image, the prior knowledge is only the target image. Thus, the difficulty of retrieval is increased. Aiming at these problems, paper [17] retrieved the candidate images by using Euclidean distance of GIST descriptor. Meanwhile, paper [18] retrieved the candidate images by taking image entropy into consideration. However, after some groups of experiments, we found that the models could not maintain the quality of candidate image retrieval or some models are only targeted for some special categories. Thus, retrieving enough and semantically valid candidate images has also become a challenging problem. Moreover, consistent composited results also need to fulfill modern requirements. Aiming at the aforementioned problems, we proposed a framework that could achieve semantically valid and consistent multi-option composition. Our contributions are enumerated as follows:
(1) A sparse coding based candidate image selection model is used for retrieving sufficient and semantically valid candidate images.
(2) A multi-scale feature handling based model is used for achieving consistent and seamless composition.
