The bandgap of the AlXGa1-XN system covers from 3.42 eV to 6.04 eV [1], [2] as a function of Al content from zero to unity. AlGaN materials are useful for ultraviolet (UV) LEDs and laser diodes as a host material [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], visible LEDs as AlGaN barriers in the active region [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], artificial photosynthesizers as photoanodes [15], [16], [17], and electronic devices [18], [19], [20]. Metalorganic vapor-phase epitaxial (MOVPE) growth of AlGaN is unique. AlN growth rate has a linear dependence on the flow rate of trimethyl aluminum (TMAl) [21]. However, the AlGaN growth rate decreases with the TMAl flow rate under the constant flow of trimethyl gallium (TMGa) [21], [22], [23]. That decline in AlGaN growth rate indicates that additional polymerizations among Al- and Ga-containing molecules occurs in the MOVPE process using a TMAl/TMGa/NH3/H2 system, and those polymers prevent the AlGaN growth.
There are experimental and theoretical works to understand GaN, AlN, and AlGaN MOVPE [24], [25], [26], [27]. Creighton et al., have observed the formation of gas-phase nanoparticles during AlN and GaN MOVPE [27]. The introduction of the polymer formation in AlN and GaN MOVPE simulations exhibits good agreements with the experimental results [28], [29], [30]. The growth of polymers would make them a nanoparticle size eventually. There are some successful simulations of AlGaN MOVPE using a low-pressure rotating-disk or showerhead reactor [31], [32], [33]. They considered Al- and Ga-containing particles to calculate the AlGaN growth rate and its composition. However, the possible polymers were not shown in those pieces of literature. Also, they simulated AlGaN MOVPE only at low pressures. AlGaN barrier and electron-blocking layers grown by atmospheric pressure MOVPE are used for blue, green, amber, and red InGaN-based LEDs [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Therefore, the understanding of AlGaN MOVPE at higher pressure is valuable to grow those device structures.
In this paper, we study additional polymers possibly included in AlGaN MOVPE. We will also examine the effectiveness of the proposed polymer formation from experimental and numerical comparisons of AlGaN MOVPE under various growth conditions of pressure, temperature, and TMAl / (TMAl+TMGa) inlet ratio.
