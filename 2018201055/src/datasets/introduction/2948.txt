The point of view adopted here has no other ambition than to introduce some elements of reflection about the evolution of the scientific knowledge in management. Therefore, our intention does not constitute, neither a specific and canonical “state of art” in this field, nor an analysis of the different conceptions of the knowledge concept. Much more modestly in this paper, we would try to adopt the point of view of the analysis of activity, in order to describe its contribution to some theories and significant concepts in the management science, when it is used in two directions: on the one hand, as an analyse grid of the more striking evolutions in this scientific field, during the three last decades; on the other hand, as a forecast tool to imagine future evolutions.
For that, initially, we'll describe the main features of analytical framework used, referring to the theories of activity (in particular: Vygotski, 1934a, Vygotski, 1934b; Vergnaud, 1990; Rabardel, 1995; but also Piaget, 1974a, Piaget, 1974b, Piaget, 1975). Then, using this frame of reference, we will focus on the concept of “resource” and the logic of information processing in an attempt to characterize their place in the theoretical developments in management science. This will be made on the basis, voluntary limited, to some epistemological papers, particularly those of Sanchez & Heene (2010) and Prévot, Brulhart & Guieu (2010) but also, by using some references to authors which have influenced these evolutions. We will also aim to understand the interest of a few Piagetian concepts to discuss some main conceptions in management science. Finally, with a resolutely foresight point of view, we will seek to consider how these considerations can outline alternative research avenues and may suggest the knowledge management emancipation from the hegemony of information processing theories, where knowledge is conceived like the product of an interpreted information (Pesqueux & Durance, 2004), that is to say, like a material resource that can be exchanged, stored, transferred… More precisely, it will then be a question of showing that the model (MADDEC) of the competence (Coulet, 2011), presented below, could offer an useful theoretical framework to consider the dynamics of the firm as the organization of a specific human activity articulating individual and collective competencies and in which resources are conceived as mere mediating artefacts of the activity.
