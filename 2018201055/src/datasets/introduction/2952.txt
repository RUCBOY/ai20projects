Achievement goal theory has inspired extensive research in recent decades, but numerous significant challenges remain. One such challenge concerns the measurement of achievement goals (e.g., Hulleman, Schrager, Bodmann, & Harackiewicz, 2010; Elliot & Murayama, 2008). Crucially, questionnaires assessing achievement goals are usually developed by researchers, who decide on question wording for participants (Urdan & Mestas, 2006). However, there might be a gap between young students’ interpretation of statements to which they are asked to respond and the way researchers designed them to measure. It might therefore be promising to instead let students participate in formulating achievement goal items to ensure that they reflect the goals students adopt in real-life learning situations. Accordingly, the present study relied on a citizen science approach, with researchers and secondary school students working together to develop items to assess students’ mastery-approach goals (MAp), normative and appearance performance-approach goals (PAp), and normative and appearance performance-avoidance goals (PAv). Additionally, two large studies in two countries (Austria and the United Kingdom) were conducted to demonstrate the psychometric properties of the newly developed scales and test their relations to a set of antecedents and consequences of the achievement goal types (implicit theories, self-efficacy, reference norms, and reactions to errors).
The remainder of this section is organized as follows: First, we describe achievement goal theory, the guiding framework of the present paper, and briefly review existing work on the relations between achievement goals and implicit theories, self-efficacy, reference norms, and reactions to errors. Second, citizen science is presented as a means to involve students in achievement goal scale development. Finally, we present our hypotheses for the two studies carried out in Austria and the United Kingdom.
