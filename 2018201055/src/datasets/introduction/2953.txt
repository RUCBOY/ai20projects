In recent decades, there has been a great advancement in Information Technology (IT), telemedicine, telehealth and e-health in healthcare systems. Telemedicine and telehealth are important tools for elaboration in healthcare delivery using smartphones, email, video conferencing and other tools especially in rural areas. Telemedicine is the use of electronic information and communication technology to provide and support clinical care remotely, while patient support and professional health related education, public health and health administration when distance separates the participants is considered as telehealth [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Telehealth and telemedicine play a vital role in patient-centered healthcare delivery in diagnosis, and management of chronic diseases and future treatment plan [5]. Further, telehealth enables real time health condition monitoring of chronic diseases by enabling the recording of physiological signs that cannot be observed during clinical visits [6].
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines e-health as the cost effective use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the support of health services, health surveillance, education, knowledge and research [4]. Even though having the advantages of telemedicine, still there are many obstructs and challenges to its adoption, specifically from physicians and other health professions which would vary depending on the organization or the country [[6], [7], [8], [9]]. Apart, there are many possible reasons why the implementation of telemedicine continues to be challenging despite the available literature [[7], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. The success of any new technology depends on many accomplishments including professionalsâ€™ knowledge, skills, and attitudes and working environment in the health organization. Therefore, it is important to make professionals comprehend the new concept of telemedicine and evaluate how far they are professionally ready to accept and provide telemedicine services.
Telemedicine is relatively a new concept in Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Health (MOH), recently established an e-Health strategy that includes the use of telemedicine in order to improve the quality and actability of health care services among patients and healthcare providers particularly in rural/remote areas [12,13]. In order to achieve the goals of telemedicine, MOH launched the national project for telemedicine called as Saudi Telemedicine Network (STN) covering all healthcare facilities in collaboration with Canada Health Infoway and Ontario Telemedicine Network [13].
In the past few years, the use of telemedicine has become widespread among health professionals in various hospitals in Saudi Arabia. An extensive review of literature in the field of telemedicine in Saudi Arabia resulted in few publications in the identification of barriers, challenges of telemedicine, knowledge and attitude of health professionals towards telemedicine [9,12,14]. The present study aims to assess the knowledge of physicians about telemedicine and its applications. Secondly, to evaluate their perceptions and willingness towards adopting telemedicine in their clinical practice in various specializations.
