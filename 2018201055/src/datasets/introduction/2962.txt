A biometric recognition system is an automatic method that recognizes individuals automatically by extracting features from human characteristics such as fingerprint, iris, face, etc. With the increasing demand in a wide range of practical applications, biometric recognition systems are widely deployed over the past decades [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Particularly, due to the increasing need of automatic recognitions and surveillance systems, face recognition (FR) has been received extensive attention from both academia and industries [6], [7], [8]. Meanwhile, as the great demand for storage and recognition, cloud-based services, also known as cloud computing, provide a great opportunity to extricate a face owner from heavy storage and cost-efficient recognition tasks.
However, the widespread usage of face recognition systems has raised new challenges in terms of biometric information control and privacy [9], [10], [11], [12]. Face images can be collected and misused without the permission of the owner during the storage and processing procedures. It becomes even more challenging when these faces are stored and computed by an honest-but-curious service provider (SP). This increases the demand of privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) systems which achieve face recognition and simultaneously protect the privacy of faces.
Existing solutions for PPFR can be classified into two categories, image processing based PPFR and cryptography-based PPFR. Image processing based PPFR invokes the theories of image processing [10], [13], [14]. For example, Newton et al. [10] proposed an image processing based scheme which places original faces with de-identified faces in a video clip, in which the behaviors and actions of the people remain, but the faces are replaced in order to achieve the protection of privacy. Kroshunov et al. [13] proposed a morphing-based privacy-preserving face recognition scheme for video surveillance. Using recognition and detection algorithms, the general facial features are maintained for undistracted conduct of surveillance tasks. Meanwhile, specific key facial information is equally unrecognizable by three existing recognition algorithms. However, these schemes only protect the visual content of faces and provide visual security [15]. In other words, the schemes still cannot prevent facial information from divulging. For example, in [10], an adversary can still obtain the complexions of the de-identified faces; in [13], the facial information of a morphed face may be obtained by advanced recognition algorithms. On the other hand, the accuracy of face recognition may decrease compared with the original ones without privacy protection.
In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in outsourcing image processing and computer vision tasks to cloud-based SPs using cryptographic techniques, such as feature extraction [16], [17], content-based image retrieval [18], [19], and face recognition [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. The advantages of face recognition in the encrypted domain are obvious. First, compared with image processing based PPFR, faces are protected by cryptographic techniques. Second, the accuracy of cryptography-based schemes is always the same as the original face recognition schemes. However, these solutions still suffer many limitations. On the one hand, compared with image processing based PPFR, the cryptography-based schemes are computationally inefficient. Because the heavy cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption algorithms, it is time-consuming to utilize them to encrypt faces and perform FR operations. On the other hand, during PPFR, interaction protocols are needed to handle nonlinear operations [21], [24]. Thus, the communication costs of these schemes are also unsatisfactory.
Inspired by the above limitations, this paper aims to propose a novel scheme to accurately and efficiently achieve privacy-preserving face recognition. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:
•We propose a randomness-based privacy-preserving face recognition scheme to protect outsourced face databases without reducing the recognition accuracy. Six algorithms are involved to accomplish the functionality of the proposed scheme.•We design a novel face encryption algorithm which consists of permutation, diffusion and shift transformations to protect the privacy of face images. Both projection (feature extraction) and recognition procedures are executed in the cloud.•We also propose an optimization technique to increase the efficiency of both the face owner and the SP. The proposed scheme does not need interactions between users and the SP and it is adequate to a variety of face recognition schemes, such as eigenface [25] and fisherface [26].•We present systematic and extensive analysis to evaluate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed scheme.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related work. Section 3 describes the system model and eigenface algorithm. Section 4 illustrates the proposed scheme. Section 5 presents the accuracy, privacy and efficiency analysis. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.
