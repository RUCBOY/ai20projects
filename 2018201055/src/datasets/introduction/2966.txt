The investigation on the conditions under which Turing patterns appear in physical systems has been a highly transited avenue of research from the mathematical, the numerical and the physical points of view. It is well know that many nonlinear systems exhibit Turing patterns under suitable conditions on the parameters of the model and the initial data. Some diffusion-reaction systems exhibit the presence of patterns, like some coupled systems which describe the interaction between inhibitor and activator substances in chemistry [1], [2], especially in chemical reactions with chlorine dioxide, iodine, and malonic acid [3]. In fact, several different Turing patterns are also found in the chlorine-iodide-malonic acid reaction, including hexagonal, striped [4], and oscillatory structures [5]. Outside the chemical sciences, there is also evidence of the presence of this kind of nonlinear behavior. For instance, there is experimental evidence on the presence of azimuthal Turing patterns in Kerr combs generated by whispering-gallery-mode resonators [6], and the theory suggests that diffusion-reaction systems may be used to understand the formation of this type of patterns in biology [7]. Even the labyrinthine structure of the cerebral cortex has been identified as a complex three-dimensional Turing pattern [8], among other applications [9]. Moreover, it is well known that the Brusselator is a system which exhibits the presence of that type of structures [10], [11].
The physical models described in the paragraph above are diffusive equations. It is well known that these systems have the physical limitation that any perturbation is instantaneously propagated throughout the system. For that reason, hyperbolic forms of these equations are physically preferred. It turns out that a wide variety of Turing patterns have been found also in hyperbolic systems. For example, Turing instabilities have been investigated in diffusive predator-prey models with hyperbolic mortality [12], [13], in hyperbolic models for locally interacting cell systems [14], in the hyperbolic chaos of standing-wave patterns generated by a modulated pump source [15] and in the spreading of infectious diseases in hyperbolic susceptible-infected-removed models [16]. Also, the presence of various wave and Turing patterns has been studied in the context of hyperbolic forms of the Brusselator [17], [18], in some hyperbolic models for self-organized biological aggregations and movement [19], in network systems through collective patterns and single differentiated nodes [20], in predator-prey reaction-diffusion models with spatio-temporal delays [21] and in hyperbolic vegetation models for semiarid environments [22], just to mention some systems.
In recent years, fractional derivatives have been introduced to mathematical models in order to provide more realistic descriptions of the physical phenomena. For instance, many fractional systems have been obtained as the continuous limit of discrete systems of particles with long-range interactions [23], [24]. However, independently of that, fractional derivatives have been successfully used in the theory of viscoelasticity [25], the theory of thermoelasticity [26], financial problems under a continuous time frame [27], self-similar protein dynamics [28] and quantum mechanics [29]. Moreover, some distributed-order fractional diffusion-wave equations are used in the modeling of groundwater flow to and from wells [30], [31]. As expected, the complexity of fractional problems is considerably higher than that of integer-order models, whence the need to design reliable numerical techniques to approximate the solutions is pragmatically justified [32]. In this direction, the literature reports on various methods to approximate the solutions of fractional systems. For example, some numerical methods have been proposed to solve fractional partial differential equations using fractional centered differences [33], [34], the time-fractional diffusion equation [35], the fractional Schrödinger equation in multiple spatial dimensions [36], the nonlinear fractional Korteweg–de Vries–Burgers equation [37], the fractional FitzHugh–Nagumo monodomain model in two spatial dimensions [38], distributed-order time-fractional diffusion-wave equations on bounded domains [39] and some Hamiltonian hyperbolic fractional differential equations that generalize various well-known equations from quantum field theory [40].
In light of these facts, the investigation on the presence of Turing patterns in fractional systems (in both the parabolic and hyperbolic types) has been also an interesting topic of research in recent years. Some reports have studied the presence of these patterns in simple models with fractional diffusion [41], in fractional reaction-diffusion systems with indices of different order [42] and with multiple homogeneous states [43], in hyperbolic inhibitor-activator systems with fractional diffusion [44], in two-species fractional reaction-diffusion systems [45] and in reaction models with sub-diffusion [46]. At the same time, various numerical methods have been proposed in the literature to investigate complex nonlinear models [47], [48], [49]. Motivated by these facts, the purpose of this work is to investigate numerically a two-dimensional hyperbolic system with superdiffusion that describes the interaction between an activator and an inhibitor in chemical reactions. For convenience, we will study a generalized form of the physical model, and provide a discretization of this system using fractional centered differences. Using some properties of fractional discrete operators and a fixed-point theorem, we will establish the existence (and, ultimately, the uniqueness also) of solutions of the numerical method. By employing the standard argument with Taylor polynomials, we will show that the method is a second-order consistent technique. The discrete energy method will be employed then to prove the stability and the convergence properties of our technique. Some computational experiments will be carried out in order to verify the validity of our code and to propose an application to subdiffusive systems.
This work is sectioned as follows. In Section 2, we provide the mathematical model under investigation, which is a system of hyperbolic partial differential equations with fractional diffusion in two spatial dimensions. Some sufficient conditions for the presence of Turing patterns are recalled therein, and the generalized form of the physical model is provided. In that section, we also introduce the concept of fractional centered differences, which is the cornerstone to approximate the terms with fractional diffusion. We will record therein some useful properties on fractional centered differences for the sake of convenience. Section 3 is devoted to provide the discrete nomenclature and the numerical method to approximate the solutions of our generalized model. In that section, we also establish that the numerical technique is solvable and provide comments on its computer implementation. The most interesting numerical features of our technique are established in Section 4. More precisely, we show that the method is a quadratically consistent method, which is stable and quadratically convergent. As a corollary, we will notice that our scheme has a unique solution under suitable parameter conditions. Section 5 provides some computer simulations. As an application of our technique, we exhibit the presence of Turing patters in various scenarios. The results will be in qualitative agreement with predictions reported in the specialized literature. Finally, we close this work with a section of concluding remarks.
