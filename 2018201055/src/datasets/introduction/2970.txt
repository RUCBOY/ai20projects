In contrast to past research on computation in black holes which focused on the idea of sending a computer into the black hole and exploiting its relativistic properties (as in the case of [7], here it is proposed that the black hole itself be used as a model of computation, motivated by the unique properties arising from holographic duality and the greater feasibility of such a system in the real world. This is achieved by using the energy states of molecules behind the event horizon as the states of the computer, with the movement of the external observer measuring the system corresponding to the shifting of the computerâ€™s tape and the change in states combined with the resulting Hawking radiation corresponding to the output. A stream of photons at the appropriate energy levels is used as input to change the states of the computer. In this way a correspondence is formed between the physical and computational models of the system which may then contribute to a proof of its Turing completeness.
In the following sections the methods for essential components of the computer will be developed which will then contribute to the proof of the Turing completeness of this model of computation. The goal is to introduce a model of computation which can be used to investigate the effects of physical constraints imposed by the holographic principle and the Kerr/CFT correspondence on computation and vice versa.
