The surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are electromagnetic quasi-particle excitations created on a metal/dielectric interface by light-matter interactions [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. They involve surface charge density oscillations propagating along the metal/dielectric interface. Under the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) conditions, the component of the momentum of the light along the interface is the same as the component of the momentum of the SPPs in the same direction. Often the SPR is created by using one of the two experimental conditions: (1) Kretschmann configuration or (2) Otto configuration [[5], [6], [7]]. In each experimental condition, a p-polarized beam of light is passed through a high-index prism and made incident upon a thin film metal/dielectric interface. In the Kretschmann configuration the metal film is in direct contact with the prism. But in the Otto configuration, there is an air gap between the prism and the metal film. When p-polarized light is incident upon dielectric/metal interface at an incidence angle θi from the normal to the interface, the momentum match condition for the Kretschmann configuration requires,(1)npsin(θi=θspr)=εmnd2εm+nd2where np is the refractive index of the prism, εm is real part of dielectric constant of the metal, and nd is the refractive index of the material above the metal surface (air in this case). The angle of incidence θi for which SPR occurs is known as the resonance angle θspr. The sensitivity of the sensor to changes in the refractive index of the dielectric placed on the surface of the sensor is defined by(2)Sn=dθsprdnd
The SPPs have strong evanescent fields associated with them [[8], [9], [10], [11]]. These fields decay exponentially with distance increasing from the interface and can be utilized for some very specific applications [12]. Since its discovery decades ago, the SPR phenomenon has led to the development of numerous sensors with applications in bioscience, engineering, chemical, and physical sciences [1,4,[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. The simplest surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor is made of a thin metal film such as silver or gold on glass. Other forms of SPR sensor architectures use stacks of two metal thin films (bimetallic sensors) and more complicated nanostructures consisting of metal/dielectric/metal layers [10,24,25]. For example, a single metal Ag SPR sensor is the simplest and easiest sensor to manufacture. However, silver oxidation results in degradation of the sensor in relatively short period of time [11]. On the other hand, a multilayer nanostructure, like Ag/Si3N4/Au, results in a sensor that lasts longer. Although, its sensitivity is lower than that of a silver sensor. In previous works, we have studied single metal, bimetal, and multilayer nanostructure sensors [25,26]. Each type of nanostructure needs to be carefully evaluated for its advantages and disadvantages; in particular for the sensitivity of the sensor for specific applications, ease/complexity of nanostructure fabrication, and the usable life of the sensor. The Ag/Si3N4/Au multilayer fabrication is relatively complex and requires clean-room NanoFab facility with precise control on materials thickness, impurities, and characterization. But it is highly sensitive, long-lasting, and robust.
