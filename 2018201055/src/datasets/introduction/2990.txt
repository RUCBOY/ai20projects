Photonic lattice is a kind of artificial structure that the dielectric coefficient distribution is periodical, and it is a new type of optical materials. The photonic lattices offer new possibilities to route, control, and steer light in all-optical information processing and nanophotonic devices. This characteristic makes it become an attractive area of international research in recent years. At present people have done a lot of research on one dimensional and two dimensional photonic lattices in photorefractive crystals, and have found a lot of interesting phenomena, such as discrete solitons and discrete diffraction [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. So the fabrication of photonic lattices has always been of great interest. One method of fabricating photonic lattices is optical induction [[7], [8], [9]], this technology is mature and many achievements have been reported [[10], [11], [12]]. We know optical induction relies on the interference of multiple beams. The interference of multiple beams can be decomposed into the interference of each two beams firstly and then added together [13]. However, with the increasing of the number of the beams, both the interference configuration of the beams and the light field structure all become complex. It is very difficult to analyze the light field structure let alone the reverse derivation of the needed beam according to the required light field structure. So a new method is necessary to simplify the interference configuration for further researches on photonic lattices. In this paper, we use a new method which is called multiple groups of double beam alternate interference to fabricate the photonic lattices. The structure of the light field obtained by this method has more concise symmetry compared to that obtained directly by the interference of multiple beams. We fabricate two-dimensional square photonic lattices and analyze its structure by plane wave guiding, Brillouin zone spectroscopy and far field pattern and we make computer simulation to the light field pattern. Besides, we obtain the computer simulation pattern of the five groups of double beam alternate interference. and we can see the regular decagonal photonic lattice structure in the pattern.
