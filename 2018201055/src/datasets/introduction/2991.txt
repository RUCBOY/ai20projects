The PCR machine has obvious application value in the fields of medicine, biology and so on [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. The main working principle of the PCR machine is similar to the natural replication process of DNA, that is, double-stranded DNA can be denatured into a single-strand DNA under the action of various enzymes. Under the action of DNA polymerase, the single-strand DNA can be copied from itself into a new one, according to the principle of complementary base pairing. The PCR consists of three basic reaction steps: denaturation-annealing-extension. (1) Denaturation of the template DNA: The template double-stranded DNA or double-stranded DNA amplified by PCR is dissociated to a single strand after heating to approximately 93 °C for a certain period of time, making it convenient to be combined with the primer in preparation for the next round of reactions; (2) Annealing (refolding) of the template DNA and the primer: The template DNA is denatured into a single strand by heating, and the temperature drops to approximately 55 °C. Then, the primer combines to the template of the single strand DNA through the principle of complementary base pairing; (3) Extension of the primer: The conjugate of the DNA template and primer can develop a new semi-reserved replication strand complementary to the template DNA strand according to the principle of complementary base pairing and semi-conservative replication, with dNTP as the reaction material and the target sequence as a template, under the action of Taq DNA polymerase. By repeating the cycle-denaturation-anneal-extension process, more "semi-reserved replication strands" can be obtained, and this new strand can be used as a template for the next cycle. It takes a short time to complete a cycle, and the gene that needs to be amplified can be amplified several million times in 2–3 hours [5]. At present, the PCR machine mainly includes conventional PCR, gradient PCR, in situ PCR, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Among these, the most widely used are conventional PCR and qPCR [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Compared with conventional PCR, qPCR includes the fluorescence signal acquisition system and computer analysis processing system. The primers added in the amplification are marked with fluorescein, and the primers and fluorescent probes are combined with the template at the same time [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. The results of the amplification are collected in real-time by the fluorescence signal acquisition system, while the quantitative real-time output results are obtained by the computer analysis processing system. However, the cost shown in Table 1 of qPCR on the market is usually approximately 10 times the cost of conventional PCR. Therefore, it is of great significance to realize qPCR by simply modifying conventional PCR.Table 1.

At present, ubiquitous smartphone technology for portable chemistry and biometrics is evolving [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]], a large number of researchers have carried out studies on qPCR through fluorescence detection using a smartphone or camera [2,21,[23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]]. It can be observed that combining a smartphone and personal computer with a conventional PCR machine is a feasible way to achieve quantitative real-time PCR.
However, there are certain difficulties in the process of achieving qPCR with the combination of fluorescence detection by smartphone and a conventional PCR machine. Since the long-term illumination of light would cause the deterioration and discoloration of fluorescent dyes, the qPCR requires the signal detection mode of interval photographing. That is, photographing is normally performed only during the denaturation or extension stage. In most of the documents, photographs are manually taken at regular time periods, making it very inconvenient [22,23,31]. When the software installed on the phone was used to control the taking of photographs at regular time periods, it is found that the actual picture taking interval of the camera should be the software setting time plus the response time and exposure time of the camera [23,32,33]. Although the exposure time of the camera can be set, the response time of the camera varies with different working conditions [22]. Hence, it can be observed that the actual interval for photographing is difficult to control.
From the perspective of photoelectric control, the present study combined a conventional PCR machine with a smartphone and personal computer, and designed an optical and electrical feedback automatic fluorescence detection system to achieve the quantitative real-time PCR.
