With the development of cloud computing and Internet of things, cloud manufacturing comes into being. In cloud manufacturing environments, product design data sharing is very frequent. However, copyright disputes are inevitably arisen during the process of data transmission and sharing. As most product design data is represented by 2D CAD engineering graphics, effective technical means for protecting the intellectual property rights of 2D CAD engineering graphics is of great importance.
As an important copyright protection means, digital watermark has been widely developed and implemented in recent years. Reversible visible watermarking is a kind of digital watermarking which can visually label the copyright by watermark information, and the watermark can be completely removed by the authorized users [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Currently, the existing reversible visible watermarking schemes are all proposed for raster images. As the basic component of 2D CAD engineering graphics is entity, which is completely different from the pixel of the raster images, the existing reversible visible watermarking techniques are not suitable for 2D CAD engineering graphics. Other than reversible visible watermarking, many works have been done to 2D CAD engineering graphics on reversible invisible watermarking. Typical methods include lossless compression [6], difference expansion [7], [8], [9], [10], quantization index [11], [12], [13], [14], and virtual vertex [15], [16], [17]. For these methods, watermark information is invisibly embedded into the host graphics, thus it cannot satisfy the application scenario that needs to visibly identify the copyright of 2D CAD engineering graphics. Therefore, the construction of reversible visible watermarking for 2D CAD graphics needs a new perspective.
In this paper, we put effort to constructing a reversible visible watermarking dedicated for protecting 2D CAD engineering graphics. Given a watermark graphics and a host graphics, the watermark graphics is fused with the host graphics based on a secret key, and the host graphics can be completely recovered by authorized users. The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
(1) Watermark graphics perturbation and graphics fusion are put forward for the construction of reversible visible watermarking for 2D CAD engineering graphics, and they significantly increase the difficulty of removing the watermark graphics.
(2) A reversible visible watermarking is proposed for 2D CAD engineering graphics based on graphics fusion. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work on reversible visible watermarking for 2D CAD engineering graphics.
(3) Experimental results and analysis demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness against translation, rotation, scaling and entity deletion. Furthermore, the malicious removing of watermark graphics will result in significant damage to the host graphics.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The related work is introduced in Section 2; The graphics processing and graphics fusion are presented in Section 3; the proposed reversible visible watermarking scheme is described in Section 4. Experimental results and analysis are provided in Section 5. Finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
