By 2008, the average elementary public school had 157 computers in use for instructional purposes (Gray, Thomas, & Lewis, 2010). With the rise of school technology infrastructure, more instructional software programs are being implemented within these schools (Gray & Lewis; Greenhow, Robelia, & Hughes, 2009). There are benefits to these programs; meta-analyses have shown the positive learning effects of computer-based instruction (CBI) for elementary students, including improvements in mathematics performance on standardized and teacher-created tests (Li & Ma, 2010) and small to medium-sized effects across subject areas (Chauhan, 2017). One of the benefits often touted for CBI is individualization—CBI offers students the opportunity for individualized student learning in a manner more efficient than what teachers may be able to accomplish on their own, as computer programs can both assess and provide students with instruction that meets them where they are (Gibbons, Nelson, & Richards, 2002).
Although these programs may offer efficiency, they also add an additional time burden to the already restricted school day—teachers must schedule time for students to interact with the software. Given the proliferation of these programs and the pressures on schools to perform in basic subjects, such as reading and math, it may be useful to understand where teachers find the time for their CBI. Teacher time allocation is an important aspect of the ecology of CBI implementation. In addition, greater understanding of such allocation may illuminate whether the effects of CBI are situated in the learning program itself, or the additional time allocated to a particular subject, as CBI is often supplemental to the normal school curriculum. We explore these ideas within this study, using the implementation of one elementary math CBI as a case study to investigate how teachers report spending their time and from which subjects they report reallocating time in order to implement the CBI.
