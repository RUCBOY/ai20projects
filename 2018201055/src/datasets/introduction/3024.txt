Computer viruses are a kind of self-replication malicious codes or programs which can infect other computers via internet connections [1]. They can spread among computer networks which resembles the biological viruses infection between peoples. They can disrupt the hardware and software, and cause enormous financial losses. Hence, they have become a great threat to human society as Internet applications are more and more popular in our work and daily life [[2], [3]].
In order to reduce the damage of computer viruses, it is necessary to develop mathematical models to understand their behavior. Since the propagation of computer viruses is similar to the transmission of the infectious disease, the classical epidemic models, such as SIS models [4], SIR models [5], SLA models [[6], [7]], SLRS models [8], SEIRS models [9], etc., were employed to describe how computer viruses spread over the Internet. Some other kinds of models, such as delay models [[10], [11]], stochastic models [[12], [13]], Markov models [[14], [15]], network models [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]], were also proposed.
To prevent the spread of the computer virus, an optimal continuous control strategy is studied in [8]. Motivated by the success of pulse vaccination control strategy in the infectious disease control, pulse controls for computer viruses are taken into account in [22]. The pulse controls, releasing new version of anti-virus software or patching operation system, are implemented periodically. However, the users may not detect the virus when the number of infected computers is below a threshold in practice. Hence, they carry out the measures against viruses when the number reaches the threshold.
In this paper, we consider the impact of media coverage on the spread of viruses. We use a nonlinear incidence rate function rather than bilinear interaction in these above works. When the outbreak of viruses is reported by media, the users may not connect some malicious websites to reduce the risk of viruses infection. We formulate a state dependent impulsive differential model based on the work in [23], and discuss the existence, uniqueness and stability of order-1 periodic solution. We find that the period of order-1 periodic solution is longer than that without media report, i.e., media report can delay the spread of computer viruses.
The subsequent material are organized as follows. Section 2 presents the state dependent impulsive control strategy for a computer viruses model with media coverage. The existence and uniqueness of order-1 periodic solution is studied in Section 3, and the stability results are obtained in Section 4. Section 5 investigates the impact of media coverage by theoretic and numerical analysis. These two different periodic solutions are illustrated by numerical simulation in Section 6. Finally Section 7 concludes this work.
