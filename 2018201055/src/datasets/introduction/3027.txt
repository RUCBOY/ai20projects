Since the dawn of the nuclear age, access to the most recent nuclear data played a crucial role in nuclear physics research and application development. These data were originally disseminated as paper copies for designated users and eventually evolved into the present-day computer files distributed over the World Wide Web. The National Nuclear Data Center (NNDC), Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and Nuclear Data Section (NDS), International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have always been pioneers in nuclear data collection, evaluation, and dissemination. They have been providing remote electronic access to their databases and other information since 1986. In this work the authors will concentrate on the present state of storage, analysis and worldwide distribution of low- and intermediate-energy nuclear reaction data.
EXFOR experimental nuclear reaction database [[1], [2]] is the world’s prime repository for reaction data compilations. The EXFOR library was established in 1967 at a meeting of the four major nuclear data centers: Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY (Area # 1, USA, Canada); Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA) Databank, Paris, France (Area # 2, Western Europe and Japan); International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, Austria (Area # 3, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, Africa, Australia and Oceania); and Institute of Physics and Power Engineering (IPPE), Obninsk, USSR (Area # 4, Soviet Union) [[1]]. This project was based on previously-existing efforts, such as the NNDC predecessor’s Sigma Center Information Storage and Retrieval System (SCISRS) and the associated format. Currently, the EXFOR project is an international collaboration under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and 13 nuclear data centers from the USA, OECD/Data Bank (France), IAEA/NDS (Austria), Russian Federation, China, Hungary, India, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, and Ukraine regularly contribute to it.
