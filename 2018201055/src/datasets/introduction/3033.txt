In recent years, the hardware of traditional computers is limited by Moore’s Law. So researchers are increasingly concerned about the study of new types of computers, such as DNA computer, quantum computer, and optical computer and so on [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Because of the characteristics of light, such as the high information capability, high parallelism and so on, optical computing has become a common focus.
Compared with electronic computing, optical computing has advantages: low power consumption, numerous data bits, easy expansion, etc. [[5], [6], [7], [8]]. Using the advantages of optical computing, the architecture and theory of Ternary Optical Computer (TOC) were proposed [[3], [4]]. In TOC, information is expressed with two mutually orthogonal polarized light states (such as vertical polarization and horizontal polarization of light) and no-light state [4]. The processor has many data bits and these data bits can be bitwise reconstructed and grouped, and computational function of each data bit can be reconfigured at runtime. This makes TOC own more advantages over traditional computer systems in solving problems that require more resources and computations.
Through many years research, many meaningful achievements on TOC have obtained. Such as Decrease-radix Design Principle [9], data bits management theory [8], decoder [[10], [11]], MSD adder [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16]], vector matrix multiplication [[17], [18]], three-valued programmable cellular automata [19], MSD iterative division algorithm and implementation [20], FFT algorithm implementation and DFT algorithm implementation [[21], [22]], and performance analysis of a TOC [23], design and implementation of positive and negative discriminator of MSD data for Ternary Optical Processor (TOP) [24] and so on.
However, even much progress has been obtained in TOC, the interaction between TOC and user is still relatively weak. This means user must understand the details about the working mechanism and hardware implementation when using TOC. It seriously restricts TOC’s application and promotion. In order to solve this problem and make full use of TOC’s advantages, a new computing-data model is proposed. Meanwhile the corresponding computing-data file for this model as well as the implementation method for using the model file is designed which successfully establish a bridge between users and TOC. This study lays an important foundation for the application of TOC. The Computing-data file is also called as San Zhi Guang (SZG) file.
