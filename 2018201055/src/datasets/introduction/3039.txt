Technology has become an important tool for many non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and groups collecting data in the developing world. For example, technology can provide people in remote regions with access to financial services and allow organizations to collect vital information within communities they serve. Information and Communication Technology for Development (ICTD) is the study of what technology can accomplish and how technology is used in such low-resource settings around the world. ICTD takes a broad definition of “low-resource”. Areas affected by poverty are frequently the focus of ICTD, but any setting where things like limited connectivity, unreliable power, or lightly skilled personnel conspire to create a unique technological landscape might be relevant to ICTD. Although there have been some efforts to study and address computer security and privacy risks with technologies in an ICTD environment, both on a case-by-case basis for specific technologies and from an academic perspective, e.g., (Ben-David et al., 2011, Corrigan-Gibbs and Chen, 2014, Reaves et al., 2015), the space of “computer security meets ICTD” is still in its infancy. We contribute to this space through insights into how to evaluate and address computer security risks in ICTD environments.
To provide a foundation for our insights, we choose to focus on a particular class of technologies—data collection toolkits—and, in particular, a specific, widely-used instance of such a technology: Open Data Kit (ODK). Data is crucial for many NGOs and researchers to monitor and evaluate deployments or interventions and report to donors on activities. For example, organizations might collect patient information during clinic visits, assess the prevalence of pests in rural farmland, or document infrastructure in need of repair. ODK allows digital forms to be created without deep technical expertise, and has been used as a platform by numerous organizations. By studying computer security risks with ODK, we are able to extract lessons for both ODK and other data collection deployments, as well as infer lessons for other new ICTD technologies.
This work is a collaboration between an ICTD research group and a computer security and privacy research group and leverages methodologies from both communities. For example, our threat model for data collection technologies (Section 4) is the result of a large threat modeling process (used in computer security) that involved many members from both groups. We augment that with surveys and semi-structured interviews, and leverage our past experiences (within our ICTD research group) in conducting deep investigations with key stakeholders (Sections 6 Survey findings, 7 Interview findings). Our threat model provides an analytic overview of the potential issues for data collection technologies, and the surveys and interviews provide a context within which to appropriately interpret and evaluate the risks of threats that we identified.
Contributions. Our contributions are three-fold. First:
•Threat Model. We develop a threat model for ODK and other data collection systems.
Our threat model provides a broad, encompassing view of the possible threats to an ODK-like system, including possible adversaries and adversarial methods. However, computer security is not a binary property and just because a computer security attack might be possible does not mean that it is likely to happen in practice. Hence, a more nuanced approach to computer security is to not only identify the possible threats, but to understand the broader context for a deployed system. Providing an informed, broader contextual analysis is our second key contribution:
•Survey and Semi-structured Interviews. We report on a survey and semi-structured interviews with ODK deployment architects.
We use the results of the survey and interviews to extract insights into how ODK deployment architects think about security. “Think about security” is intentionally broad; we consider, for example, not only how deployment architects perceive threats, but what defensive mechanisms they have deployed and why, what incidents they have encountered and how they responded, and so on. Finally:
•Broader Synthesis and Recommendations. We consider overarching implications and recommendations.
Among the key takeaways: as in the developed world, computer security of data collection platforms in the developing world is about risk management. Though our survey and interviews surfaced real threats and security concerns—particularly about data loss and erroneous or fake data—many of the threats we consider abstractly seem to have not yet manifested in practice for many of the deployments we studied. Hence, the current level of security seems arguably appropriate in today's environment, particularly given the practical tradeoffs faced in balancing security with other deployment goals. However, ICTD systems (and their data) may persist for many years, and the risks may change over time, making it important for organizations to proactively consider and revise their threat models.
