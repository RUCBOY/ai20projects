Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is one of the most basic methods in signal analysis and a useful tools for analysis of finite length sequence, including spectral analysis, high-speed convolution (linear filtering), filter, signal detection and estimation, system identification, audio compression (e.g., MPEG-II AAC), sound synthesis and many other applications. However, because of huge amount of calculation, a high-speed DFT calculation algorithm, Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used as the key technology. There are four typical structures for traditional electronic computer to implement FFT algorithm which include methods with four different structures, that are recursive structure [[1], [2], [3], [4]], cascade structure [5], parallel structure [[6], [7]] and array structure [[8], [9], [10]]. Recursive structure method consumes less hardware resource and control is simple, but the processing speed is slow. Compared with that of the recursive structure one, cascade structure based method consumes more resource. Cascade based method is better and the processing speed is fast than that of the recursive structure based method. As for parallel and array structures based methods, they can be used to accelerate FFT. However, more resource consumption is needed and the implementation is much more difficult. To FFT applications, it is very important as well as necessary to improve the processing efficiency especially for some application scenarios with high real-time requirement.
Compared with the electronic computing, optical computing has great advantages in the applications [[11], [12]] that needs much calculation and can be processed in parallel . Taking use of advantages of huge data bits, optical computing can process FFT with much less clock cycles and energy consumption. So, it is much promising in the applications like FFT/DFT etc.
TOC expresses information with three polarization states of natural light, that is, dark state and two orthogonal polarization of light. Compared with electronic computing, optical computing has many distinctive advantages such as low power consumption, huge number of data bits and easy to extend. This makes it be advantageous over the traditional computer system in problem-solving that needs much more calculation and resources. TOC is a photoelectric hybrid computer proposed in 2003 [13]. Through many years exploration, many interesting research results have been obtained. Such as decrease-radix design principle [14], decoder [[15], [16]], MSD adder [[17], [18], [19], [20]], Application of vector–matrix multiplication [[21], [22]], MSD iterative division algorithm and implementation [23], tri-valued programmable cellular automaton [24] and so on. In addition, implement methods of reconfigurable processor were proposed to confirm the advantages of TOC that giant data-bits parallel computing and reconfigurable processor [[25], [26], [27], [28]]. For example, literature [29] proposed a double-rotator-structure ternary optical processor (DRSTOP), which implemented giant data-bits parallel computing and reconfigurable processor. These studies show that TOC is suitable for high efficiency FFT applications.
To make use of the advantages and combine the current state of TOC, DFT application is studied. Extensive experiments and the error analysis were done. The results show TOC is very promising in the applications that need large amount of calculation and can be processed in parallel. The study of the paper can be used as the basis for further study of FFT or DFT applications.
