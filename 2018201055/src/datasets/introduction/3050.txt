Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a major tumor suppressor with pleiotropic functions on cell survival, proliferation, and chromosomal integrity.1, 2 Cytosolic loss of function (PTEN-) leads to hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway, an event which is common to NSCLC.3, 4 Loss of nuclear PTEN leads to an unstable genome with increased mutational burden, sensitizing cells to DNA-targeting drugs such as cisplatin.5, 6 There is no validated clinically effective special treatment for PTEN- cancers yet, but substantial research and drug development for the PTEN/PI3K axis is ongoing, in particular regarding PI3K inhibitors, for which PTEN- is a surrogate marker. There are phase I and II clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors in solid tumors and NSCLC, respectively, as well as in castration-resistant prostate carcinoma requiring assessment of PTEN status.7, 8, 9
PTEN is not only an important predictive biomarker for PI3K inhibition, but it has recently been reported that PTEN- might be a mechanism of resistance to cancer immunotherapy, for example, in metastatic uterine leiomyosarcoma.10 In mouse melanoma cells, PTEN- promoted resistance to T cell–mediated immunotherapy such as anti–programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), by decreasing T cell infiltration and expansion in tumors.11 Such loss causes an immune-suppressive microenvironment by activation of regulatory T cells and inhibition of natural killer cells.12, 13 In lung squamous cell carcinomas (LSCC) loss of liver kinase B1 (LKB1) and PTEN led to elevated PD-L1 expression.14 However, in high-grade lung neuroendocrine carcinoma, no significant correlation among PTEN loss, immune cell infiltration, and PD-L1 expression on either tumor cells or immune cells was found.15 Finally, there are different micro-RNAs (miR-21, miR-92b, R-26b, and miR-181a) regulating PTEN expression, thereby affecting cell growth, migration, and resistance/sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapies.16
The poor prognostic value of PTEN- has been described in various cancers.17, 18, 19 In NSCLC, two studies in 2012 showed that protein loss as measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) occurs in up to 21% or up to 59% of LSCC. For lung adenocarcinomas (LADC), the frequencies were 4% and 34%, respectively.20, 21 Both studies used the 138G6 antibody and PTEN- was defined as absence of any immunoreactivity. An earlier study in 2005 found a complete loss or reduced PTEN protein expression in 74% of NSCLC, whereby reduced expression was defined as positive staining of any intensity in less than 50% of the tumor cells using the 6H2.1 antibody.22 In high-grade lung neuroendocrine carcinoma, complete loss of PTEN protein was found in 9.5% using the 28H6 antibody.15
Therefore, clinical assessment of PTEN status is important, but lacks standards. Determination of protein loss by IHC is considered the best approach, as it integrates various regulatory networks acting on the enzyme. IHC is assumed to be superior to sequencing because more PTEN- cases have been detected by IHC than by sequencing in endometrial carcinoma.23 In particular, PTEN protein loss was detected by IHC in 44% of cases classified as PTEN wild-type by sequencing. In high-grade lung neuroendocrine carcinomas, PTEN IHC expression had no correlation with PTEN mutation status assessed by genomic analysis.15 Given that PTEN is a tumor suppressor, protein loss rather than overexpression is pathologically and clinically relevant. Therefore, the low-level expression range close to H-score 0 is crucial to evaluate a potential PTEN-.
Mindful of the discrepant results for the 138G6 antibody, we first evaluated different staining protocols for PTEN IHC across the European Thoracic Oncology Platform (ETOP) laboratories and determined an optimal H-score threshold value for PTEN-. The SP218 clone was used alongside the established 138G6 and 6H2.1 antibodies. Pathologists’ H-scores were compared with a novel approach of objective computerized pixel-based intensity measurement calibrated by pathologists. We investigated the prevalence of PTEN- and its correlation with clinicopathologic data in the ETOP Lungscape cohort of 2245 resected NSCLC patients.
