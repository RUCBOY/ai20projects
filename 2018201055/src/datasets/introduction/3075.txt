Neutron induced reaction cross-section (T´ark´anyi et al., 2014:Naik et al., 2017) database provides a fair chance to develop a theoretical tool to predict competing reaction cross-section. Fission reaction is a special kind of nuclear reaction (Kaplan, 1962, T´ark´anyi et al., 2014) in which a heavy nucleus such as uranium breaks in to two or more lighter nuclei. This was discovered by Hahn and Strassman in 1939 (Ermias and Gizachew, 2012, Kailas and Mahata, 2014). When a fission reaction is generated by a bombardment of an incident neutron on uranium isotopes (Timo, 2010, Ayhan, 2017), a large amount of energy would be released with fission fragments. Neutron induced fission cross-section data (Kaplan, 1962, T´ark´anyi et al., 2014; Naik et al., 2017) provide a sound basis to extract fission barrier parameters elaborated level density modeling approach and check it's validity up to 100 MeV (Maslov, 2000).
In the case of 235U, 6.2 MeV has to be added to 236U in order to have a fission process (Roy and Nigam, 1967). Nuclear theory, using quantum mechanics, is used to predict the probability that a specific nuclear process will occur under certain conditions. The quantitative measure of this prediction is the cross section of the process. This cross section may be measured in the laboratory using experimental techniques that have been strongly developed in the last decades, investigating nuclear reactions involving radioactive nuclei and playing a crucial role in many areas of basic and applied nuclear sciences (Escher, 2008).
As to the report of Opera et al. (2014), theoretical and experimental reaction cross section values obtained for nuclei has been used in many fields of sciences, and one of great interest nowadays is the nuclear meeting ground between theory and experiment. Similarly, Anne (2009) also ratified that some theoretical and experimental research work has been conducted on nuclear reactions induced by energetic neutrons. Nuclear reaction cross-sections (Sneh and Mohindra, 2006, Hodgson, 1972) are intrinsically very complicated and yet in some circumstances they can be treated quite successfully by appropriate models. Broeders et al. (2006) also uncertain calculations of cross-section, for reactions induced by neutrons with energy above 0.1 MeV using nuclear models and computer codes having direct relations to the generation of nuclear data files, and comparisons of the experimental data with evaluated cross-sections from nuclear data files. Even up to this day, prescription and comparison of the calculated cross-section (Özdoğan et al., 2016, Naik et al., 2017;) of the theory with the experimental data allows the validity of these models to be assessed, but lacks to give scientific based evidences how to compare the theoretical and experimental nuclear reaction cross-sections.
Taking this problem as research gap, comparison between theoretical prediction and measurement is used to evaluate the significance of the underlying theory as no earlier and clear theoretical reaction cross-sections comparison mechanisms with the experimental one were found in the literature. On the other hand, theoretical calculations are desirable to fill the gaps (Maslov, 2000) for nuclei where fission cross-section data (Kaplan, 1962, T´ark´anyi et al., 2014: Naik et al., 2017) are lacking. Studying neutron capture (Dorsett and Krane, 2015) by radioactive nuclei presents considerable challenges compared with captures by stable nuclei.
A uranium isotope (235U) bombarded with a neutron breaks into two intermediate mass nuclear fragments such as:(1)n01+U92235→U92236→Ba56144+Kr3689+3n01
The gain in binding energy for a nucleon is about 0.9 MeV. Hence, the total gain in binding energy is 240 × 0.9 or 216 MeV (Krane, 1987). The original theory of the fission process was developed on the basis of the liquid-drop model (Roy and Nigam, 1967; Kailas and Mahata, 2014). This model (Kailas and Mahata, 2014) of a nuclear fission is the consideration of a nucleus to be analogous to a charged liquid drop. The drop is considered to deform from a spherical shape into dumbbell shaped on an axis of symmetry (Roy and Nigam, 1967; Gary, 2012).
Different nuclear model (Herman et al., 2007) parameters were adjusted, within their recommended limits, to obtain a good agreement between the theory and experiment (Aslam et al., 2015). Fission is modeled by a gradual transition of the molecules from an initial compact shape to such an elongated shape that the nucleus breaks into two fragments (Kailas and Mahata, 2014).
