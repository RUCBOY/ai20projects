Nodule is the abnormal growth of cells (lumps) within the thyroid gland that may be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) [1], [2]. In general, the occurrence of thyroid nodule among all the cancer cases is reported to be around 0.2% [34], [30], [37], [29]. The prevalence of this type of cancer increases with the age and is one of the most common cancers among women [3]. According to American Cancer Society’s estimates for thyroid cancer, out of 62,450 new cases of thyroid cancer, 6.7% were males and 20% were females and 1950 (1080 women and 870 men) estimated deaths were expected due to thyroid cancer for 2015 in United States [42]. As per these medical statistics, thyroid nodule is a severe disorder leading to high mortality rate. However, the mortality rate can be reduced if cases are detected and treated early by finding the initial symptoms of thyroid nodule [14].
Ultrasound is used as the most common imaging modality for early thyroid nodules detection. It is generally preferred due to its non-ionising radiation effects, inexpensive and painless scanning operations which provide diagnostically important information needed for medical diagnosis [22]. However, the key challenge in automated analysis in ultrasound images is to make accurate nodules segmentation within the thyroid gland. As these images are affected by speckle noise and intensity in-homogeneity that may appear as bright spots. Speckle noise can be described as a texture pattern that changes with the type of biological tissue. It deteriorates the image quality and makes the differentiation of fine details difficult. The major purpose of speckle reduction is to improve the image quality [19], [15] for accurate segmentation of nodules. However, the removal of speckle noise is always a trade-off between edge preservation and noise suppression.
Doctors interpret the ultrasound images to provide effective treatment in order to identify the severity of several thyroid diseases. Occasionally, practitioners make perception and interpretation errors while performing the diagnosis [20]. Perception errors occur when anomalies remain undetected even when it is in sight and interpretation errors occur when a detected abnormality is incorrectly interpreted as benign or malignant. These errors can be due to distractions, endocrinologist exhaustions, Human Visual System (HVS) limitations and experience level. This uncertainty can be finally resolved by invasive procedures such as biopsies and Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA). The critical issue for an endocrinologist is to manually detect the accurate thyroid nodule in the ultrasound image and classify it as benign or malignant [16]. Therefore, Computer assisted detection systems are becoming popular which assist endocrinologists in accurate decision making for interpretation of huge amount of image data [22]. One of the key challenges to be considered in the design of fully Computer-Aided Detection system is to make accurate delineation of nodules with automatic extraction of Region of Interest (ROI) within the thyroid gland. The other challenges are speckle noise suppression in ultrasound images in some intuitive ways so that indeterminacy and fuzziness can be easily handled without using any prior information and human intervention. The goal is to preserve texture details which have high degree of indeterminacy due to resemblance to the speckle noise.
Fuzzy domain is most widely used by the researchers for handling fuzziness [7]. Fuzzy set (FS) is widely used in image processing applications [4]. FS can only deal with the membership degree but is not able to handle the indeterminacy degree of uncertain pixels [44], [45], [46]. Unlike fuzzy logic, neutrosophic logic introduces the extra domain IM that provides a more efficient way to handle higher degrees of indeterminacy that are very difficult to be handled by fuzzy logic. The relationship among classical set, fuzzy set and neutrosophic set is shown in Fig. 1. In case of classical set, TM and FM have either 0 or 1 values and IM = ∅. While in fuzzy set, IM = ∅ but TM and FM are real numbers ∈ [0,1] and sum of TM and FM must be equal to 1. In neutrosophic set, there is no limit on the sum of TM, IM and FM that is TM, IM, FM ∈.]−0,1+[. Statistically, TM, IM and FM are the membership subsets which depend on known and unknown aspects.Download : Download high-res image (76KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Recently, generalization of fuzzy set named as Neutrosophic Set (NS) is becoming popular in image processing applications [8], [19], [20], [38], [9], [31], [39], [18]. Many researchers have used Neutrosophy in variety of applications like image denoising and segmentation which have shown that neutrosophic based methods yield good performance due to their indeterminacy handling capability [38], [8], [10], [18]. Thus, this paper presented a Computer Aided Detection (CADe) system using neutrosophic based speckle removal method and segmentation method that can provide another opinion to endocrinologists for accurate nodule detection and reduction of unnecessary invasive biopsy operations and surgical complications.
The rest of paper is structured as: Section 2 discusses material and Computer aided detection system with speckle reduction and segmentation of thyroid nodules. Section 3 discusses the experiments and results while section 4 gives conclusion.
