Documenting the use of computers in bioscience and medicine is a very dynamic endeavour. Therefore, Computers in Biology and Medicine (CBM) is a journal which was set-up as a forum to publish scientific articles and reviews.1 The content areas include medical disease diagnosis [[1], [2], [3], [4]], medical data [5], information processing [[6], [7], [8]] and dissemination [9]. Medical disease creates the need to build physical problem solutions and computer methods realize the required functionality [10,11]. The problem solutions can take the form of biochemical [12], biocontrol [13], neural simulation [14] and automatic computer analysis systems [[15], [16], [17]]. Keeping track of topic changes in that scientific area is important for steering the use of computing machinery in medicine and biology towards novel and forward thinking applications. However, the diverse and dynamic nature of the forum makes it difficult to track and analyse topics over time.
Bibliographic research aims to provide an overview of trends and issues encountered in dynamic literature [[18], [19], [20]]. As such, it is a meta-analysis method which is applied to a substantial body of research literature [21,22]. Not only the topics and the writing style evolve, also the bibliographic features of the documents change over time. For example, the author supplied keywords in CBM are only captured since 1990. Before that, Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) [23] was difficult and error prone, because a third party had to extract the topic from the paper text. The ability to conduct TDT studies is significant for meta research on science, technology and policy [24,25]. TDT tools can be used to profile research [26,27], document trends and topics [[28], [29], [30]] as well as analyse research impact [31,32]. Linear models can be used to predict incremental change, but they underperform when it comes to predicting disruptive and revolutionary events [33]. Unfortunately, traditional methods use linear models on static data [34]. For example, keyword cluster analysis is static, because the clusters do not reflect change over time. Therefore, these methods cannot be used to document and predict topic changes [33].
To address the issues raised above, we have analysed the topics covered in CBM with static and dynamic keyword analysis methods. We have applied static frequency and cluster analysis to author supplied keywords from all papers published in CBM since 1990. The frequency analysis shows that Support Vector Machine (SVM), Electroencephalography (EEG), and IMAGE PROCESSING are the most widely used keywords in CBM publications. The cluster analysis reveals the structure within the keyword co-occurrence matrix. With a second analysis step, we found the normalized appearance of the most important keywords in yearly intervals from 1990 to 2017. Analysing the normalized keyword appearance reveals the topic change dynamics. In order to interpret these dynamics, we put forward that future topics in CBM will be influenced by Medical (M) needs and advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Feature (F) extraction and medical Data (D) acquisition. Based on these four categories, we found that the most striking topic change happened in AI, namely the transition from Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to SVM. The static and dynamic bibliographic analysis results can serve as a basis for the editorial board to keep CBM relevant for the advancement of science and technology. The bibliometric research results are interesting for the general reader as well, because they reveal both statistical connections between keywords and trending topics. That information is useful when it comes to deciding on what technology to focus.
To substantiate our claim of supporting both editorial management and readers of CBM, we have organized the rest of this paper as follows. The next section introduces the materials used for the bibliographical research. Section 3 presents the research results. These results are discussed in Section 4. The discussion centres on interpreting and relating our findings to the wider research community. The study concludes with Section 5.
