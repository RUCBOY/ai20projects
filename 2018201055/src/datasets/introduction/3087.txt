The 20th century witnessed an explosion in the digital information and communications technologies (ICTs), leading to the concept of the ‘information society’ (Machlup, 1962). While media research dates back to early part of that century (Saettler, 2004), the field of instructional and educational technology is a relatively young academic discipline with scholarly journals in related fields only starting to appear in the 1970s. Such journals serve as important communication systems which reveal the intellectual nature of particular scientific knowledge networks (Garfield, 1972).
By the time the journal Computers & Education was launched in 1976, computer-based (behaviorist) instruction was being trialled in US and UK schools, the UK Open University (1969) and Microsoft (1975) had been founded; Apple was launched the year following, in 1977. In the UK, the Council for Educational Technology (CET) had been established in 1967, defining educational technology as the development, application and evaluation of systems, techniques and aids to improve the process of human learning (CET, 1972). Shortly thereafter, in 1969–70 the US Association of Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) had transitioned from an audiovisual to an instructional technology orientation and was concerned with “the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management, and evaluation of processes and resources for learning” (Seels & Richey, 1994, p. 1).
During the lifetime of Computers & Education, technology has changed the world. Computing has progressed from the mainframe era to the microcomputer era to the Internet era, and as the U.S. Office of Educational Technology (2017) states, “the conversation has shifted from whether technology should be used in learning to how it can improve learning to ensure that all students have access to high-quality educational experiences.” (¶12).
Lee, Driscoll, and Nelson (2004) state that “understanding trends and issues in terms of topics and methods is pivotal in the advancements of research” (p. 225). Content analysis is an invaluable means of interpreting and coding the content of a research discipline and identifying gaps and priority areas for future research. As West (2011) observes,
There is practical value to understanding where we are right now, and where we have been in the very recent past. To understand this, it can be helpful to review some of the journals in our field to see what conversations are being held, research being conducted, tools being developed, and theories being accepted. (p. 60).
Much can be learned from studying the changing accounts, perspectives, voices and interpretations of theory, findings and practice in such a journal as Computers & Education. Research on distance education which is “institution-based, formal education where the learning group is separated, and where interactive telecommunications systems are used to connect learners, resources, and instructors” (Simonson, Schlosser, & Orellana, 2011, p. 126), is closely related to the field of educational technology. Zawacki-Richter and Naidu (2016) conducted a content analysis of Distance Education, a journal which ranks #20 in the Thomson Reuters 2015 Citation Report “Education and Educational Research” category, with an impact factor of 2.021. By analyzing 515 research articles published between 1980 and 2014, they were able to identify the following main themes over seven 5-year time periods: professionalization and institutional consolidation (1980–1984), instructional design and educational technology (1985–1989), quality assurance in distance education (1990–1994), student support and early stages of online learning (1995–1999), the emergence of the virtual university (2000–2004), collaborative learning and online interaction patterns (2005–2009), and interactive learning, MOOCs, and OERs (2010–2014). In a recent study, Zawacki-Richter, Alturki, and Aldraiweesh (2017) analyzed 580 articles published between 2000 and 2015 in the International Review of Research in Open and Distributed Learning (IRRODL). They identified three broad themes emerging over this fifteen-year period: the establishment of online learning and distance education institutions (2000–2005); widening access to education and online learning support (2006–2010); and the emergence of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and Open Educational Resources (OER) (2011–2015). Similar reviews have been carried out on key journals in other disciplines, such as psychology (Cretchley, Rooney, & Gallois, 2010) and business administration (Liesch, Håkanson, McGaughey, Middleton, & Cretchley, 2011).
Computers & Education is one of the oldest, most established and prestigious journals in the field of educational technology and computer-assisted learning with a high impact in terms of citations. Its purpose, as stated on the Elsevier website1 is to: “increase knowledge and understanding of ways in which digital technology can enhance education, through the publication of high quality research, which extends theory and practice”.
This study sought to a) identify and analyze the thematic and conceptual flow of all articles published in Computers & Education b) consider how these reflected the evolving technologies and theories and c) discover how the research topics and concepts semantically related to each other. In so doing, it also aimed to identify priorities for future research in support of the advancement of knowledge in the field.
