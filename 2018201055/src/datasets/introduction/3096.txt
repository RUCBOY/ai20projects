During the recent decades, computer simulations have been extremely successful in describing thermodynamics, structure, and dynamics of condensed phase of matter. Two important methods to carry out computer simulations include molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) techniques [1], [29], [61]. The MD simulation is capable of computing dynamic properties of a system owing to its basis on numerical solution of the classical equations of motion. On the other hand, several techniques have been introduced within MC simulation to make it a suitable method to determine the thermodynamics of phase equilibria; the Gibbs ensemble [59], [65], [64] and Gibbs Duhem [41] methods are two examples to name. The first method has been extensively used to study various models as well as real systems [31], [54], [51], [47], [35], [71], [17], [20].
It is generally accepted that diffusion as a transport process occurs by translation of particles due to thermal fluctuations [3], [57], [33]. Measurement of diffusion is often challenging, and consequently, the error factor is relatively high. On the other hand, various MD simulation methods and free volume theories offer different alternatives to compute transport properties. An example of free volume methods is a theory proposed by Cohen and Turnbull [9]. Based on this theory, statistical redistribution of particles occurs as a result of thermal fluctuations which opens up voids that if it is comparable to the size of particles, a diffusive displacement takes place. In the original Cohen–Turnbull theory, the mean free volume of a real fluid is determined empirically. Laghaei et al. [46] have modified this theory and proposed statistical mechanical relations for the mean free volume and the effective diameter appearing in the theory. The mean free volume is obtained from the generic van der Waals theory [23], [43], [44], [45], [21], [18], [46], [19], [13] and the effective diameter is computed from the virial minimization method [46]. Detailed analysis of the modified Cohen–Turnbull theory has been given for various real and model fluids [22], [14], [15], [16].
The earth’s atmosphere consists of approximately 80% of molecular nitrogen. It is widely used in industry as a cryogenic fluid. Due to its enormous importance in various scientific and engineering fields, many studies have been carried out to determine different physical properties of nitrogen. Several ab initio potentials have been proposed for the nitrogen dimer [4], [69], [67], [48], [40] and computer simulations have been used to study its different thermophysical properties [2], [8], [75], [24], [50], [48], [26], [27], [42].
The present work aims at calculating the thermodynamic properties, self-diffusion coefficient, and shear viscosity of nitrogen fluid by making use of different theories and computer simulation methods. The van der Waals interaction between a pair of nitrogen molecules is modeled by a two-center Lennard-Jones (2CLJ) potential. We use the Gibbs ensemble MC simulation technique to compute the location of the fluid phase envelope and apply the NVT MC simulation method to obtain the equation of state and the site-site pair correlation function. A comparison is given between the computer simulation results and empirical data for the orthobaric densities and the equation of state. The self-diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity are computed utilizing the equilibrium MD simulation method. In addition, the modified Cohen–Turnbull theory and the modified Dullien relation are applied to calculate the self-diffusion coefficient and the shear viscosity, respectively, and the results are compared to the outcomes of MD simulations and empirical data. The mean free volume and the effective site diameter appearing in the modified Cohen–Turnbull theory are provided by the generic van der Waals theory and the virial minimization method, respectively. We provide a detailed analysis of various thermodynamic and transport results.
