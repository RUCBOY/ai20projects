The rapid proliferation of information and communication technology has resulted in a rapid growth of digitized data and has also brought significant attention on research opportunities in Big Data analytics and Business Intelligence in management, social science, and humanity. The trend of Big Data and analytics for Business Intelligence provides great resources and powerful methodology to support the data-driven decision-making process, which is the core of “Business Intelligence.” Many enterprises today are utilizing Big Data to optimize their Business Intelligence process, while the academic research related to Big Data and Business Intelligence has thrived. The number of research papers is increasing very fast. Research topics range from concepts, methodologies, applications, and management. Hence, it is valuable to provide an overview of the published research so that interested scholars can easily know the research profile so far.
For this purpose, we conducted a bibliometric study to examine the academic research output related to “Big Data” and “Business Intelligence” and analyzed publication data obtained from Web of Science, that includes papers indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI), and Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI). The data period is from 1990 to December 31, 2017. Indexed publications with key words of “Big Data” and “Business Intelligence” in their title, abstract or subject are retrieved and analyzed. Findings are then presented.
