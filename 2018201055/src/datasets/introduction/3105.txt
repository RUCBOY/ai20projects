Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the most rigorous study design to evaluate health-care interventions [1]. However, their success relies on patient recruitment, and this can be challenging [2]. Randomization or random allocation has been defined as: the process of assigning trial participants to treatment or control groups using an element of chance to determine the assignments to reduce bias (p.7) [3]. Research has indicated that the concept of randomization is difficult to communicate [4] and that patients can find it challenging to understand [5], [6]. Linked to this, it has been suggested that failure to accept randomization is a major reason for patients declining to participate in RCTs [7].
Guidelines for good clinical practice state that patients must be informed about the purpose of the trial, the treatment options, randomization, and the right to withdraw [8]. Guidance from the UK Health Research Authority (HRA) is available on how to describe randomization in patient information leaflets and recommends that the following points should be explained to patients: the reason for randomizing, that treatment will not be allocated in line with usual clinical decision-making, that treatment will be randomly allocated, and that neither the patient nor the doctor will decide the allocated treatment. In the guidance, it suggests that this process is “akin to drawing lots, tossing a coin, or rolling a die”, although specific details about the patient may be used to ensure groups in the trial are as similar as possible and that the patient is just as likely to receive either/any of the study arms [9].
Much of the research to date has reported on patients' difficulties with understanding randomization via self-reported questionnaires [10], or interview data completed post hoc, based on their responses to hypothetical scenarios [11], [12]. Relatively, little research has examined what recruiters actually say about randomization during recruitment appointments with some exceptions [13], [14], and patients' responses are even less commonly reported. The QuinteT Recruitment Intervention (QRI) [15] has demonstrated the benefit of investigating what is actually said during recruitment appointments [16], [17]. The QRI is an established recruitment intervention that includes a review and analysis of screening and recruitment data, interviews with recruiting clinicians, and audio recordings of consultations with patients where trial information is discussed. Thereafter, an action plan, typically in the form of support and specific training to help improve recruitment, is discussed and agreed with the Chief Investigator of the RCT. The aim of the QRI is to improve information delivery and increase participant recruitment and informed consent. This article is derived from the QRI research program and investigated how recruiters and patients discussed randomization in recruitment appointments. The findings illuminated the reasons why patients find the concept difficult to understand and identified opportunities for improvement. This article presents how randomization is communicated by health professionals and how patients respond to their descriptions, using data from five RCTs with actual or anticipated recruitment difficulties.
