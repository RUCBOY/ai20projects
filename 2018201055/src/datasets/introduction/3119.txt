Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most common reasons of death due to cancer among men [1]. The clinical method of early detection of PCa is through Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test with or without a Digital Rectal Examination (DRE) [2]. Following PSA, possible candidates are subjected to Trans Rectal Ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy. TRUS biopsy can lead to severe complications like meningitis and sepsis [3]. Another major risk with biopsy is the diagnosis of clinically insignificant or indolent cancer [4]. Unnecessary biopsies can be reduced by subjecting patients to mpMRI before performing initial biopsy [5]. Multi-parametric MRI can also minimize over-diagnosis of indolent PCa and enhance diagnosis of clinically significant PCa [5]. However, the manual reading of mpMRI by radiologists are time-consuming due to the large volume of images.
There exists a number of works for automated diagnosis of prostate cancer. Vos et al. [6] distinguished between prostate cancer and benign lesions using pharmacokinetic features and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Niaf et al. [7] extracted first-order statistical features, Haralick features, gradient features and pharmacokinetic features and compared using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB) and SVM classifiers for distinguishing malignant and benign prostate tissues. SVM achieved the highest performance with an AUC curve of 0.89. Liu et al. [8] identified PCa from benign tumours using features extracted from intensity histogram, Histogram of Gradients (HoG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and shape context using SVM classifier. Fehr et al. [9] used texture features and Recursive Feature Selection Support Vector Machine (RFE-SVM) classifier to distinguish cancer and noncancerous tissue with an accuracy (ACC) of 96% and clinically significant and indolent with an accuracy of 93%. Reda et al. [10], [11], [12] used a novel prostate segmentation technique using level set model guided by a speed function that is derived using non-negative matrix factorization. The methods employ a homogeneous 3D Markov-Gibbs Random Feld (MGRF) [13] to represent the spatial relationship of a voxel with its neighbours [10], [12]. They classified malignant and benign lesions of the prostate using a stacked non-negativity constrained autoencoder (SNCAE) and achieved promising results. In a recent work, Reda et al. [14] integrated the PSA screening outcome with intensity features extracted from DW images for the diagnosis of PCa. Litjens et al. [15] identified the initial candidates using a multi-atlas based segmentation of the prostate followed by feature extraction and classification. They used intensity, texture features, pharmacokinetic features, blobness and anatomical features to distinguish PCa lesions from benign/normal cases with a sensitivity of 0.94. Le et al. [16] used SVM classifier and features generated using multimodal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) along with hand-crafted texture features to classify clinically significant and indolent PCa with an AUC of 0.9087. Liu et al.[17] used CNN to classify clinically significant PCa lesions with an AUC of 0.84. Seah et al.[18] used CNN with auto-windowing to distinguish clinically significant PCa lesions from indolent ones with an AUC of 0.84. Chen et al. [19] used a transfer learning approach using CNN to classify clinically significant PCa lesions with an AUC of 0.83. Our proposed work focuses on distinguishing clinically significant PCa from indolent ones. PCa with Gleason Score (GS) ≤ 6 are indolent cancers [20]. Indolent cancers are relatively benign in nature and no treatment is required [21]. PCa with GS > 6 are clinically significant and require immediate medical treatment [21]. Details of existing works that distinguish clinically significant PCa from indolent ones are consolidated in Table 1.Table 1.

Most of the existing techniques use hand-crafted features for diagnosing PCa. Hand-crafted features are not adaptive to data at hand [24]. Even though CNN is explored for diagnosis of PCa in many studies, other deep learning techniques like sparse autoencoders have not been explored yet. Sparse autoencoder in combination with random forest classifier has not been explored much for medical imaging applications even though some works have proven its effectiveness. Zhao et al. [25] used random forest for the classification of hyperspectral images using deep features extracted by Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE). Maji et al. [26] used random forest on top of denoising autoencoder for detection of retinal vessels in fundus images. We have chosen to use random forest classifier in combination with sparse autoencoder.
Various techniques have been explored in literature to solve the class-imbalance problem associated with the classification of clinically significant PCa lesions. Fehr et al. [9] used Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to augment the data for solving the class-imbalance problem. Le et al. [16] performed data augmentation using rigid and non-rigid deformation of MRI data. Seah et al.[18] have performed extensive linear translation, horizontal flipping, rotation and scaling using Keras ImageDataGenerator class for data augmentation. Liu et al.[17] used 3D rotation and slicing for data augmentation. We have explored three resampling techniques including SMOTE to augment the minority class data to balance it with majority class. Our major contributions are:
i.We explored the use of features extracted using sparse autoencoder for the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Even though deep neural networks like CNN is found useful for PCa diagnosis, SAE has not been used in any of the existing works for diagnosis of clinically significant PCa.ii.The existing deep-learning techniques for the diagnosis of clinically significant PCa use either Softmax or SVM classifier in combination with CNN. None of them used random forest to classify features extracted automatically using deep-learning techniques. We used random forest for classification of features extracted automatically using SAE and compared the result with that of others.iii.We explored the use of three resampling techniques, SMOTE, Weka-Resample and ADASYN to solve the class imbalance problem in PCa diagnosis and compared their performance.
