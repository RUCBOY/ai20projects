Presented as two-dimensional equivalents of volumetric metamaterials, metasurfaces are two-dimensional array of small polarizable particles over a subwavelength thickness that show the promise of overcoming the high level of loss typically associated with traditional volumetric metamaterials, can be realized with lithographic approaches, and thus have attracted significant attention [1]. As electrically thin engineered composite layers, their interactions with the electromagnetic (EM) waves are still strong enough to provide unusual an exceptional ability to realize a myriad of interesting functionalities. Spatially uniform metasurfaces are able to perform traditional functions such as perfect [2], and ultra-broadband absorption [3], antenna engineering [4], and polarization transformation [5]. Moreover, the phase-modulated metasurfaces having spatially inhomogeneous surface parameters have been recently proved to enable different scattering functionalities like diffusion [6], [7], [8].
The simple design of highly efficient and high gain feasible antennas is still a great challenge, especially in the microwave region [9]. Recently, although several multi-functional metasurface-assisted transmit- or reflect-arrays with high gain performances have raised a lot of attention [10], [11], [12]; however, their bulky profiles, complex designs, and low aperture efficiencies restrict their applicability in some practical scenarios. Fabry-Perot cavity antenna (FPCA) is an appealing candidate to satisfy such industrial demands. It offers various benefits such as low complexity feeding network and compatibility with established manufacturing technologies [13], [14]. For the first time, the ray-tracing method based on multiple reflections between a partially reflective surface (PRS) and the ground plane was established to describe the high directivity property of FPCAs. By adjusting the cavity height and the reflection magnitude and phase of PRS, a highly directive antenna can be made [15]. These cavities have attracted significant research interest in recent years due to their special EM characteristics [16], [17], [18], [19]. Nowadays, diverse types of these structures having circularly polarized [20], [21], dual band [22], [23], low profile [24], [25], reconfigurable [26], [27], highly efficient [28], [29] and wideband [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35] performances are introduced and studied [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. All the same, in these works, no computer-aided and fast design method is investigated that could be applied to any FPCA with any type of PRS. In addition, the available design approaches relate to the optimization steps of the problem, not the FPCA design [28]. To mitigate the aforementioned drawbacks, by adopting an equivalent circuit model (ECM), a robust and straightforward design algorithm is proposed in this paper.
FPCAs with high aperture efficiencies have been the topics of several studies in recent years through two different approaches [19], [20], [42], [43], [44]. In the first class called “aperture type cavity,” distributed source excitations, superstrate optimizations, and additional modifications on the cavity are employed to enhance the antenna aperture efficiency. Large lateral areas and limited aperture efficiencies (70–90%) pose significant limitations for their use in some applications [45], [46]. In the second category called “non-aperture type cavity,” high gain structures with extremely small footprint areas (λ02∼4λ02) are designed. In this type, in addition to the significant radiation from the top surface, strongly truncated superstructures cause strong radiation from the cavity edges, achieving more than 100% aperture efficiencies. Nevertheless, these antennas typically have a large longitudinal dimension of (λ0∼3λ0), and the reduction of this parameter degrades the sidelobe level of the antenna, approximately in the range of (9–18 dBi) [47], [48], [49], [50], [51].
In this paper, a “non-aperture type” metasurface-assisted FPCA with high gain and highly efficient performances is designed based on the proposed robust and computer-aided design algorithm. Four lateral sides of the cavity are additionally covered with metallic walls; thereby it avoids the waste of radiation power and improves the aperture efficiency. The angular stability of the sandwiched square-shaped metasurfaces makes the corners of PRS to be involved in the directivity enhancement process, yielding a low sidelobe level structure and further increase in the aperture efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, only one or two studies have dealt with FPCAs with metallic sidewalls [26], [27]. For example, in [26], the overall gain of a primary source has been increased only 4.5 dB that is low compared to the typical gain enhancement values. The optimized antenna in this paper has a directivity of 18.6 dBi (a directivity enhancement about 11 dB) which results in an extremely high aperture efficiency of 126%, while the front-to-back ratio and sidelobe level have remained relatively constant compared to the other works. These characteristics show the effectiveness of the proposed automatic design method. Experimental results are in good agreement with the simulations.
