Falls from heights (FFH) are a major problem in construction [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. Research has revealed that FFH account for approximately 48% of serious injuries and 30% of fatalities [7]. Numerous safety policies and procedures have been established to protect people working at heights in construction [8]. For example, scaffolds/platforms and the use fall prevention solutions such as travel restraints systems (e.g. lines and belts) are required when working above a certain height [9].
Yet, despite the considerable amount of research that has been undertaken and the implementation of policies, procedures and the development of protection measures, FFH remain a pervasive problem, particularly for scaffolders and roofers [10]. In China, for example, people working above a height of two metres are required by law to use fall arrest equipment [10]. There has, however, been a reluctance from scaffolders to use a harnesses, in spite of its use being a legal requirement and workers being cognizant of their exposure to a fall [10]. Reasons for such non-compliance have been found to be attributable to discomfort while wearing the harness and the restrictions it place on movement [10]. While such reasons may well have a degree of validity, such workers tend to have a poor awareness and risk perception. Thus, good communication, effective consultation, improved training and reasonable adjustments can often be enough to head off objections to wearing a harness.
But more fundamentally, behavioral and cultural change is required to address the reluctance to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), but this can take a considerable amount of time to implement. To expedite and enact behavioral change, it is suggested that real-time monitoring of harnesses that are worn by people working at heights can contribute to preventing falls. Construction and safety managers require practical methods to monitor and ensure workers are using their harnesses, particularly scaffolders. However, the safety inspection process can be toilsome and is often undertaken intermittently [11]. As a result, safety compliance is unable to be assured and therefore the likelihood a FFH remains a risk.
To address this problem, the research presented in this paper develops an automatic and non-invasive approach using a computer-vision-based method to monitor the use of harnesses. Computer vision-based methods have been widely used in construction. For example, to track workers on-site [12,13], progress monitoring [14], productivity analysis [15], safety and health monitoring [5], automated documentation [5], and postural ergonomic assessment [16].
In comparison with sensing techniques (e.g., Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), Geographical Positioning Systems (GPS) and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB)), which tend to be limited to providing location data for a specific entity being monitored, computer vision can provide a rich set of information (e.g., locations and behaviors of project entities and site conditionss) by analyzing images or videos [5]. While technologies, such as RFID, for instance, have been widely used in construction and applied to an array of PPE types [17], there has been an absence of research that has monitored the use of harnesses. The paper commences by reviewing existing methods that have been used to prevent FFH in construction and then introduces a novel approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN) that can be used to monitor the use of safety harnesses worn by people working at heights. The technical challenges of the developed CNN approach are presented and the implications for future research are identified.
