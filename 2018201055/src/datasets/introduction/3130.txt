Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an established field with a record of successful use over decades in academic research [1] and industrial R&D [2], [3], [4]. In fact, due to the general challenge in modelling fluid flows, CFD encompasses many specialized subfields focusing, e.g., on aerodynamics with turbulent flows, suspensions, porous media fluid flows, and multiphase fluids. Modelling the dynamics of droplets is a specific example of multiphase (or multicomponent) fluid flows. Droplet formation and dynamics are integral part of many industrial and technological processes, like spray and printing applications, along with being ubiquitous in nature, and hence already a large number of studies have concerned droplets and their dynamics [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Moreover, as a system with versatile physics involved, droplets have been also good validation benchmarks for various CFD methods [10], [11], [12].
Numerous studies concerning droplets have been conducted with the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, including falling droplets [13], [14], droplet to droplet collisions [15] and impacts and interactions of droplets with different kind of materials [16], [17], [18], [19], especially hydrophobic [20], [21] and superhydrophobic surfaces [22], [23], [24]. Over the years, also LB results have been validated by simulating various systems such as channel flows [25] and bubbles in liquid [26] and comparing numerical results to experimental data. In addition to those, recently the LB method has been also benchmarked in the case of droplet dynamics on surfaces [27], [28].
On the other hand, experimental validation of simulated droplet dynamics have usually been made by comparing various (system level) quantities or variables, or by observing still visualizations and images, i.e. snapshots from a physical incident (see e.g. Refs. [29], [30], [31]). Here our aim is to demonstrate an experimental validation procedure which captures dynamically the droplet shape and position. The direct comparisons enabled by the procedure are valuable, generally speaking, as they provide further understanding on the capabilities of computational methods (and the underlying mathematical models) including their potential in applications.
Specifically, in this study we applied LB simulations, high-speed video recording and computer vision to accomplish dynamic one-on-one comparison through the entire droplet impact event. Experiments were performed with three different liquids (deionized water and two glycerol-water mixtures) and on hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surfaces. Impacts of droplets with various features were recorded, simulated and compared. While in this article we concentrate on droplet impact on surfaces, the methodology developed and presented can in principle be applied to many other multiphase fluid systems.
