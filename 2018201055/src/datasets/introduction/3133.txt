Axillary lymph node (ALN) status is a key indicator in assessing and determining the treatment strategy for patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer [1], [2], [3]. The use of less invasive sentinel lymph node (LN) biopsy or non-invasive methods to predict ALN status is increasing since conventional axillary surgery is associated with complication and morbidity such as lymph edema, range-of-motion restriction, and arm paresthesia and pain [4], [5]. Combining several nomograms to predict the probability of ALN metastases before or after sentinel LN biopsy have been developed and are widely used to assist in the choice of the optimal patient treatment [6], [7].
The axillary ultrasound (US) has also been utilized to detect and guide a biopsy of suspicious ALN [8]. The results could be applied to determine whether to execute the sentinel LN biopsy or perform LN dissection for axillary staging in some patients [9]. However, the accuracy of axillary US examination for determining ALN metastases is not enough to obviate an axillary surgery in breast cancer. The ranges of sensitivity were 48.8% to 87.1% and 26.4% to 75.9% when the LN size and morphology were considered bases of decision models, respectively [8]. The prognostic variable in patients with early stage breast cancer may be sourced from tumor characteristics such as tumor size, grade, micro-vessel density, and lymphovascular invasion [10]. Indeed, previous studies suggest that sonographic features of a primary tumor have the potential to predict ALN status in the preoperative staging of breast cancer [11], [12]. Moreover, a computer-aided prediction (CAP) system was proposed by using features from abnormal tissue around the tumor [11].
Since cancer spreading extent is uncertain and susceptible to stage of cancer variability, the region of the tumor surrounding tissue analysis for pattern recognition on images was subjectively and empirically determined by expert observers. Instead of performing image matting [13] on the surrounding tissue segmentations in the CAP of ALN status study [11], this work simplifies the pre-processing of feature extraction and quantifies the substitute features by analyzing the segmented tumor. In order to develop the discriminative features and to predict the probability of ALN metastases from primary tumor characteristics, an automatic segmentation method with feature selection skills were used along with classifier on breast US images. All quantitative features, which have been employed in computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to identify malignant tumors in early stage [14], were collected and further applied to propose a novel CAP system for ALN metastasis in this study.
