Near-Earth asteroids (NEA) provide good opportunity to get the maximal complete (for ground-based observations) phase dependence of the polarization including the value and position of the maximum degree of polarization (Pmax,αmax). It is of great interest to determine the optical and physical characteristics of particles in the regolith layer of asteroids. First of all, using empirical relation log pv = −0.71log Pmax − 1.63, which reflects the relationship between the geometric albedo pv of the surface and the maximum polarization, one can obtain albedo of the surface (see, e.g. [1]). However, polarimetric observations of NEA at large phase angles are still very rare and do not cover the entire main types of asteroids. At the present time the polarization curves for wide phase angle range were obtained only for S- and E- type asteroids. They are presented in Fig. 1.Download : Download high-res image (170KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Observations confirm the phenomenological Umov effect [4]. The maximum degree of polarization E-type asteroids was much lower (Pmax = 1.7 ± 0.2%) then (Pmax = 8.1 ± 0.2%) for S-type asteroids in the V-band [5], [6]. But the unexpected feature was that the polarization maximum position for E-type asteroids was significantly shifted towards small phase angles (αmax = 71 ± 10°) in comparison with (αmax= 110 ± 10°) for S-type asteroids. The effect of particle properties on the polarization characteristics of scattered light was studied in a number of papers (see, e.g. [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]). However, in these works, the difference in the position of the maximum polarization of different asteroids was not explicitly studied. This paper is devoted to the study of this observed effect. We focused on the influence of real and imaginary parts of the refractive index on the linear polarization maximum. Certainly, the polarization maximum and its position also depend on the sizes and structure of regolith particles, this is a topic for further research.
In this paper we found an analytical expressions (using Hapke's approach) and carried out a computer simulation. Theoretical approach is described in Section 2. Section 3 is devoted to computer simulation and description of its results. Section 4 summarizes the main results of paper.
