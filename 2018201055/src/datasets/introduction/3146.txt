Discontinuous metal films grown on dielectric substrates [[1], [2], [3]] or composite films of metal/dielectric structure [4,5] are typical examples of systems consisting of a large number of individual objects. These systems can be investigated experimentally, theoretically, or by computer modelling; however the best research results are derived by the combination of several approaches, especially by particle computer simulation based on own experimental data [[6], [7], [8]]. The simulation techniques used are either the molecular dynamics [3,[9], [10], [11]] or the kinetic Monte Carlo approaches [8,[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. A large number of questions starting from the nucleation process [20,21], through the morphology of growing discontinuous or semicontinuous films [2,22], to the influence of various material and technological parameters during film growth [7,23], as well as properties of final film structures, was studied experimentally. The reason is that the final micro- and nanostructures are influenced by the growth processes and the ultimate film properties are determined by them. Electrical and optical properties of thin metal (Au, Ag, Cu, Pt, etc.) or semiconductors films are often studied both experimentally and theoretically/computationally [22,24]. There is a close connection between experimental studies and theoretical or computational approaches. Theoretical approaches including computer simulations are necessary to better understand or guide experiments and may allow tuning synthesis parameters in order to achieve better control of film growth. Experimental results, in turn, may be used as inputs to design theoretical models which can be routinely used to plan experiments, thus also allowing for saving time and costs.
The photographs of studied systems from the transmission electron microscopes as well as from AFM or STM microscopes are one of important sources of information about processes in these systems (see e.g. Refs.Â [6,8]). Various information can be obtained during image analysis of the film micrographs: the characterisation of whole images as mean coverage or concentration of objects, the forms and size distributions of individual objects and the distribution of objects on a substrate (in the case of discontinuous films) or the spatial distribution of objects (in composites).
The aim of the paper is to study the initial stages of metal film growth by computer experiment. In our previous papers [18,25] we described an atomistic model combining the molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo approaches. The present study is devoted to the common analysis of computational and experimental data, the analysis being based on techniques of image processing, with the task to discuss the applicability of both the used models and standard morphological techniques in future studies.
