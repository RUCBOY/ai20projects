The proliferation in demand for high-performance electronic systems often comes with inherent thermal challenges. With the thermal challenges for the present and next-generation electronics systems [1], the need to combate excess heat generation has been on the increase. Effective cooling technology or thermal management of microprocessors in most electronic devices including notebook and computers has been one of the key goals in modern-day advanced electronic design. To achieve this goal, active and passive modes of cooling technologies have been deployed. However, the active modes of heat transfer enhancement or augmentation such as fans, blowers, fluid vibration, surface vibration, suction and jet impingement and electrostatic fields have proved economically inviable due to their operating costs. An alternative means of thermal cooling is the applications of passive methods such as extended surfaces and treated surfaces, which have shown to be effective thermal management technology [2]. As one of the passive modes of thermal cooling technology, fin or extended surface are used to enhance the rate of heat transfer from thermal and electronic systems. Although there is a high record of thermal performance of extended surfaces in both electronic and thermal systems [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], the quest for more highly efficient, miniaturized, lightweight heat sink or fin with reduced thermal resistance continues. In search of such high-performance fin heat sink in their investigations, Zhou et al. [17] and Ventola et al. [2] advocated for the use of artificial surface roughness for transfer enhancement through extended surfaces. Consequently, different methods have proposed the application of artificial surface roughness in heat transfer surfaces [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]. However, experimental and theoretical investigations on thermal analysis of artificial rough surface micro-fins with application to microprocessors are limited. Nonetheless, Bahrami [23] presented a study on the effects of random rough surface on thermal performance of micro-fin. Diez et al. [24] applied the power series to analyze the thermal performance of rough micro-fins of three different profiles, namely, hyperbolic, trapezoidal and concave. Recently, several other authors carried out different numerical studies on the enhanced thermal management of microprocessors heat sink using micro-fins with artificial surface roughness and variable thermal properties [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. In most of these works, consideration is placed on the thermal performance in conductive-convective fins, with assumed constant thermal properties. However, such assumption becomes inaccurate with large temperature difference existing between the fin base and its tip. Therefore, this paper presents a numerical study on the thermal analysis and management of microprocessors using cylindrical rough pin micro-fin with variable thermal properties in a convective-radiative environment. The study is carried out to establish the influence of roughness, variable thermal performance, convective, radiative heat transfer on the thermal performance of the micro-fin. In addition, the developed thermal models are solved numerically using Chebychev spectral collocation method (CSCM) and simulated using ode45 in MATLAB.CSCM is an effective numerical approach that solves nonlinear integral and differential equations without linearization, discretization, closure, restrictive assumptions, perturbation, approximations, round-off error and discretization which often results in massive numerical computations. CSCM reduces the complexity of expansion of derivatives and the computational difficulties of the other traditional approximation analytical or perturbation methods. In addition, CSCM provides excellent approximations to the solution of non-linear equations with high accuracy, minimal calculation, and avoidance of physically unrealistic assumptions. It is not affected by computation round-off errors, whilst there is non-requisite for large computer memory and time. CSCM offers fast rate of convergence with a very large converging speed when compared with other numerical methods. The converging speed of the approximated numerical solution to the primitive problem is faster than one expressed by any power-index of N-1. The main advantage of CSCM lies in their accuracy for a given number of unknowns. For smooth problems in simple geometries, they offer exponential rates of convergence/spectral accuracy [30], [31]. Thus CSCM is suitable for the present study for improved thermal management. Furthermore, this study is timely since most electronic/computer devices require efficient, miniaturized cooling system. A key advantage of miniaturized heat sink with fan size is the reduction on the airflow rate and control of acoustic level, which results in lower distortion, an increases the lifespan on the electronic or computer component.The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 we formulate the problem using cylindrical micro-fin with a rough surface. Section 3 presents the mathematical modeling of the rough surface, whilst in Section 4 we apply the CSCM to solve the developed thermal models in Section 3. Section 5 presents the fin efficiency. The results generated using MATLAB is presented and discussed in detailed in Section 6, whilst the paper concludes in Section 7.
