Computers have penetrated all facets of the world (at least the industrialized world) and become inevitable part of our daily lives like home, school, and employment. The devices have advanced over the years tremendously from bulky monitors, huge CPU (central processing unit) and input devices to laptops and now to the all-in-ones with all the computer components integrated behind the monitor panel. All-in-one computers, also called integrated desktops are another style of desktop computer with similar basic functions, but distinctive features in terms of the number and size of the components used (www.lifewire.com/all-in-one-pcs). The All-in-ones save space on and under the desk and avoid the tangle of wires and extra devices like CPU. These also come with wireless keyboards and mouse making it more convenient to boot up and use without plugging in. The all-in-ones have not affected the sales of the laptops much probably be due the portability advantage, but the desktop sales have slid down tremendously in recent years (www.lifewire.com/all-in-one-pcs). The bigger screen size of All-in-ones compared to laptops, touchscreen monitors and their ease in set up increases its ability to be put in kitchen, office, or living room. For these reasons, all-in-one computers are more popular these days than the conventional desktops (www.usatoday.com).
The electronic screen products keep evolving over the years and manufacturers bring in new products to the market. According to the United Nations University (UNU) report the global E-waste has reached 41.8 million in 2014 (https://unu.edu/keyword/e-waste), indicating that more new products are entering the market making the older versions obsolete. The benefits of ICT (information and communication technology) are numerous ranging from telecommunication (media services, voice) to specific applications like banking, education, health care etc. Access to technology and sharing of information is the basic and most important function of ICT which is supported by an all-in-one computer. Considering the kind of advantages ICT products have, its usage is only going to increase in the future with more innovative products. According to census and statistics department of Hong Kong (HK), the overall import percentage of electronic screen products has increased from 35% in 2001 to over 50% in 2010 and continues to increase more rapidly (https://www.censtatd.gov.hk). The kind of innovation, manufacturers like APPLE, HP, Lenovo, DELL and many others have made is tremendous. But all these positive technological advances might have some negative side to it. Risks may be identified both at the production and usage level for electronic screen products. The supply chain of electronic products, specifically computers are often criticized for their negative social implications like forced labor, child labor, excessive working hours etc. These practices are found more in developing countries where poverty and absence of strict legal regulations lead people to take up risky jobs that affect their health and safety. According to the employees working in the plant and the company reports published, labor abuse like harsh working conditions, lethal accidents etc. is quite prevalent in many manufacturing and assembling units and factories (www.nytimes.com). Research conducted in developmental psychology and medical sciences suggests, excessive computer usage results in potential health risks and affects the psychological well-being of the end-users (Subrahmanyam K et al., 2008; Arumugam B et al., 2014). The e-report published by the Department of health of Hong Kong (HK) also reflects potential negative impacts on people's health (https://www.studenthealth.gov.hk).
Social issues and their impacts sometimes are deadly safety problems like explosions killing workers, exposure to toxic chemicals, addictive usage etc. It affects the lives and well-being of the stakeholders involved in the life cycle of an electronic product. This can be termed as the human cost/price that one pays for creating a digital technology. The ICT industry is working to address these concerns. For example, most manufacturers publish their sustainability reports online. Many initiatives are taken by World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) and Global e-Sustainability (GeSI). Many companies have started adapting Electronics Industry Code of Conduct (EICC), Social accountability 8000 and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) (Wang et al., 2017a, Wang et al., 2017b).
For alleviating negative social impacts associated with an electronic product, firstly a thorough analysis of all the life cycle stages that includes quantification and assessment of social impacts is needed. Hence, Social life cycle assessment(SLCA), a life cycle-based method is used in this work. The United Nations Environment Program/Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry (UNEP/SETAC) guidelines is the basic reference used for Social Life Cycle Impact Assessment (SLCIA). The details of the methodology are described in the guidelines (Benoit et al., 2010; Benoit and Mazjin 2009). Further to the publication of the guidelines, many new SLCIA methods were developed and used for assessing social impacts of various product categories based on the guidelines. The wide range of application of SLCA includes: notebooks (Ciroth and Franze, 2011, Ekener-Petersen and Finnveden, 2013; Benoit et al., 2012)), photovoltaic modules (Traverso et al., 2012), PET bottles disposal in Mauritius (Foolmaun and Ramjeeawon, 2012), waste recycling systems (Aparcana and Salhofer, 2013a, Aparcana and Salhofer, 2013b, Umair et al., 2014 and Geyhan et al., 2017), Palm oil diesels (Manik et al., 2013), cooking oil waste (Vinyes et al., 2012), Fertilizers (Martinez Blanc et al., 2014), Building construction Project (Dong and Ng, 2015); IC packaging (Wang et al., 2016a,b), Bamboo cycle frames (Agyekum et al., 2017) and Dairy farms (Revéret et al., 2015, Chen and Holden, 2017).
In this work, a case study on HP All-in-one desktop computer is presented. When we search the Environmental Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA) literature, there are over 50 case studies that focused on laptops and desktops. Within SLCA literature, only three case studies have analyzed a notebook/laptop for its social impacts, previous to this work. This shows a clear insufficiency in the SLCA case studies for this product category. We believe that this work will contribute to case studies on SLCA of electronic screen products, particularly desktops. The present work can be considered as a first attempt for the product category All-in-one PC in terms of assessing social impacts. Also, the SLCIA framework used in this work attempts to overcome the methodology–specific limitations in the previous notebook case studies (Ciroth and Franze, 2011; Benoit et al., 2012 and Ekener Peterson and Finnveden, 2013). The differences between the previous notebook studies and this work are presented below in Table 1.Table 1. Comparison related to the basic approach, methodology and outcome of the four SLCA case studies on computers: Ciroth and Franze, 2011, Benoît et al., 2010, Ekener-Petersen and Finnveden, 2013 and Paper 1(this work).Ciroth and Franze (2011)Benoit et al.

From Table 1, the differences between the previous studies and this work is clearly evident. The major difference is the functional unit of the study and the weighting step within the impact assessment that leads to aggregation of results eventually. Hence, this study takes on a slightly different impact assessment approach that includes characterization, normalization and weighting of social issues according to their topical importance. This will help identify and aggregate potential social risks, in the various life cycle stages of an all-in-computer. The methodology details of the case study are presented in the next section.
