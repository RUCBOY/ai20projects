Polyethylene [abbreviated PE; IUPAC name polyethylene or poly(methylene)] is the most common plastic, its global annual production being around 82 millions of tonnes [1]. Many kinds of PE are known and these generally consist of a mixture of similar polymers of ethylene.
With regards to polymer physics, PE is undoubtedly the most studied polymer. The reasons for this are its chemical simplicity, its high level of production in the last 50 years and the availability of model materials obtained by different synthetic routes (long chain paraffins [2], single-site catalyst PE that include modelling reactions [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] and hydrogenated polybutadienes [22], [23], [24]. In addition, architecture is generally well characterized. This has meant that to a greater or lesser extent, the study of PE in the melt or solution, its solid state structure, morphology or physical properties have been the target of the polymer community for over five decades.
There are many types of PE depending on the polymerization procedure used to generate the polymer, and there are also different classifications based on their density.
However, from a strictly physical point of view, several main factors control the physical properties of PE and these are the focus of interest of this article. In this regard, we recognize that the role of branches is a key factor. In this article, we consider PE as the large family of polymers that have the monomer ethylene (CH2CH2) as their main constituent, and several side branches which can be classified as long or short. Long chain branching (LCB) in PE is used to describe the presence of side branches whose molecular weight (Mw) is above the critical molecular weight between entanglements (Me) but that are not as long as the main chain [25], [26], [27], [28]. By short chain branching (SCB), we understand the presence of side branches of up to 6 carbon atoms (1-octene comonomer), and this is a feature of commercially available PE. In between, we find architectures with branches of Mw below Me. We also consider that branches are randomly placed along the main backbone. In this context, it should be noted that SCB is important for crystallization and solid state properties, while LCB is a determinant of rheological properties with impacts on processing.
As a third point, we should emphasize that several theories of polymers have been applied to PE. Crystal growth theories, crystallographic distortions and mechanical properties are generally applicable but many basic questions still remain unanswered. It should also be considered that the framework of theory describing the molten state and its dynamics is better understood than the solid state properties of PE when compared with model experimental data. Thus, while the selection of experimental results should be filtered according to the complexity of the molecular architecture of the systems, in this paper we have only focussed on experimental results for PE whose molecular architecture has been well characterized.
The points discussed above become important when we try to interpret experimental observations in PE using computer simulation techniques. Here, we review some aspects of computational approaches to PE melt and solid state properties in connection with the available experimental results. Several excellent books and reviews exist on polymer simulations and modelling where the reader can find very valuable information [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38]. The aim of this feature article is to offer our vision of how computer simulations can help in understanding the physics of PE as a model polymer based on our 40 years of experience in the field. The article is organized into four main sections: first we examine the molten state including static and dynamic properties, entanglement features and their effects on rheological properties; next, we discuss the glass transition state, crystallization process and solid state structure, including the interlamellar phase; this is followed by a brief description of the latest advances in the simulation of mechanical properties; and finally we present another brief description, this time of the various methodologies used to simulate the physics of PE.
