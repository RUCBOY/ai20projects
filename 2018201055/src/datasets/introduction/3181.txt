According to the strategy for the development of nuclear power engineering in Russia large-scale nuclear power is planned to be developed on the basis of a closed nuclear fuel cycle (Adamov et al., 2012, Adamov et al., 2015). This development is being implemented under the Breakthrough (or “PRORYV”) project of the Federal targeted program “Nuclear power technologies of a new generation for 2010–2015 and for the future till 2020”. Under the Breakthrough project the BREST-OD-300 and BN-1200 reactor facilities are being designed and it is supposed that one of the technological conceptions created on the basis of these reactor facilities will become the foundation for the future nuclear power engineering in Russia.
One of the important parts of the Breakthrough project is the development of the next generation codes (software) for the design, safety analysis, and justification of NPPs with fast reactors and other elements of a closed nuclear fuel cycle (Bol’shov et al., 2016). Particularly, an universal integrated computer code, EUCLID, for the safety analysis and justification of the new generation NPPs with liquid metal cooled fast reactors under normal operating conditions, design basis accidents and beyond design basis accidents is being developed. The first version of this integrated code, EUCLID/V1 (Avvakumov et al., 2016), designed to analyze normal operating conditions and some of the design basis accidents consists of the following main modules: the HYDRA-IBRAE/LM (thermoHYDRAulics of Liquid Metals) system thermohydraulic module (Alipchenkov et al., 2016), the BERKUT quasi two dimensional fuel rod module (Veshchunov et al., 2015), the DN3D (Dynamic Neutronics 3D) spatial time dependent neutronics module, the BPS (Burning up and Poisoning System) burnup calculation module (Seleznev and Belov, 2013) and the OSTB residual heat calculation module. The prototype of the EUCLID/V1 code was developed in 2012 and in 2013–2016 the verification and validation (V&V) of the EUCLID/V1 code and its modules and further improvements were carried out.
This work is devoted to the description of the BERKUT fuel rod module and the results of its V&V with regard to the simulation of fuel rods of liquid metal cooled fast reactors.
