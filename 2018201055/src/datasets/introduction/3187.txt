Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women [1]. Undoubtedly, the early detection of breast cancer is the most effective way to reduce the death rate [2]. In recent years, since ultrasound has higher sensitivity than mammography in early detection of breast cancer [3] and it is non-invasive, low cost, real time, ultrasound has become one of the most useful modality for detecting and diagnosing the breast tumors. In addition, the developed elastography techniques are mature enough to provide useful information for clinical diagnosis recently. The stiffness differences between benign and malignant tumors may be used to be a basis for classifying tumors in elastography due to the reason that the malignant tumors are usually stiffer than a benign one [4].
The three-dimensional (3-D) US [5] has been developed for clinical assessment of diseases. 3-D US has the real time capability to build the lesion or organ volume by using the computer workstations. The main advantages of 3-D US over 2-D US [6] are to provide a repeatable and more precise method for evaluating disease entities and anatomic structures and to view the cross sectional planes which are usually inaccessible in 2-D US. Recently, research investigators and commercial companies have further developed 3-D elastography to obtain all the elasticity information of a tumor volume. However, elastogram cannot be used for clinical diagnosis without combining other modalities such as 2-D, 3-D or 4-D US [7].
Since the rapid development of hardware and computer applications, many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are developed for saving physiciansâ€™ workloads. Our previous CAD studies are using the 2-D [8], [9] and 3-D US [10], [11], and 2-D elastography [12], [13] to diagnose the tumors. The elastographic features computed from a 3-D elastographic volume rather than using a single elastographic image were utilized to differentiate benign from malignant lesion [12]. It is also proved that the combination of B-mode and elastographic features sufficiently improves the diagnostic performances of 2-D elastography [13]. Similarly, combining 3-D B-mode [10] and 3-D elastographic features may raise the diagnostic rate. Therefore, in this study, a CAD method is proposed based on 3-D morphological and elastographic features extracted from surrounding tumor tissues for classification of benign and malignant breast tumors.
