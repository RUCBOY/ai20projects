The purpose of this work is to reconstruct the internal temperature distribution in an object while the measurements are made outside the object. Such non-invasive, painless measurements of the temperature in deep areas of the human body are essential for some medical applications. The magnetic resonance thermometry enables measurement of internal temperatures of the human body with an error of about 0.4 °C [1]. However, that method requires expensive equipment, skilled personnel and specially prepared premises. Besides, there are groups of people for whom the application of magnetic resonance methods is unacceptable for various reasons. This motivates a demand for alternative, less expensive methods, in particular, active ultrasound thermometry [2], registration of the thermal electromagnetic radiation in the microwave range [3], and passive acoustic thermometry [4]. Each of these methods has its advantages and disadvantages, as well as its own area of application. The present paper deals with the passive acoustic thermometry which can be employed in monitoring local hyperthermia in areas of the human body [5], [6]. The proposed method is based on registering the natural thermal acoustic radiation, in the megahertz range, from the human body [7]. The radiation is caused by the chaotic motion of the atoms and molecules of the matter. To reconstruct an internal temperature in the object, measurements on its surface need to be taken. The following object-scanning methods have been studied theoretically and experimentally: multifrequency probing [8], [9], correlation reception of thermal acoustic radiation [10], [11], [12], [13], scanning of the object by multiple detectors [14], [15], [16]. The method of passive acoustic thermometry provides an accuracy to within 0.5–1 K and a millimeter resolution at a depth of about 5 cm [5], over a time interval of 50 s. Note that some non-medical applications of the method have also been discussed in the literature [17], [18].
This paper presents passive acoustic thermometry on a model object, a slab of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). To reconstruct the time-variable, internal temperature profile, measurements by a single detector were applied. Changes in the temperature distribution were captured every 5.5 s. To solve the problem, the heat equation was used whose parameters were determined in the course of measurements.
