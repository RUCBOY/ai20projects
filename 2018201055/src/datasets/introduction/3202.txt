The emergence of experimental capabilities for material characterization that result in large, multi-dimensional datasets, combined with the increasing capabilities and flexibility of large data analytics, has opened the door for a powerful means of unbiased quantification of the complex interactions between microstructure and mechanical properties. The development of large data frameworks has the potential to significantly improve our ability to predict the effects of processing on material behavior, thereby accelerating the development and deployment of new materials, and increasing confidence in their reliability and performance.
Applications of machine learning and computer vision methods to examine microstructure – property interactions have been thus far limited in number. Recently, visualization tools have been developed for interacting with and exploring large microstructure and metadata datasets to enable image-based microstructural retrieval [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Computer vision and machine learning methods were developed in [3] to characterize powder feedstock materials for metal additive manufacturing, and used to classify the images of eight commercial feedstock powders with greater than 95% accuracy. As addressed by DeCost et al. [3], there are significant advantages of using computer vision and machine learning methods to classify images, including that these approaches are autonomous, objective, and repeatable. In another application, examinations of microstructure-property interactions were pursued through the development of a framework consisting of random data generation, feature selection, and classification algorithms [6].
In this work, deformation twins across mm-scale fields of view were segmented and identified through clustering and computer vision approaches. Deformation twins, which form to accommodate plastic strains incurred upon loading, significantly affect material properties by reorienting the lattice and introducing boundaries that can obstruct slip dislocations and lead to macroscopic hardening [7], [8], [9], [10]. Hexagonal close-packed (HCP) metals such as magnesium tend to form deformation twins when strained, as their crystallography dictates a larger constraint on the available number of slip systems. It is this limited number of independent slip systems that leads to strong deformation textures and reduced formability. Although an understanding of deformation twinning is critical to the mechanistic understanding and accurate predictive modeling of metallic materials, there is much that is unknown about how these twins nucleate and evolve, particularly in relationship to the microstructure. Part of this is due to the need for highly spatially resolved experimental data that captures the evolution of this heterogeneous, sub-grain phenomenon across a statistically significant number of grains.
Diffraction-based studies of magnesium alloys [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] have provided valuable insights into the behavior of deformation twins and their interactions with the microstructure. For example, in-situ neutron diffraction has been used to measure the internal elastic strains and macroscopic textures of polycrystalline samples [11], [12]. It provides statistically averaged information in the grains and twin domains, but lacks the spatial resolution to study the interactions among parent, twinned, and neighborhood regions. In-situ three-dimensional synchrotron X-ray diffraction (3DXRD) has also been used to study twinning, and provides measures of the center-of-mass position, volume, crystallographic orientation, elastic strains, and stress tensors within individual grains [13]; additionally, it can be performed across large numbers of grains [16]. However, the spatial resolution of 3DXRD is also limited, and may not differentiate multiple twins of the same orientation within the same grain. Differential Aperture X-ray Diffraction (DAXM) has higher three-dimensional spatial resolution, but the data acquisition speed is slow and the sample penetration depth is limited to nominally 200 µm [17], [18].
Thus far, the most cost-effective and widely-used method to capture twinning during deformation is based on electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). Efforts have been made to automate the identification of twinning and the parent-twinning relationship, and to generate twinning statistics. In general, scan data points are first grouped into grain fragments and grains based on their orientation. Twinning is identified through different criteria including misorientation, the match of the K1 plane normal, and the match of the twin composition plane trace direction [19], [20], [21]. The identification of the parent-twin relationship has been performed manually [22] and by the use of different voting rules [19], [21], [23]. For example, Wright et al. [19] assumed the dominant orientation in the grain to be the parent, whereas Henrie et al. [23] applied a voting method that considered the major orientation, aspect ratio, number of twin generations, and Schmid factor of grain fragments. Marshall et al. [21] applied an improved voting method by considering the Schmid factor, area ratio, and boundary length ratio of different grain fragments.
There are advantages to identifying twins using diffraction-based methods, including that these approaches are interconnected with the microstructure and therefore do not require alignment, and that there already exist frameworks for automation. The spatial resolution of EBSD is under continuous improvement with efforts in HR-EBSD [24], [25] and new analytical approaches to the captured orientation data such as the dictionary method [26], [27]. Identifying twins from EBSD is also, importantly, a direct measurement of lattice orientation. In contrast, the accuracy of the deformation mapping approach described in this work depends on experimental parameters including patterning quality and choice of correlation algorithm, and one must infer deformation mechanisms from the shape and the magnitude of the captured strain data. The advantage of the approach described herein is that it captures plastic strains, enabling the spatially-resolved investigation of plastic deformation and its evolution in relationship to local and global microstructural characteristics.
