Since Zadeh authored the seminal paper titled “fuzzy sets” (published on Information and Control in 1965), fuzzy theory (FT) has attracted great attention and controversies [30], [44]. FT mainly includes fuzzy set [31], fuzzy logic [70], [82], fuzzy reasoning and fuzzy control [34], [51]. At present, FT is a very popular and well established scientific field [39], [83]. According to incomplete statistics, there are thousands of scholars from different disciplines participating in the research of FT theoretically or practically. The evidence from scholar Google shows that the number of the publications about FT has been well over two million. Many important academic journals focused only on fuzzy researches such as Fuzzy Sets and Systems, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems and Fuzzy Optimization and Decision Making were founded. Furthermore, some previous studies have focused the structures and patterns of the research area based on bibliometric measures. For example, López-Herrera et al. [43] studied the development of FT researches carried out by the Spanish community. Cobo et al. [19] proposed a method to analyze the thematic evolution of a given research field, and as example, they analyzed the FT area.
In the 70s of twentieth century, Chinese scholars began to study FT. Many Chinese scholars have done the massive research works on FT theoretically or practically. In the early 1990s, the founder of the FT, Zadeh had recognized that US, Japan, Europe, and China were the main force of FT researches. The scientific research outcomes from Chinese scholars have obvious influences in the home and abroad. Currently, tens of thousands of publications have appeared on Chinese and international professional journals. In the applications of FT, a lot of practical applications of research results from Chinese scholars have sprung up in the past few decades [73], [84], [89]. For example, Chinese scholars have successfully applied the FT to the weather forecasting [18], [38], earthquake prediction [27], [88], traditional Chinese medicine [21], blast furnace control [37], economics [23], [28], [72], [77], [91] and management [1], [25], [40], [56], [57], [58], [90]. Undisputedly, China has become a significant force in the FT scientific research community.
However, the current status of development about FT researches in China is still unclear, and so are the intellectual structures, research focus as well as emerging trends of FT in China. To fill these gaps, this study applies China's publications indexed in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI), and Arts & Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) (1986–2015) to explore the current status and development trends of China's academic research performances in FT area based on bibliometric analysis methods.
Bibliometrics is the interdisciplinary science of quantitative analysis of all knowledge carriers by mathematical and statistical methods [7]. It is a comprehensive knowledge system which integrates mathematics, statistics and philology as a whole and pays attention to quantitative analysis. At present, more and more attention has been paid to this research. The most obvious advantage is that it allows scholars to investigate the specific research areas by analyzing the citations, co-citations, geographical distribution, and term frequency, thus drawing very useful conclusion [26], [74]. In other words, it is possible to explore the inner publication structure and citation landscape in a research area [78], [79]. At present, it has been widely used in research trend detection [2], author cooperative analysis [47], [53], [86], development of journal [10], [13], development of the whole subject field [45], research topic clustering [22], [54], [55] and so on.
The objective of this paper is to adopt the bibliometric analysis methods to assess the current state and explore the development trends of fuzzy domain in China based on the literature data retrieved from Web of Science. The innovations of our research have three points: First, a large number of publications related to FT in China have been analyzed systematically and scientifically to find out the underlying information. Second, not only the statistical information based on different periods is used to analyze the structures and dynamics of China's FT publications, but also the links analysis and text mining based on social networks are used to explore further features. Third, the developments of China's FT publications are analyzed from different perspectives, which not only include the basic information, such as authors, journals, cited references, and subject category, but also include the research hot spot, international collaboration, and highly cited authors and papers. In addition, our research has some difficulties: On the one hand, the unifications of institutions need to be handled by combining variant institutions’ names, and then the province of each institution needs to be recognized to make further analysis of regional distribution of China's TF research. On the other hand, the disambiguation of Chinese author names needs to be identified based on their full names and affiliations as some authors have same initials, even same full names.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the data source and methodology. Section 3 explores the intellectual structure of China's FT studies from co-authorship and geographical distribution analysis. Section 4 uses citation analysis technique and CiteSpace to visualize the highly cited references, disciplinary distributions, keyword co-word networks, journal co-citation networks and highly cited authors in FT research area from 1986 to 2015.
