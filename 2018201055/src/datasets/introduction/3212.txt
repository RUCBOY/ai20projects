Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare, rapidly progressive and devastating fatal neurodegenerative motor neuron disease affecting mostly older people; the disease is clinically characterized by a combination of lower and upper motor neuron degeneration symptoms, with widespread distribution in bulbar, cervical, thoracic, and lumbosacral regions. It commonly starts with focal onset and spreads inexorably to other anatomical areas [1], leading in a few years to a very severe condition of muscle weakness including limbs, thoracic and bulbar functions.
The disease incidence is about 2 to 3/100,000 in Western countries and prevalence about 4 to 6/100,000 (2). The creation of multidisciplinary ALS centers has greatly improved clinical care in the past decade and enhanced the survival and quality of life of patients.
In 25% to 30% of affected individuals in the early stage of ALS, dysarthria occurs as a first or predominant sign [2]. It affects up to 70% of patients with limb-onset disease, who gradually lose the ability to communicate orally or by writing, as do all patients with bulbar-onset disease when limbs eventually become affected. We have no hard evidence (only grade IV evidence) regarding speech and language management strategies for patients with ALS. The European Federation of the Neurological Societiesâ€“ALS guidelines [3] suggest, as a good practice point, assessing communication every 3 to 6 months and the use of appropriate communication support systems. Various oral communication devices and non-verbal strategies used consist of low-tech and high-tech augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems.
In this study, we investigated the usability of a brain computer interface (BCI) system for typing text for people with ALS. The principle of a BCI is to interpret the electric signals of the brain and translate them into commands. The feasibility of BCI communication has been reported in the past few years for individuals with ALS [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. We evaluated BCI communication in a population of 20 severely disabled patients followed in the ALS Center of Nice University Hospital. The BCI system consisted of a virtual keyboard called the P300 speller [11], [12] equipped with optimal stopping of flashes and word prediction, which are expected to improve performance in terms of information transfer rate (ITR). All patients underwent 2 sessions including 3 operating modes of progressively increasing complexity to investigate the usability of the system in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction as recommended by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO 9241-1998) [13], [14].
