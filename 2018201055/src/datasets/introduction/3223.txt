New dental prosthetic materials are continuously being developed because of progress in computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (CAD/CAM) systems [1], [2]. Various materials such as metals, polymers, and ceramics [3] are used for dental prosthesis manufacturing using CAD/CAM systems. Among these, aesthetically superior glass ceramics, polycrystalline ceramics, and resin composites are the most common. Ceramics have the advantages of high abrasion resistance, aesthetics, excellent color stability, and high biocompatibility; however, they accelerate the abrasion of the opposite tooth and are fragile because of their high degree of brittleness [4]. In contrast, resin composites have the advantages of good aesthetics, an easy cutting process, easy repair in the oral cavity, and they cause less abrasion than do ceramics [5]. However, trace amounts of a toxic substance are released from the resin composites when they are exposed to the oral environment [6]; moreover, the flexural strength, hardness, and elastic modulus of resins are lower than those of ceramics [7].
Hybrid CAD/CAM materials have recently been introduced, and they ameliorate the disadvantages of these two materials [8]. The mechanical properties of these hybrid materials have been studied. The nanoindentation hardness and Young's modulus as measured using a nanoindenter are related to the abrasion resistance and stiffness of the material, respectively, and have been studied in efforts to characterize the inherent characteristics of hybrid CAD/CAM restorations [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The flexural strength of ceramics is particularly important because of their high degree of brittleness [14], [15], [16]. The biaxial flexural strength test is less affected by the edge defects or cracking direction of the specimen than is the uniaxial flexural strength test [17] and is more similar to situations when stress is concentrated on tooth surfaces or dental restorations surfaces in the oral environment [18]. After measuring the strength, analyzing the failure probability using the Weibull distribution can increase understanding of the lifetime of the materials better than considering material strength alone [19], [20]. The Weibull distribution is a generalized exponential distribution that describes the survival and failure times of brittle materials [21]. The surface roughness (Ra) of the restorations in the oral cavity is an important factor affecting patient comfort and bacterial deposition. Ra is the arithmetic mean of the heights at all positions on the surface and is often used as an indicator for surface roughness [22], [23], [24]. In addition, surface analysis can be performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) or energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to observe the fine surface structures and surface compositions, respectively. From these experiments, it has been confirmed that hybrid CAD/CAM materials have aesthetics similar to natural teeth, resistance to discoloration [25], and better machinability than ceramics, which shortens the milling time, prolongs the burr life, and exhibits precise marginal reproducibility [26], [27]. In addition, they can be more easily repaired in the oral cavity than can conventional ceramics [28].
On the other hand, various factors such as mastication, humidity, and temperature in oral environment can affect the mechanical properties and lifespan of dental restorations [29]. Their effects can be predicted using various accelerated aging procedures [18]. Among the accelerated aging procedures performed on existing CAD/CAM materials, hydrothermal treatment using an autoclave or thermal cycling is one of the most commonly used methods [30], [31], [32]. However, research on the mechanical properties of hybrid CAD/CAM material dental restorations intended for long-term use is scarce.
The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical properties of various hybrid CAD/CAM restorations after hydrothermal aging. The first null hypothesis in this study was that the mechanical properties of hybrid CAD/CAM restorations do not differ before and after aging, and the second one hypothesis was that there is no difference among the mechanical properties of the various hybrid CAD/CAM restorations before and after aging.
