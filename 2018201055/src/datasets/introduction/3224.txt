A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that can decode brain activity and translate it into device commands [1]. When combined with various external devices it can be used for communication, control and rehabilitation purposes [2], [3]. Various control signals exist for controlling BCIs such as P300-potentials, visual-evoked potentials, sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) and slow cortical potentials; to produce these requires conscious mental effort. To obtain good control over a BCI, the BCI system must be calibrated correctly thus a large body of work exists for various signal processing techniques that can provide the user with faster responses and more degrees of freedom for control [4], [5]. However, using a BCI is also a new skill that must be mastered which can be obtained through training as reported in several studies [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The effect of subject training has primarily been explored in healthy subjects [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], but also in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [6], [18], [19], [20], [21], spinal cord injury [7], [20], [22], [23], [24] and in stroke patients [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]. The control signals that have been investigated include SMRs, slow cortical potentials, P300 and auditory evoked potentials. Out of those, the SMRs are the most studied control signals in the BCI training literature. Roughly, the training effects that have been reported are in the range of 10–40 percentage points increases in classification accuracy. The duration of the training and number of training sessions vary greatly from five to more than 100 sessions; however, a common observation is that BCI performance is improved with training for control signals that require conscious mental effort (the neurophysiological and neuropsychological aspects, as well as training paradigms are described and reviewed elsewhere [33], [34], [35]).
The improvement in BCI performance is obvious for communication and control purposes, but it has also been shown that improved BCI performance is correlated with the induction of plasticity in a neuromodulatory protocol for rehabilitation [36]. In this protocol, the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) was used as a control signal to detect the intention to perform an imagined movement (or an attempted movement from stroke patients) and in response trigger timely correlated somatosensory feedback from electrical stimulation or robot-assisted movements to induce associative Hebbian plasticity [36], [37], [38], [39]. The MRCP is a brain potential observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) up to 2 s before an executed or imagined voluntary movement [40], [41], [42]. The signal morphology is affected by various factors such as information about the forthcoming/intended movement (level of force and speed), mental effort and fatigue [42], [43]. Therefore, the detection of MRCPs has been explored using various signal processing techniques to provide timely correlated somatosensory feedback in neurorehabilitation protocols targeting motor impairment such as paralysis after stroke [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49]. In this study, it was investigated if subject training could improve the performance of an online MRCP-based BCI that detects movements performed with two levels of speed.
