Building universal quantum computers requires highly developed control technology on physical systems at the quantum level. In recent years, quantum engineering technology, including preparation, manipulation, and detection of quantum systems, is undergoing rapid progress. Quantum computing devices built on a variety of underlying physical implementations are reaching unprecedented level of control and precision in laboratories around the world. Along with this trend, researchers are also making small-sized quantum simulators or processors available to the public by delivering them on the cloud (IBM Q, http://research.ibm.com/ibm-q/; Center for quantum photonics, quantum in the cloud, https://cnotmz.appspot.com/doc). The primary benefit of cloud-based quantum computation is to enable independent parties to validate their ideas or to benchmark quantum operations of interest.
In this new rising field of cloud quantum computing, the superconducting group in IBM has made first steps in 2016 (http://research.ibm.com/ibm-q/). IBM provided the first commercial quantum computing service via a web based interface called IBM Quantum Experience. The underlying quantum hardware is a universal 5-qubit quantum computer based on superconducting transmon qubits. During its one-year service, IBM has provided a unique user experience and shed light on how to successfully maintain a server. In addition, vast amounts of data are obtained, and many of them are scientifically valuable [1], [2].
In this work, we provide online availability of another actual quantum hardware, which is based on a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. NMR spectroscopy is arguably one of the most versatile analytic methods for investigating quantum computation and quantum control [3], [4], [5]. However, an NMR quantum processor (spectrometer), due to its great cost and professional maintenance requirement, is not easy for the public to gain operating experiences. In order to allow for more people, either amateurs or professionals, to embrace and more importantly participate in the tidal wave of quantum science, we launched our NMR quantum cloud computing (NMRCloudQ) service. Through NMRCloudQ, we offer direct access to a real, physical spectrometer in our lab and encourage users to explore quantum phenomena and demonstrate quantum algorithms.
In this paper, we first review some of the most important progresses in NMR quantum computing during the past two decades, and then briefly explain the basics of NMR quantum computing and how to access our cloud service. Finally, we discuss the results and propose potential improvements of NMRCloudQ.
Since the emergence of Shor’s factoring algorithm [6] lit the world’s fervor in pursuing quantum computers more than two decades ago, NMR has always been one of the pioneer platforms to tackle a variety of quantum information tasks, ranging from the development of advanced control techniques [3] to implementation of quantum algorithms [7]. Very soon after the ideas on how to build NMR quantum computers [8], [9], initial attempts towards the implementation of Grover’s search algorithm [10] and Shor’s factoring algorithm [11], and coherent control of up to 7 qubits [12] have been successively realized. Such rapid progress in NMR quantum computing during the early years can be majorly attributed to the mature skills in pulse design and optimization, which are accumulated along the history of NMR spectroscopy.
On the other hand, the new application in quantum computing also brings traditional NMR community new technologies, where we would mention the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) algorithm [13] as a typical example. GRAPE techniques were firstly proposed to achieve high-fidelity controls of individual spins, as well as the entire system dynamics, to satisfy the rigid requirements of a quantum computer. At present, it has been an important pulse engineering approach in NMR spectroscopy, and is also widely used in other quantum computing architectures including election spin resonance [14], nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond [15], [16], superconducting circuits [17], [18], and ion traps [19], [20]. In particular, the control fidelities for single-qubit gates 99.97% and two-qubit gates 99.5% [21] demonstrated via randomized benchmarking in NMR still remain as one of the best in experimental quantum computing to date.
After two decades of the initial idea about NMR quantum computing, we launched the first cloud quantum computing service based on NMR, i.e. NMRCloudQ.
