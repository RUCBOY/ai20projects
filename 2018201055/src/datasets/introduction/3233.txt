Myc is an essential regulator of growth in normal cells, but in many cancers this transcription factor is overactive to support high rates of growth needed for tumor proliferation and progression [1,2]. Myc drives tumorigenesis by transcriptional programming of a large number of target genes that promote cell growth, proliferation, metabolism and apoptosis, and block differentiation [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. Myc is estimated to contribute to most if not all human cancers, including prostate, breast, colon, cervical cancers, small-cell lung carcinomas, neuroblastomas, osteosarcomas, glioblastomas, melanoma, and myeloid leukaemia, most of which are aggressive and respond poorly to the current therapies [1,8,9].
In prostate cancer (PCa), the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men, Myc family members – L-Myc, c-Myc and N-Myc – are implicated in pathogenesis and progression across the full spectrum of PCa, from localized adenocarcinoma to the most advanced and treatment-resistant subtypes – castration-resistant (CRPC) and its neuroendocrine phenotype (NEPC). Amplifications of Myc family members are the most frequently observed genomic alterations associated with specific clinical stages and subtypes of PCa [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. L-Myc is amplified in ∼27% of localized PCa, in a mutually exclusive manner to c-Myc [11], whereas c-Myc is commonly amplified in all PCa stages and subtypes [17]. Notably, c-Myc overexpression antagonizes the transcriptional activity of the androgen receptor (AR), which is a driving force in PCa and constitutes the main drug target for advanced cases of disease [18]. Besides influencing clinically relevant AR target genes, c-Myc upregulation also affects critical splicing programs [19] and increases levels of AR-V7 - the constitutively active ligand-independent AR splice variant that promotes CRPC [20,21] and is also observed in NEPC [14]. Importantly, N-Myc amplifications induce the NEPC phenotype [14,15,22].
To elicit its oncogenic effects, Myc must form a heterodimer with its obligate partner Max, which together bind to the DNA and activate transcription of the target genes [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. Although Myc could qualify as an ideal cancer target, applying conventional structure-based drug design approaches is inherently challenging in drugging Myc. Myc and Max are intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) which exist as dynamic ensembles, with no effective pockets on their surfaces [[27], [28], [29]]. The disordered basic-helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper (bHLHLZ) domain of the Myc monomer forms DNA-binding functionalities only via association with the homologous bHLHLZ domain of Max [23,30]. Only upon such heterodimerization does the resulting Myc-Max complex adopt a stable helical configuration which can bind specific DNA recognition sequences 5′-CACGTG-3′, termed E-boxes, at enhancers and promoters of target genes, and thereby trigger the recruitment of chromatin-remodeling complexes and assembly of the transcriptional machinery to drive the transcriptional program [31,32]. Myc and Max oligomerize through their helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper (LZ) regions and bind DNA mainly through highly positively charged basic (b) region and specific residues located in the HLH region [33,34].
Although Myc inactivation may have undesired effects on normal cells, experimental mouse models of KRAS-driven lung cancer carrying a conditionally inducible Omomyc construct – a Myc dominant negative, 93 residue bHLHZ protein fragment with 4 single-point mutations in the LZ region – established that periodic inhibition is effective at stopping cancer growth with mild and tolerable side effects, suggesting a viable therapeutic strategy [35,36].
Small molecule inhibition of Myc, a therapeutically compelling oncogenic transcription factor, has been a challenge for a long time. Current strategies that directly target Myc in cancer include inhibitors of Myc-Max protein-protein interactions, such as 10058-F4, 10074-G5, and JY-3-094 [37,38], or protein-DNA interactions, such as Mycro3 [39] and KJ-Pyr-9 [40], and inhibitors of Myc expression with G-quadruplex stabilizers, antisense oligonucleotides, and siRNA [41,42]. Indirect approaches have been reviewed elsewhere [41,43,44].
Compounds 10058-F4, 10074-A4, and 10074-G5 are among the first identified direct small molecules Myc inhibitors that bind with mid-micromolar range affinity at 3 independent sites on the disordered bHLHLZ domain of the Myc (c- and N-Myc) monomer (as validated by mutagenesis and NMR experiments) [37,45,46]. The efforts to identify them relied on functional screening of finite libraries unlikely to contain clinically-optimized structures. Attempts to find more potent and selective analogs did not yet succeed given the inconsistent behavior of compounds in in vitro assays [47,48]. Moreover, these compounds lack proper antitumor activity in vivo due to rapid metabolism to inactive metabolites, resulting in low tumoral concentrations insufficient to inhibit Myc-Max dimerization [49,50]. Thus, the quest for discovering effective small molecule inhibitors of Myc is under way and several groups are actively pursuing this research.
