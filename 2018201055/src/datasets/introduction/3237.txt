Pulmonary hamartomas are one of the common causes of solitary pulmonary nodules [1], [2]. They are benign tumors which grow as a disorganized mass and account for 75% of all benign tumors of the lung [3]. They are asymptomatic and do not show any symptom. They are detected accidentally when computed tomography (CT) scan is done for some diagnosis [4]. Hamartomas are made of normal lung tissues including fat, connective tissue, smooth muscle and calcification, which grow abnormally without affecting surrounding tissues [5]. Hamartoma nodules appear like popcorns with fat and calcification [6]. In cases where the nodules contain little fat and no calcification, the radiologists find it difficult to discriminate benign and malignant nodules.
Based on the location of hamartomas in the lung, they are of two types namely peripheral parenchymal type and central endobronchial type. Peripheral parenchymal type hamartomas arising from small bronchi are asymptomatic in nature whereas central endobronchial hamartomas arising from large bronchi are associated with symptoms of obstruction [7].
Hamartoma nodules are small and ranges from 1 to 3Â cm in size. They may grow above this range in certain exceptional cases [5], [6] and sometimes they may be multiple [8]. As they grow in size, the nodules may imitate bronchogenic carcinoma and hence accurate interpretation of imaging and diagnosis is important [9]. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) helps in the diagnosis of hamartoma nodules and differentiates them from other pulmonary nodules [10].
In chest radiographs pulmonary hamartomas are identified as coin lesions [11]. Chest radiographs fail to detect hamartomas when multiple nodules are present and in the absence of calcification and fat [12]. The central lucency caused by adipose tissue may be considered as air within a cavity necessitating differential diagnosis [12]. CT images are superior to chest X-rays and are more sensitive in detecting fat and popcorn-like calcifications. Hamartoma nodules are smooth and appear with sharp margins in CT images. CT scan examination is usually suggested to confirm the disease and its similarity toward other nodules of lung [5]. Li et al. [13] and Awai et al. [14] suggest that a CAD scheme can help the radiologists to make conclusions about the nodules.
In this work, a computer aided diagnosis system to detect the presence of pulmonary hamartomas from lung CT images is proposed. The lung tissues are segmented using a threshold based segmentation approach. Nodules considered as ROIs are extracted from the segmented lung and from which textural, run length and geometrical features are extracted. A filter approach that combines ant colony optimization algorithm is used to select the relevant features. The selected features are used to train support vector machines (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB) classifiers to mark the presence or absence of hamartoma nodules. Cosine similarity measure (CSM) and rough set dependency measure (RDM) direct the ant colony algorithm in feature subset selection. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Literature survey related to the work carried out is presented in Section 2. System framework is explained in Section 3. Section 4 contains experimental results and discussions and Section 5 presents the conclusion and future scope of this work.
