One of the most outstanding achievements of the last decades in the field of production of non-detachable joints is the development of the technology of friction stir welding (FSW) [1]. This technique was patented at the end of 1991 by The Welding Institute UK and found wide application in space and aircraft industry in the middle of the 1990s [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. Recent studies have shown that FSW is a very effective way to obtain high-quality joints for structures of various dimensions and shapes, including sheets, 3D profile structures, and pipes. The main feature of the FSW is the ability to weld the joined materials without melting. The consequence of this is the great number of advantages of FSW in comparison with conventional welding methods like electric arc welding, electron beam, and laser welding. Among these advantages are the absence of hot cracks, melt, and defects caused by solidification of the liquid metal, changes in material properties due to its significant superheating, possibility to join dissimilar alloys and materials (including those that were earlier considered to be impossible to weld by traditional welding methods) [[4], [5], [6]]. More of that, based on the principles of FSW a special surface processing technique (so-called friction stir processing) has been developed and utilized to modify and strengthen the surface of different materials [[7], [8], [9]].
The main problem in the industrial application of FSW technology is associated with the correct choice of technological parameters of the process, such as the tool shape [[10], [11], [12]], penetration depth, rotational speed and longitudinal velocity of the pin, etc. [[4], [5], [6]]. A non-optimal choice of the FSW regimes often reduces the weld quality due to the formation of a large number of different-scale defects in the weld. However, it is unfeasible to define the optimal regime and parameters without a deep insight into the fundamental processes taking place in the material during FSW. Since the early 90s, a lot of experimental and simulation studies of FSW have been performed in order to understand the peculiarities of material flow, heat generation and temperature distribution, material microstructure changes, etc. [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. Unfortunately, the main fundamental problem of FSW, which is the understanding the mechanisms of severe plastic deformation that enable plastic flow, stir and material coalescing behind the rotating and moving pin (i.e. plasticized material behavior in FSW) still remains unclear.
Most of the simulations of FSW are performed using the finite element method [14]. Because the joining materials experience severe plastic flow and stir while the tool is almost rigid, material flow in FSW is usually simulated based on computational fluid mechanics. To take into account the pin deformation and heating the so-called Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian Approach is the most suitable for solving such problems [14,15]. All these methods belong to the continuum concept in mechanics, i.e. they assume that the state controlling variables distribute in space continuously and does account for the material structure. At the same time for describing severe distortion and failure of a material in Lagrangian approach, the most promising are so-called meshless (or mesh-free) methods, namely smoothed particle hydrodynamics [[16], [17], [18], [19]]. To be precise, meshless methods are not pure particle ones. They just use scattered nodes to discretize continuum mechanics equations in space, i.e. they are really based on continuum approach. The principal difference of particle methods from computational methods in continuum mechanics is the replacement of continuous representation of a material by an ensemble of interacting particles. This, in turn, determines the difference in governing equations as well. Thus, partial differential equations of continuum mechanics are replaced by Newton-Euler equations governing the motion of a particles ensemble. Constitutive laws for the considered material in tensor form (which conventionally describe relationships between local stresses and strains or their time derivatives) therewith are replaced by potentials/forces of inter-particle interaction. One of the most important features of particle-based methods is an inherent capability of particles to change their surroundings, i.e. interacting neighbors. This makes discrete element methods [[20], [21], [22]] very attractive for direct simulation of complicated processes of severe deformation including stir taking place in FSW [23,24].
The key point, which determines the mechanical behavior of a discrete elements ensemble, is the structural form of the expressions for interaction forces between elements and the relationship between these expressions and the constitutive law of the modeled material. Usually, pair-wise elastic interaction forces, which can be treated as springs between elements, are used. The spring stiffness is derived on the assumption that strain energy stored in a unit cell of deformed element ensemble is equal to associated strain energy of the equivalently deformed continuum [21,22]. However, an approximation of pair-wise interaction has a number of important limitations, in particular, fundamental problems in the correct simulation of irreversible strain accumulation in ductile materials [25,26].
Previously, we showed that these problems can be solved by using many-particle interaction [25,26]. Such formulation is adopted from the Wiener-Rosenblueth model of cellular automata [27,28] and this hybrid technique is referred to as the movable cellular automaton method [29,30] usually abbreviated as MCA. The main advantage of the generalized expression for interacting forces is the ability of trivial establishing the relationship between vector parameters of the inter-particle interaction and tensor parameters of the material constitutive law. As a result, we can adopt different models and criteria of elasticity, plasticity, and fracture to the formalism of MCA.
This paper is devoted to the theoretical investigation of the peculiarities of material deformation, flow, and stir, as well as heat generation taking place in FSW in order to understand the basic mechanisms of these processes. The investigation was based on computer simulation by the MCA method, which considers a material as an ensemble of bonded particles and allows accounting for the material structure. The breaking of inter-particle bonds and formation of new bonds enables simulation of crack nucleation and healing, as well as material stir and microwelding.
