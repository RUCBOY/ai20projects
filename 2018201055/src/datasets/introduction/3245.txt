We consider non-trivial connected simple graphs only. Such a graph will be denoted by G = (V, E), where V = {v0,v1,⋅⋅⋅, vn − 1} and E are the vertex set and edge set of G, respectively. Let di = d(vi) denote the degree of vertex vi, and Δ = Δ(G) the maximum degree of G. π(G) = (d0,d1,⋅⋅⋅, dn − 1) is called the degree sequence of G. The ABC index of graph G = (V, E) is defined [1] as ABC(G)=∑vivj∈E(di+dj−2)/(didj). For convenience, we call a tree degree sequence is optimal if it is the degree sequence of a tree with minimal ABC index.
The ABC index turned out to be closely correlated with the heat of formation of alkanes [1], and a quantum-chemical explanation for its descriptive ability was provided in [2]. Gutman et al. [3] later confirmed that the ABC index could reproduce the heat of formation with accuracy comparable to that of high-level ab initio and DFT (MP2, B3LYP) quantum chemical calculations. Due to these applications, there is an increased interest in the mathematical properties of the ABC index in the last few years (See [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [31], [32], [33]). However, the problem of characterizing n-vertex tree(s) with minimal ABC index remains open and was coined as the “ABC index conundrum” [23]. In attempts to guess the general structure of n-vertex tree(s) with minimal ABC index, several search algorithms were developed. Furtula et al. [24] carried out a brute-force computer search and found n-vertex tree(s) with minimal ABC index for n ≤ 31. Dimitrov [25] presented a search algorithm based on tree degree sequences, which was tested up to n = 300. Lin et al. [26], [27] improved Dimitrov's algorithm and tested up to n = 400. Recently, by using some recently found structural properties of a tree with minimal ABC index (namely, Lemma 2.2 (1) and (4)), Dimitrov and Milosavljević [30] developed the fastest search program up to date, and tested up to n = 800.
The current search results (n ≤ 800) all support the “modulo 7 conjecture”, which was initially proposed by Gutman and Furtula [12], and modified by Dimitrov [25]. However, this plausible conjecture was shown to be completely false for sufficiently large n by Ahmadi et al. [28]. Hence a much more efficient search algorithm or implementation is desired to identify large trees with minimal ABC index. Obviously, to improve the efficiency of the search algorithm based on tree degree sequences, the key is to refine the features of an optimal tree degree sequence. In the present paper, we significantly refine the results obtained in [26], [27], [30]. With the main result (Theorem 2.10), a search program was implemented with OpenMP. The performance of our program is quite exciting. It identified all n-vertex tree(s) with minimal ABC index up to n = 1100 within 207.1 h on a single PC with 4 CPU cores. As a contrast, on a single PC with one Intel Core i5 CPU @2.3 GHz (2 cores), for n = 800 our program costs 0.22 h only, while the one presented in [30] costs 2.2 h. Moreover, some observations are made based on the search results, which indicate some possible directions in further investigation of the problem of characterizing n-vertex tree(s) with minimal ABC index.
