Recently, metallic glasses (MGs) have attracted substantial investigation because of their scientific significance and engineering applications, such as the excellent strength, large elastic limits, and elastic energy storage [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Due to the novel properties for practical applications, Ni-Hf MGs have been considered as the promising candidate for the structural and functional materials [7], [8], [9]. For instance, the electrical resistivity of Ni-Hf MGs has been revealed to be quite high and change slightly with temperature [8]. Rathnayaka et al. [9] have reported that the Hall coefficient RH of Ni-Hf MGs varies its sign from positive to negative as the Ni concentration increases, and indicated that the Hall resistivity of Ni-rich alloys has a ferromagnetic transition. However, little attention has been paid to study the influence of element additions on the local structure and physical properties of Ni-Hf system. By adding an appropriate amount of Mo contents, Zhang et al. [10] have found that the stabilization of supercooled liquid and glass-formation ability (GFA) of Fe-based MGs were significantly enhanced, and the obtained alloys possess rather high Vicker's hardness and compressive yield strength. In present work, we tend to investigate the metallic glass formation, local structure and mechanical properties of Ni-Hf-Mo system starting at an atomic level.
Nowadays, it is revealed that the local structures of MGs are constituted by different types of short-range-ordered structures (SROs) that are regarded as the principle building blocks of the three-dimensional glass structure [11]. Cheng et al. [12] have performed extensive studies to illustrate the composition dependency of the SROs in Cu-Zr MGs to the mechanical properties. Further studies reveal that the minor element addition to the Cu-Zr MGs can facilitate the development of icosahedral clusters [12], [13], and contribute to higher stiffness and resistant to yield [14], [15]. As a result, developing and understanding the intimate relationship between the local structure and shear deformation behavior of MGs is necessary. Intuitively, the SROs or medium-range-ordered structures (MROs) inevitably break down over long coordination because of the spatial incompatibility, and thus they couldn't fully describe the atomic organization in the disordered materials. Therefore, much effort should be made to explore the higher hierarchy of order, i.e. the structural organization in the spatial network [36], [16]. The description and characterization of the spatial network are of great importance to construct the hierarchical structure of MGs, and further to establish the structure-property relationship.
The atomic structure evolutions underlying the mechanical responses are rather difficult to study experimentally, because of the very short time scales and extremely small length scales [17], [18]. Nevertheless, such spatiotemporal regions are more amenable to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations [19], [20]. In order to perform the MD simulation, we should describe and determine the interaction among all the involved atoms because the accuracy to reproduce the experimental observation is entirely subject to constructed interatomic potential. To begin with, we focus on developing a reliable interatomic potential of Ni-Hf-Mo system, constituted by three metals of different crystalline structures. In addition, a rich set of computer simulations and theoretical analyses were performed to investigate the structural origin of deformation behavior in Ni-Hf-Mo system. The scientific issues proceed as follows: (I) a new long-range n-body potential of Ni-Hf-Mo ternary system was firstly developed; (II) a series of Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were implemented to study the metallic glass formation in the supplementary material; (III) the atomic structural evolution associated with the shear deformation was monitored and characterized; (IV) the distribution of the spatial network were investigated by the connectivity degree.
