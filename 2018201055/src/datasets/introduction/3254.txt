The number of contributors to a mixture that can be detected using current STR analysis kits and analysis methods may be as high as six to eight. Evidence samples containing DNA mixtures with three or more contributors are not uncommon. Given sufficient DNA in a mixture, the number of contributors detected will be limited by the probability of identity of the most discriminating loci of the test group [1]. Analysis of the resulting DNA profiles and elucidation with accompanying probabilities of possible contributor genotypes is difficult or impossible without the use of software designed specifically for that purpose [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. Software used for DNA mixture analysis and comparison incorporates discrete continuous or qualitative continuous methods to model allele drop out. Modeling of other profile variables such as peak height (PH), peak height ratio (PHR), % stutter, DNA degradation and contributor ratio can be incorporated [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]]. Most of these models require the user to assume a specific number of contributors (NOC). This number will usually be based on the maximum allele (MAC) count observed at one or more loci within the profile, where NOC=MAC/2. While this calculation reliably provides the lower bound of the possible NOC, the actual NOC may be higher. Recently other approaches to determining the NOC which incorporate modeling of the profile have been published and shown to provide a significant improvement in the estimate of the NOC [[8], [9], [10]].
While calculation of a likelihood ratio (LR) is the recommended approach for providing a quantitative measure of the weight of the evidence, some laboratories have calculated the probability of a random person being included as a contributor to an observed DNA mixture using the combined probability of inclusion/combined probability of exclusion (CPI/CPE), when DNA results include a known individual as a possible contributor to a mixture based on observation of the known person’s alleles in the mixture [[11], [12], [13]]. Typically, use of this method requires validation and definition of an analytical threshold and a stochastic threshold [14,15]. Appropriate use of the CPI requires that sufficient DNA has been amplified such that all alleles are observed (i.e. there is no allele drop out). The preferred alternative to the CPI is calculation of a likelihood ratio which includes use of a value or modeling of values, for allele drop out [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]].
Two person mixtures where all alleles are present can sometimes be de-convoluted “by hand” depending on the specific genotype combinations present and when the ratio of contributors allows for designation of major and minor contributors. De-convolution may also be possible when the DNA has come from a vaginal swab or other type of intimate sample such that one individual can be assumed to be present and that individuals’ profile is known. In both circumstances allele sharing may still result in some ambiguity. In a two person mixture where all alleles are present, it is possible to visualize the 14 possible combinations of the two genotypes which result in observations of 1, 2, 3 or 4 alleles at each locus and to consider which genotype combinations “make sense”. This process uses/accounts for other profile data such as peak heights, peak height ratios, contributor proportions and other information from the mixture.
Overson and Butler have presented charts showing the genotype combinations which can be found in two and three person mixtures [16,17]. (For three person mixtures see DNA Box 7.2, page 167, and Fig. 7.4, page 168, in Chapter 7 Low-Level DNA and Complex Mixtures from Ref. [18].) Table 1 below gives the number of different combinations of genotypes which produce from 1 to 6 alleles in a three person mixture. The total number of possible combinations is 150. These 150 combinations can be subdivided by the number of alleles observed at a locus and can be further subdivided by “classes” of combinations characterized by the homozygous/heterozygous states of each contributor and the number of alleles and genotypes shared between contributors.Table 1. Distribution of the number of possible combinations of three contributors which will have from one to six alleles at a locus [16,17].Number of alleles observed (L)123456Number of possible genotype combinations [G(L)]1829524515
Considering that a locus can have anywhere between 1 and 6 alleles, deciphering the genotypes of the three contributors requires unraveling which of the possible combinations of genotypes for the number of alleles observed, is actually present for each locus. Thinking about the possibility of doing this should quash any thoughts that the contributor genotypes can be deduced by hand even when considering the observed peak heights. The number of possible genotype combinations G(L) that exist in mixtures having more than three persons has not been calculated but will be greater than 150. In this paper we derive a method for computing the number of possible allocations of genotypes among N contributors of the genotypes derived from a set of alleles at a single locus. We present a definition of “class” that allows separation of the genotype combinations having a given total number of alleles (L) into classes which are consistent with those shown by Overson and Butler. The definition is expandable to any number of contributors. While knowing the number of possible genotype combinations that would account for the presence of, e.g. 1 to 8 alleles at each locus of a four person mixture, does not contribute to solving the problem of determining the likely genotypes of the four contributors, it illustrates the magnitude of difficulty of the problem. This information also illustrates why including an individual solely because his/her alleles are present is hazardous.
