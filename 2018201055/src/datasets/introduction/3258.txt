One of the simplest models [12], [15] for a suspension bridge is the partial differential equation (PDE)(1.1)∂2U∂T2=−∂4U∂X4−eU+1. Here U(T,X) describes the deflection of the roadway from the rest state U=0 as a function of time T and the spatial variable X (in the direction of traffic). This paper is concerned with traveling wave solutions of (1.1), i.e., solutions U(T,X)=u(X−cT) describing a disturbance with profile u propagating at velocity c along the surface of the bridge. In particular, we apply a computer-assisted proof method to show that there is a large range of velocities for which such a solitary wave exists.
Looking for traveling waves of (1.1) with wave speed c leads to the ordinary differential equation(1.2)u⁗+c2u″+eu−1=0. For large positive and negative values of the independent variable t=X−cT we assume the solution to converge to the equilibrium u=0. Due to the reversibility symmetry of the PDE in both time and space, we may restrict our attention to symmetric solutions. Hence, setting β=c2, we are looking for symmetric homoclinic orbits satisfying(1.3){u⁗+βu″+eu−1=0u(−t)=u(t)limt→∞⁡u(t)=0.
Fourth order differential equations of the form u⁗+βu″+f(u)=0 for various nonlinearities f have been studied extensively. For the bistable nonlinearity f(u)=u3−u the equation is a standard model in pattern formation, called the Swift-Hohenberg equation (see [18] and references therein), whereas the quadratic nonlinearity f(u)=u2−u appears, for example, in the study of water waves [4]. For the piecewise linear case f(u)=max⁡{u,0} homoclinic solutions were obtained in [8], [15]. For the problem with the exponential nonlinearity f(u)=eu−1 a family of periodic solutions was established in [17].
In [8] the question about existence of a symmetric homoclinic orbit of (1.3) is raised. This question was addressed by variational methods in [21], where the authors proved the result for almost all parameter values β∈(0,2). In [20] the existence of homoclinic orbits was demonstrated for all β∈(0,c⁎2)≈(0,0.5516), again using variational methods as well as intricate estimates on the second variation. In a different direction, using a computer-assisted proof, it was proven in [3] that (1.3) has at least 36 homoclinic solutions for the single parameter value β=1.69.
In the present paper we complement the above results by proving the following. Theorem 1For all parameter values β∈[0.5,1.9] there exists a symmetric homoclinic orbit of (1.3).
We remark that for |β|<2 the origin is a saddle-focus, while for β>2 it is a saddle-center. Furthermore, we note the integral identity ∫R|u″|2−β|u′|2=−∫R(eu−1)u. Since the right hand side is non-positive, homoclinic orbits are excluded for β≤0. It is thus expected that the parameter range for which homoclinics exist is β∈(0,2), or, equivalently, wave speeds c∈(0,2). Our method for proving the result in Theorem 1 is computer-assisted. While it can certainly be extended somewhat beyond the interval [0.5,1.9], it is not possible to cover the entire range (0,2) in this way. Indeed, as β decreases towards 0 the amplitude of the solution diverges (u becomes very negative), whereas when β tends to 2 the homoclinic orbit collapses onto the trivial solution. In both limit regimes computer-assisted proofs become harder and harder. Since the result in [20] already covers the range β∈(0,0.55], we thus focus on the parameter range [0.5,1.9]. We note that at β=2 a Hamiltonian–Hopf bifurcation occurs. In future work we intend to unfold this bifurcation and subsequently connect the homoclinic orbit that bifurcates to the branch covered by Theorem 1 (at that point we will know how far we have to push the current continuation technique beyond β=1.9 to connect all the way to the bifurcation point).
The rest of the paper is dedicated to the proof of Theorem 1. Our approach begins by rewriting (1.3) as a first order system for (u1,u2,u3,u4)=(u,u′,u″,u‴) and then making the change of variables (v1,v2,v3,v4)=(eu1−1,u2,u3,u4) to obtain(1.4){v1′=v2+v1v2v2′=v3v3′=v4v4′=−βv3−v1. There are two reasons for performing this change of variables. First, it turns the system into a polynomial vector field, which has technical advantages when performing the analysis to derive the necessary bounds. Second, while u1 may become very negative for small values of β, the variable v1 is always bounded from below by −1. Our goal is now to prove the existence of symmetric homoclinic solutions to (1.4) for all β∈[0.5,1.9].
We split the problem into two parts. On the one hand a rigorous computational description of the local (un)stable manifold is required. On the other hand we need to solve, via a rigorous computational technique, a boundary value problem for the part of the orbit between the local invariant manifolds. We attack both parts by a continuation technique in the context of the radii polynomial approach. This parametrized Newton–Kantorovich method, adapted to a computational setting, is introduced in Section 2. In Section 3 we combine this with the parameterization method to obtain descriptions of the local (un)stable manifold of the equilibrium 0∈R4. Essentially the same technique is then applied in Section 4 in a Chebyshev series setting to solve the boundary value problem. These two aspects are then combined into a rigorous computational continuation of the homoclinic solution to (1.3). We note that for smaller values of β the boundary value problem is the more difficult part of the problem, as the orbit makes a bigger and bigger excursion away from the origin. On the other hand, for values of β close to 2 it is more difficult to obtain the local (un)stable manifold of the origin, as the real part of the eigenvalues tends to 0. The algorithmic issues encountered when implementing the proof of Theorem 1 are discussed in Section 5.
Finally, let us mention that there is a growing literature on the subject of computer-assisted methods for proving existence of connecting orbits, see [22], [24], [26], [29], [30], [31], [32]. The main novel contribution of the current paper is to do rigorous continuation of a homoclinic orbit over a large range of parameter values. The method is generally applicable for connecting orbits problems in parameter dependent problems. In that sense Theorem 1, while providing a new result for traveling waves in the suspension bridge problem which complements earlier work, is an illustration.
