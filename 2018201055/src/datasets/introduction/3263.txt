Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has been widely used in external beam radiation therapy at several anatomical sites. Volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) is also gaining popularity because of its rapid delivery of highly conformal dose distributions. This is accomplished using complex modulation of the beam intensity of each field [1].
Some reports have described adverse dose-delivery events for both simple and complex treatment plans [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. An incident that occurred in 2005 involved IMRT treatment using dynamic motion of a multileaf collimator (MLC) [7]. Most reported incidents may have been avoided if pretreatment measurement verification had been conducted, such as that using ionization chambers, film, and online two- or three-dimensional detectors [8]. A departmental process for measurement verification is therefore recommended for complex treatment plans. Independent dose calculation is also useful for secondary plan checks. Clarkson-based dose calculation is a conventional method of independent dose calculation [9] and is still commonly used worldwide. Independent dose calculation is generally performed for conventional treatment plans generated by an on-site radiotherapy treatment planning system (TPS) as a secondary check. Actual dose measurements are common for IMRT/VMAT, although they may be time-consuming and labor-intensive [10], [11]. IMRT/VMAT has also been used in palliative radiotherapy such as for whole-brain radiotherapy with hippocampal avoidance, multiple brain metastases, and spine metastasis [12], [13], [14], in which the time between planning computed tomography (CT) acquisition and the first treatment fraction is as short as possible. Thus, efficiency is an important factor of IMRT/VMAT quality assurance (QA). The number of IMRT/VMAT procedures performed is likely to continue increasing, and dose measurements may begin to obstruct the clinical workflow.
Independent dose calculation may provide simple and efficient QA by using patients’ CT image data to verify the dose inside the patient’s body before treatment. Sun et al. [15] reported that an independent dose calculation-based method can be performed in an average of 32 min, which is much more efficient than the measurement-based QA approach. Recent studies have shown that independent dose calculation can now be performed using the trajectory log files, an approach that includes the expected and actual information on MLC location, gantry position, and monitor unit (MUs). This phantom-less QA approach allows the possibility of checking the prescription dose or dose distribution in the patient’s body accompanied by verification of deliverability [16], [17]. However, only a few verification programs are able to take the log files into account when estimating deliverability. Therefore, independent dose calculation using a patient’s CT image data without the log files is still a more effective QA tool for IMRT/VMAT when accompanied by measurement verification of the safety of deliverability.
The number of commercially available verification programs using the Clarkson method for the IMRT/VMAT dose is increasing [18], [19], [20], and they are now entering clinical use. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine Task Group 114 (AAPM TG-114) has recommended that the disagreement between the primary TPS and secondary verification program should not exceed ±5% [21]. However, this does not cover IMRT/VMAT. Several published studies have demonstrated that ±5% is a reasonable limit using in-house verification programs for IMRT [22], [23], [24]. Additionally, in other studies, dose calculation was performed with a commercial verification program for IMRT/VMAT [2], [25], [26], and comparisons were made between the TPS and the verification program using homogeneous phantoms. Sun et al. [15] stated that such a phantom measurement verification would not be able to account for tissue inhomogeneities in patients. Kuppusamy et al. [27] performed a study comparing an in-house program with a commercial verification program that took heterogeneity corrections for VMAT into account. In their report, they concluded that a commercial verification program using a modified Clarkson method can be used for independent dose calculation of VMAT plans with isocenters above −350 HU. However, each of these studies was performed in a single institution.
No multi-institutional studies of independent dose calculation have addressed the discrepancies between TPS doses and program-calculated doses for IMRT/VMAT. Multi-institutional studies have recently been conducted to evaluate the dosimetric consistency among different institutions and to identify problems [28], [29]. Moreover, a multi-institutional study would be helpful to determine the departmental action levels of independent dose calculation because the results would incorporate different patient characteristics, different treatment planning techniques, different dose–volume constraints, and different physical settings for the MLC, allowing consensus values for action levels to be derived [30].
In the present study, we performed the first multi-institutional comparisons of independent dose calculation verification in IMRT/VMAT and evaluated the discrepancies between the TPS doses and the program-calculated doses. We investigated whether ±5% is an achievable action level for local dose discrepancies at a point within the planning target volume (PTV) (above −350 HU) for independent dose calculation with heterogeneity corrections for IMRT/VMAT across multiple institutions. We employed a commercial verification program using a modified Clarkson method to calculate doses for inhomogeneous tissues according to patient CT images. First, on-site TPS doses and verification program-calculated doses incorporating information from patients’ CT image data were compared in an anatomic region as recommended by Kuppusamy et al. [27]. Additionally, the measured dose and the TPS-calculated dose were compared at each institution to evaluate the accuracy of the TPS before the multi-institutional study.
