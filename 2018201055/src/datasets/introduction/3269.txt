An independent set of a graph G with vertex set V is a subset I of V, such that each pair of vertices in I is not adjacent in G. A maximal independent set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. A largest maximal independent set is called a maximum independent set (MIS). In other words, a MIS is an independent set that has the largest size or cardinality. The cardinality of a MIS is referred to as the independence number of graph G. A graph G is called a unique independence graph if it has a unique MIS [1]. The MIS problem has a close connection with many other fundamental graph problems [2], [3], [4]. For instance, the MIS problem in a graph is equivalent to the minimum vertex cover problem [5] in the same graph, as well as the maximum clique problem in its complement graph [6]. In addition, the MIS problem is also closely related to graph coloring, maximum common induced subgraphs, and maximum common edge subgraphs [7].
In addition to its intrinsic theoretical interest, the MIS problem has found important applications in a large variety of areas, such as coding theory [8], collusion detection in voting pools [9], scheduling in wireless networks [10]. For example, it was shown in [8] that the problem of finding the largest error correcting codes can be reduced to the MIS problem on a graph. In [9] the problem of collusion detection was framed as identifying maximum independent sets. Moreover, finding a maximal weighted independent set in a wireless network is connected with the problem of organizing the vertices of the network in a hierarchical way [11]. Finally, the MIS problem also has numerous applications in mining of graph data [7], [12].
In view of the theoretical and practical relevance, in the past decades the MIS problem has received much attention from different disciplines, e.g., theoretical computer science [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] and discrete mathematics [19], [20], [21]. It is well-known that solving the MIS problem of a generic graph is computationally difficult. Finding a MIS of a graph is a classic NP-hard problem [2], [4], while enumerating all MISs in a graph is even #P-complete [22], [23]. Due to the hardness of the MIS problem, exact algorithms for finding a MIS in a general graph take exponential time [24], [25], [26], which is infeasible for moderately sized graphs. For practical applications, many local or heuristic algorithms were proposed to solve the MIS problem for those massive and intractable graphs [27], [28], [29].
Comprehensive empirical study [30] has unveiled that large real networks are typically scale-free [31], with their vertex degree following a power-law distribution P(k)∼k−γ. This nontrivial heterogeneous structure has a strong effect on various topological and combinatorial aspects of a graph, such as average distances [32], maximum matchings [33], [34], and dominating sets [35], [36], [37]. Although there have been concerted efforts to understanding the MIS problem in general, there has been significantly less work focused on the MIS problem for power-law graphs [38]. In particular, exact result about the independence number and the number of all MISs in a power-law graph is still lacking, despite the fact that exact result is helpful for testing heuristic algorithms. Moreover, the influence of scale-free behavior on the MIS problem is not well understood, although it is suggested to play an important role in the MIS problem.
The ubiquity of power-law phenomenon makes it interesting to uncover the dependence of MISs on the scale-free feature, which is helpful for understanding the applications of MIS problem. In this paper, we study the independence number and the number of maximum independent sets in a scale-free graph, called pseudofractal scale-free web [39], [40], and the Sierpiński gasket. Both networks are deterministic and have the same number of vertices and edges. Note that since determining the independence number and counting all maximum independent sets in a general graph are formidable, we choose these two exactly tractable graphs. This is a fundamental route of research for NP-hard and #P-complete problems. For example, Lovász [41] pointed out that it is of great interest to find specific graphs for which the matching problem can be exactly solved, since the problem in general graphs is NP-hard.
By using an analytic technique based on a decimation procedure [42], we find the exact independence number and the number of all possible maximum independent sets for both studied graphs. The independence number of the pseudofractal scale-free web is as twice as the one associated with the Sierpiński gasket. In addition to this difference, there is a unique maximum independent set in the pseudofractal scale-free web, while the number of all maximum independent sets in the Sierpiński gasket increases as an exponential function of the number of vertices.
