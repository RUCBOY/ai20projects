n-Hexane as a broad-spectrum petrochemical product is widely used in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and food industry. Generally, it is produced from raffinate oils composed of C6 alkane mixtures (e.g., 6# solvent oil), where the separation of n-hexane (boiling point 341.88 K) and methylcyclopentane (boiling point 344.96 K) represents one of the most challenging tasks. Currently, the n-hexane-methylcyclopentane separation is mainly achieved by distillation, molecular sieve adsorption or extractive distillation. However, due to their very close boiling points, distillation is very energy- and cost-intensive, and even unrealistic to obtain high purity products. Molecular sieve adsorption suffers from poor capacity and difficulties in regeneration of adsorbent. Compared to the above methods, extractive distillation is an energy- and cost-efficient option because of the enhanced relative volatility of n-hexane to methylcyclopentane in the presence of an additional solvent (namely entrainer or separating agent) [1], [2], [3], [4]. Moreover, the product purity can be adjusted through different solvent to feed ratios. Therefore, extractive distillation is widely regarded as the most promising technique for the separation of n-hexane-methylcyclopentane mixture and other close-boiling hydrocarbon mixtures in petrochemical engineering.
The technical and economic feasibility of a specific extractive distillation process strongly relies on the selection of a suitable entrainer. So far, several conventional organic solvents, e.g., dibutylphthalate (DBP), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) have been tested as the entrainer for n-hexane-methylcyclopentane separation. However, for such extractive distillation processes, several disadvantages still exist as follows: (a) These organic solvents may bring about consequent safety and environmental problems because of their toxicity, flammability, and volatility. (b) Poor capacity and selectivity lead to either a large number of column stages or high solvent demand. (c) Due to the presence of entrainer at the top and/or bottom of the extraction column, complex regeneration units are also required in these processes. Taking into account of all these disadvantages, the selection of more effective and environmental-friendly alternatives to these organic solvents are highly desirable.
In the past decade, ionic liquids (ILs) have attracted significant attention of chemical engineering community due to their unique physical and chemical properties, such as non-volatility, non-flammability, high thermal/chemical stability, wide liquid range, and so on [5], [6]. More importantly, the properties of ILs can be fine-tuned by judicious combination of cation, anion, and substitution groups, which make them particularly promising entrainers for extractive distillation. In the early 2000s, Lei et al. proposed the technology of extractive distillation with ILs and reported the VLE data of ternary systems (cyclohexane + toluene + [BMIm][BF4], ([BMIm][PF6], and [BMIm][AlCl4]) for the first time [1]. Since then, numerous studies on IL-based extractive distillation for polar-polar (e.g., alcohol-water, alcohol-ester), polar-nonpolar (e.g., alcohol-aliphatic hydrocarbon) and nonpolar-nonpolar systems (e.g., alkane-alkene, aliphatic-aromatic hydrocarbon) have been carried out [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. However, reports on the separation of alkane-cycloalkane, such as the highlighted n-hexane-methylcyclopentane, using extractive distillation, are rarely available by far.
For IL-based extractive distillation, the separation performance of ILs largely depends on their cation and anion structures [13], [14], [15]. Moreover, suitable IL entrainers also vary greatly from system to system. That is to say, it is very crucial to select proper ILs according to the characteristics of different systems. Most studies of IL selection strongly depend on laboratory experiments. However, considering the huge number of possible cation-anion combinations, such experimental approach is time-consuming, expensive, and in most cases unrealistic to obtain the optimal solvent. Therefore, in this respect, efficient and reliable theoretical methods for IL screening or design are of great significance [16].
Ab initio methods, the classical activity coefficient models (e.g., NRTL, UNIQUAC) and equation-of-state methods have been used to investigate the thermodynamic properties of IL-involved systems. However, these methods require either expensive computational cost or a number of molecule-specific parameters regressed from experimental data, making them unsuitable for extensive screening of ILs from a large number of potential candidates. The COSMO-RS model developed by Klamt et al. is a novel alternative for calculating thermodynamic properties of pure-component liquids and liquid mixtures, including IL systems [17], [18]. It is fully predictive since it only requires the screening charge density distributions (σ-profiles) of involved compounds, which can be obtained by standard quantum chemical calculations. For this reason, the COSMO-RS method has been widely applied to guide IL selection for various separation applications, e.g., separation of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, extractive desulfurization and CO2 capture, etc. [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Nevertheless, there still exists large space for development of current σ-profile database and improvement in the quantitative accuracy of the COSMO-RS model [24].
In recent years, several research groups have extended UNIFAC models to IL systems, among which Lei et al. reported the completest one by far (covering 49 IL main groups and 19 conventional main groups) [25], [26], [27]. Since the group binary interaction parameters are determined by fitting experimental data, the quantitative prediction performance of the UNIFAC-IL models can always be ensured [28], [29]. The group contribution (GC) character of the UNIFAC-IL enables them to be easily incorporated into a computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) framework for IL design [10], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. Moreover, the computation speed of the UNIFAC-IL model is very quick and the model parameters can be readily input into process simulators (e.g., Aspen Plus and PRO-II) for further process design and optimization. Consequently, CAMD of ILs based on UNIFAC-IL is very promising for the accurate identification of suitable ILs for separation tasks. So far, a number of reports on UNIFAC-IL based CAMD of ILs have been published. These studies are mainly restricted to alcohol-water extractive distillation, aromatic-aliphatic extraction and CO2 capture processes. Very few of them have taken the advantages of UNIFAC-IL for process evaluation to directly identify optimal entrainer from process point of view [11], [27], [28], [29]. To the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of report on the CAMD of ILs for alkane-cycloalkane separation.
In this contribution, a systematic study integrating CAMD and process evaluation is presented to identify suitable ILs for n-hexane-methylcyclopentane extractive distillation. The whole paper is organized as follows: Section 2 preliminarily validates the employed UNIFAC-IL model for CAMD and process simulation. Section 3 formulates the mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem for CAMD and pre-identifies a list of potential IL candidates for n-hexane-methylcyclopentane separation. Section 4 compares the performances of the top IL candidates in n-hexane-methylcyclopentane extractive distillation process to identify the process-based optimal entrainer. Section 5 briefly summarizes this work.
