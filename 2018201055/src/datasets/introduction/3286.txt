Water contamination is one of the most serious environmental issues, as many hazardous micropollutants, such as heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, dyes, fertilizers, and pesticides are increasingly being released into the watercourses [[1], [2], [3]]. Since these pollutants present high toxicities and thus constitute a threat to fauna and flora, it is essential to develop efficient techniques for water decontamination [4,5].
Semiconductor-based heterogeneous photocatalysis is one of the most promising processes for the treatment of contaminated water. Among the available catalysts, titanium dioxide (TiO2) presents the most suitable properties: it is chemically and biologically inert, stable, non-toxic, cheap and easy to produce [6,7]. However, it has an energy band gap (3.2 eV for the anatase phase and 3.0 eV for the rutile phase) with photoexcitation in the ultraviolet (UV) range. This translates to a reduced spectral activation with natural light since UV radiation corresponds to just 5% of the solar spectrum.4 Further, the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs is high, which results in reduced photocatalytic efficiency [4,8].
Several strategies have been attempted to tailor TiO2's band gap and to reduce the electron-hole recombination to overcome these limitations, namely doping TiO2 with metallic [9], no-metallic [10], and rare earth elements [4], and mixing TiO2 with other nanomaterials [8]. One particularly promising approach lies on the mixing with graphene (G) and graphene oxide (GO) to develop TiO2 nanocomposites (designated by TiO2/G and TiO2/GO, respectively), as these composite materials have been found to present improved electronic and optical properties for photocatalysis.
TiO2/G and TiO2/GO nanocomposites have been produced by solvothermal [11], hydrothermal [12,13] and one-step colloidal blending [14] methods. These nanocomposites have been assessed for the degradation of pollutants, namely: methylene blue (under UV and visible-light irradiation) [12,14], risperidone (using artificial sunlight and visible radiation) [13], naphthenic acids [11] methyl orange and dimethyl phthalate [15] (both under UV irradiation). In these studies, high photocatalytic efficiency was found which was attributed to increasing adsorption of the pollutants onto the nanoparticles surface and to increased separation of charge carriers, which effectively inhibits recombination. Computationally, DFT studies regarding the electronic properties of TiO2/G interfaces have been reported addressing the interfaces of TiO2 surfaces/slabs for the anatase [16,17] and rutile crystal phases [18] with one graphene adlayer. In all these studies, it was found that these interfaces show a reduced band gap and at the same time promote separation of charge carriers at the interfaces.
Few of the reported works to date relate the photocatalytic efficiency with the G/GO concentration, and none of them compares the performance of the TiO2/G with the performance of the TiO2/GO nanocomposites. Further, although the properties of TiO2/G interfaces have been computationally calculated previously, the properties of TiO2/GO interfaces are yet to be determined.
Therefore, the present work comprises a complementary computational and experimental investigation of the photocatalytic activity of TiO2/G and TiO2/GO nanocomposites with different contents of graphene and GO. These nanocomposites were used to degrade a dye (methylene blue - MB) and an antibiotic (ciprofloxacin – CIP), under UV and visible-light irradiation, to evaluate and compare their photocatalytic performance. Moreover, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first study that uses these nanocomposites to degrade antibiotics, even though these represent a serious concern to the environment due to their toxicity and the increased risk of new antibiotic-resistant microorganisms [3]. Also, the fundamental electronic properties of TiO2/G and TiO2/GO interfaces were also computed through density functional tight-binding method to rationalize the results.
