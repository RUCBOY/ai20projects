High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is a technique used to separate and purify the individual components of a complex mixture [1]. The continuing improvements in liquid chromatography technology have led to many new and fascinating applications in engineering, chemistry, biology and medicine, etc. [[2], [3], [4], [5]]. Typically, the column dimensions are 2.1–4.6 mm in diameter, 30–250 mm in length, and are consisted of smaller sorbent particles (silica gel, mesoporous materials, high molecular polymers). The mobile phase is a mixture containing solvents (such as acetonitrile, methanol, n-hexane) and molecules to be separated. The column contains sorbent particles and is referred as stationary phase. In the separation process, the mobile phase carried the mixture through the stationary phase. The components in the mixture are separated from each other according to different degrees of interaction with sorbent particles. In usual, the compositions and temperature play a key role in the separation process by influencing the interactions between sample components and sorbent. These typical interactions are hydrophobicity, dipole-dipole interactions and electrostatic interactions.
The application of technology in liquid chromatography still has increasing interest in recent years as it processes high accuracy, high sensitivity and fast detection time [[6], [7], [8]]. However, the HPLC still has a main problem. Some of fundamental mechanisms on chromatographic retention processes remain unclear. Recently, some theoretical studies of chemical separation, using molecular simulation (MD), have been reported. It appears useful to simulate the separation at molecular level and understand the flow and diffusion mechanisms [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. Their simulated results are consistent with HPLC and IR results. However, it has fundamental difficulty of the time scale involved in the separation. The scale of molecular-level simulation is too small comparing to the real macroscopic process. Wang's report showed the diffusion and sorption behavior of solution to support the experimental results [9]. But it's a relatively static states, in our study the small force along X-axis was been used at solution's molecules to simulate the mobile phase through by the stationary phase. In usual MD simulation, the box length is about few hundred angstroms, but the real column length is in few tenth of milimeters.
In this article, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate the separation of explosive molecules by HPLC column filled with polymeric molecules: Poly-1,2-methylenedioxy-4-propenyl benzene (PISAF) and polymeric-molecular siloxanes compound (SiC8). The waste of explosive molecules can cause contamination problem or the earth. C. L. Lee et al. have reported these polymeric molecules in the stationary phase of HPLC can effectively separate explosive compounds [20]. Fig. 1 was the formulas of PISAF polymer and SiC8. Some studies reported their quantum mechanical calculations about the hydrogen bonding, Van der Waals interactions, bound energy, and coulomb attraction energy between various polymeric molecules (poly-1,2-methylenedioxy- 4-propenyl benzene, PISAF; polydimethyl-siloxane, PDMS; and polyethylene glycol, PEG). This study indicates these polymeric materials can help to separate the explosive compounds [21,22]. Experimental works of HPLC indicates that PISAF column is more efficient than SiC8 to separate explosive molecules.Download : Download high-res image (162KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

In our simulation, we try to extend the column length of separation to thousand angstroms. Although it is still too short comparing to the real column length, however, our simulation showed the clear separation phenomenon of the objects.
