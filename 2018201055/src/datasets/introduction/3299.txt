Many real-world networks can conveniently be modelled by graphs or networks. Examples include a railroad network with nodes presenting railroad stations and links corresponding to railways between two stations, or a communication network with nodes presenting cities, and links presenting communication channels. In particular, a wide variety of systems can be described using complex networks. Such systems include: the World Wide Web, which is a virtual network of Web pages connected by hyperlinks; the cell, where we model the chemicals by nodes and their interactions by edges; and the food chain webs, the networks by which human diseases spread, human collaboration networks etc [1]. Factors and orthogonal factorizations in networks or graphs have attracted a great deal of attention [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10] due to their applications in network design, circuit layout, combinatorial design, and so on. For example, a Room square of order 2n is related to the orthogonal 1-factorization of a complete graph K2n, which was first posed by Horton [12]. Euler [11] first found that a pair of orthogonal Latin squares of order n is equivalent to two orthogonal 1-factorizations of a complete bipartite graph Kn, n. Many other applications in this field can be found in a current survey [13]. It is well known that a network can be represented by a graph. Nodes of the network correspond to vertices of the graph, and links between the nodes in the network correspond to edges of the graph. Henceforth we use the term graph instead of network.
The graphs considered in this paper will be finite undirected graphs which neither loops nor multiple edges. Let G=(V(G),E(G)) be a graph, where V(G) and E(G) denote the vertex set and edge set of G respectively. For arbitrary x ∈ V(G), the degree of x in G is defined as the number of edges which are adjacent to x and denoted by dG(x). Let g, f: V(G) → Z be two functions such that f(x) ≥ g(x) ≥ 0 for each x ∈ V(G). A spanning subgraph F of G with g(x) ≤ dF(x) ≤ f(x) for arbitrary x ∈ V(G) is defined as a (g, f)-factor of G. Especially, G is defined as a (g, f)-graph if G itself is a (g, f)-factor. A (g, f)-factorization F={F1,F2,…,Fm} of G is a partition of E(G) into edge-disjoint (g, f)-factors F1,F2,…,Fm. A subgraph H of a graph G is said to be an m-subgraph if H admits m edges in total. For a (g, f)-factorization F={F1,F2,…,Fm} of G and an mr-subgraph H of G, F is said to be r-orthogonal to H if |E(H)∩E(Fi)|=r, 1 ≤ i ≤ m. If for any partition {A1,A2,…,Am} of E(H) with |Ai|=r, G admits a (g, f)-factorization with Ai⊆E(Fi), 1 ≤ i ≤ m, then we say that G admits (g, f)-factorizations randomly r-orthogonal to H. It is trivial that randomly 1-orthogonal is equivalent to 1-orthogonal and 1-orthogonal is also said to be orthogonal. A graph denoted by G=(X,Y,E(G)) is called a bipartite graph with bipartition {X, Y} and edge set E(G).
Alspach et al. [13] presented the following question: For a given subgraph H of G, does there exist a factorization F of G with some fixed type orthogonal to H?
Li and Liu [4] showed that every (mg+m−1,mf−m+1)-graph G admits a (g, f)-factorization orthogonal to arbitrary given m-subgraph. Li et al. [5] justified that for every (mg+k,mf−k)-graph G and its any given k-subgraph H, there exists a subgraph R such that R has a (g, f)-factorization orthogonal to H. Liu and Long [14] verified that every (mg+m−1,mf−m+1)-graph G has a (g, f)-factorization randomly r-orthogonal to arbitrary given mr-subgraph H. Liu and Dong [15] proved that every bipartite (mg+m−1,mf−m+1)-graph G admits a (g, f)-factorization orthogonal to k vertex disjoint m-subgraph. Liu and Zhu [16] justified that every bipartite (mg+m−1,mf−m+1)-graph admits (g, f)-factorizations randomly r-orthogonal to any given mr-subgraph. Zhou [17] studied the orthogonal (0, f)-factorizations in bipartite (0,mf−(m−1)r)-graphs.
Theorem 1(Zhou [17]). Let G be a bipartite (0,mf−(m−1)r)-graph, and let f be an integer-valued function defined on V(G) with f(x) ≥ 2r for every x ∈ V(G), and let H be an mr-subgraph of G. Then G admits a (0, f)-factorization randomly r-orthogonal to H.
In this paper, the result in [17] is extended, and it is verified that every bipartite (0,mf−(m−1)r)-graph G admits a (0, f)-factorization randomly r-orthogonal to n vertex disjoint mr-subgraphs. Our main result will be shown in Section 3.
