Computing and data centers (CDCs) with buildings, services and computing and data processing facilities (e.g. servers, computing telecommunication equipment, air conditioners and power equipment, [1]) have rapidly developed over the past 40 years. In 2010, the total electrical energy used in CDCs was around 1.3% of the world's total energy consumption, with a rate of 1.4% in Europe and 1.5% in China [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Europe currently has 1148 data centers [5] that consume more than 100 TWh of electricity each year. In China, the CDC capacity reached 28.5 GW in 2013 [3,6], with 549.6 TWh annual electrical consumption. The CDC capacity continues to expand globally and the CDC electrical energy consumption will continue to grow at an annual rate of 15–20% in the foreseeable future [7].
The Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), which is defined as the ratio of the total energy used by CDC facilities to the energy delivered to the computing equipment, is about 1.9 in the USA, 2.53 in Europe and 2.5 in China [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. This means that 40%–60% of the electricity delivered to CDCs is used for operating the service facilities (largely for air conditioning), so the CDC operations are very inefficient. Space cooling is a fundamental need of CDCs to remove the tremendous amount of heat dissipated by the IT equipment to keep an adequate space temperature which consumes 30%–40% of energy delivered to the CDCs [[1], [2], [3], [4]]. Thus, CDCs need very efficient cooling systems.
The most common cooling equipment for CDCs is mechanical vapour compression air conditioners, which makes use of high grade energy (i.e., electricity) at relatively low efficiencies (i.e. Coefficients of Performance (COP) of 2–3), leading to an environmentally unfriendly operation.
Since CDCs operate continually every day of the year, natural cooling resources can be used to save energy. Natural cooling resources can be used by direct cooling and indirect cooling systems. Direct cooling systems bring outdoor air directly into the room, which may result in humidity problems and increased pollutants and dust in the CDCs. Indirect cooling systems separate the indoor and outdoor air streams with a heat exchanger such as an air-air heat exchanger or heat pipes, which ensure the humidity and cleanliness requirements of the indoor air.
Heat pipes are very effective heat transfer devices that can efficiently transmit heat over a long distance through a small area without additional power. Heat pipes can be divided into the integral and separated types. Separated heat pipes are much more mature and more widely used than integral heat pipes in CDC cooling systems. However, heat pipe cooling can only be used when the outdoor temperature is below the required temperature and need to be combined with other cooling systems, usually mechanical vapour compression cooling systems, to provide cooling throughout the year. Different kinds of heat pipe systems that have been proposed for CDC cooling systems are summarized in Table 1.Table 1. Recent heat pipe research for CDC cooling systems.ResearcherHeat Pipe SystemYearWeber and Wyatt [8]Integrated heat pipe system with a pressurized air duct2011Xia et al.

Although heat pipe-vapour compression compound cooling systems save much energy compared to simple mechanical vapour compression cooling systems, the electricity energy consumption is still large when the outdoor air temperature is high, and needs to be further reduced by new cooling methods.
Evaporative cooling can conserve energy and protect the environment by using water evaporation to efficiently absorb the heat [18]. The existing evaporative cooling systems can be classified into direct evaporative cooling (DEC) and indirect evaporative cooling (IEC) systems. Indirect evaporative cooling system, where the product air in dry channel and working air and water film in wet channel are separated by heat exchange plate, can lower the product air temperature without adding moisture to product air, so they are more suitable for air conditioning in more climates than DEC systems and, thus, are more widely used [[19], [20], [21]]. Many evaporative cooling systems have been used for CDC cooling like direct evaporative cooling system [22], indirect evaporative cooling with direct expansion refrigeration system [23], and indirect evaporative cooling with dew-point evaporative cooling system [24]. However, evaporative cooling systems are not widely used because of their relative low energy efficiencies, large volumes and restrictions on the supply air temperature [25]. A counter-flow corrugated plate dew-point evaporative cooler is described in this paper that gives higher cooling efficiencies (wet-bulb efficiency) and energy efficiency (COP) than ordinary indirect evaporative cooling by improving the design of the indirect evaporative cooling system. Experimental results show that the cooling efficiency can reach 125% and the COP can reach 43 for a 10 kW dew-point evaporative cooler. Thus, dew-point evaporative cooling has great potential for saving energy in CDC cooling. However, the dew-point evaporative cooler, as a standalone system with an air exhaust tube, can only supply air centrally, e.g. the upper air supply or the downside air supply, while the evaporators with the separated heat pipes can be distributed to each IT system to further improve the heat transfer efficiency.
The heat pipe and dew-point evaporative cooler are both energy efficient and environmentally friendly but the heat pipe can only be used when the outdoor temperature is below a certain temperature while the dew-point evaporative cooler can give high cooling efficiencies even with high outdoor temperatures. Therefore, a heat pipe-dew-point evaporative cooler hybrid cooling system is proposed and analysed here to satisfy the CDC cooling requirements and simultaneously save enormous amounts of energy.
This paper describes two hybrid cooling systems combining micro-channel separated heat pipes with dew-point evaporative coolers with the energy saving potentials of the two hybrid cooling systems analysed through calculations.
