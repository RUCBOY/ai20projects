It is traditionally accepted that plastic deformation of materials obeys Schmid's law. The Schmid's law [1], [2] tells that dislocation slip would occur when the shear stress resolved on the glide plane and in the glide direction reached a critical value, the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS). However, the cases of Schmid's law breakdown are also known. The most prominent example of non-Schmid behavior is slip in bcc metals, such as tungsten or molybdenum [3], [4], [5]. The CRSS is dependent on the stress components perpendicular to the Burgers vector for glide of 1/2[1 1 1] dislocation in bcc materials [6].The deviations from Schmid law are also observed in intermetallic compounds (e.g. Ni3Al) [7], [8], [9] with L12 structure.
Twinning is another deformation mode, which in general obeys the Schmid law. However, the non-Schmid behavior of twinning in hcp metals was discussed recently in literature. Such behavior was reported for twinning in magnesium and its alloys [10], [11], [12]. A significant portion of twins with low Schmid factor was observed in hcp Zr [13]. Importance of non-Schmid stress on twinning nucleation mechanisms in magnesium was also mentioned [14].
The non-Schmid behavior of bcc metals is caused by non-planar dissociation of slip dislocations [15]. The effect of non-glide components of applied stress in bcc metals can be understood in the following way. Dislocation core dissociates in several planes producing partials connected by stacking fault segments. Such dissociation can be profitable from energetical point of view. Some of these partials can have Burgers vector components perpendicular to the initial Burgers vector of the dislocation. The sum of perpendicular components is zero. However, they can be affected by stress components perpendicular to the whole Burgers vector of dislocation. As results the dislocation motion is also affected by these components. Due to presence of dissociated dislocation similar scenario is also possible in close packed structures such as fcc and hcp. However, it is generally accepted that effect is not so large as in the case of bcc structure. For instance, Nabarro [16] considered deviations from Schmid law for screw dislocation in fcc structure. He concluded that reduction in CRSS caused by the dissociation of dislocation is almost negligible and deviations from Schmid law are unobservably small. On the other hand, the significant inclination from Scmid law was observed in Zn single crystals [17], where variation in the resolved normal stress resulted in a 30 percent drop in the resolved shear stress.
It is worth noting that hcp crystals reveal significant plastic anisotropy in contrast to fcc crystals. For instance, the ratio of CRSS for basal and non-basal slip can reach values of 1:80 [18], [19], [20], [21], [22] in magnesium alloys. Besides large variations can arise in the relative values of CRSS for different slip modes. It is sometimes accepted [19] that these variations can be originated from hardening phenomena. However, it is can be supposed that partially they can be caused by non-Schmid effect. The aim of present paper is to explore non-Schmid behavior of screw 1/3[112¯0] dislocation in magnesium by computer simulations. We would like to demonstrate the phenomenon for basal and prismatic slip and to open discussion about importance of non-Scmid effects in magnesium.
