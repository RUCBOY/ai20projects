Organisms, which are exposed to the freezing conditions, produce special proteins, called antifreeze proteins (AFPs) [1, 2]. AFPs bind to small ice crystals to forestall additional crystallization and depress the freezing point of the solution below the melting point [3, 4, 5, 6]. Additional terms have also been proposed in the literature to name the AFPs: ice structuring proteins and thermal hysteresis proteins [4, 7].
For the first time, AFPs were found in the species of fish and insect that had adapted to extremely low temperatures [3, 8], and the structures of 5 structurally distinct AFPs were identified by Davies and Hew in 1990 [9]. AFPs have also been found in fungi, bacterial species and overwintering plants [10, 11, 12]. AFPs have potential applications in preservation, gene transformation, cryosurgery of tumors, and also in agriculture to produce economically efficient fishes and plants, resisting against extremely low temperatures [13, 14].
Recently, two computational approaches have been proposed to discriminate AFPs from non-AFPs [15, 16], but these methods do not have a satisfactory performance. By considering the substantial differences in the sequence and structure of AFPs [17, 18], it is needed to use suitable machine learning methods to predict AFPs. An appropriate machine learning algorithm offers a cost-effective approach to construct predictive models to identify AFPs by exploiting experimentally validated training data. In this article, we proposed a computational method to identify AFPs, which achieved an accuracy of 95% and 91% on two benchmark datasets and the accuracy of 96% on an independent test dataset.
