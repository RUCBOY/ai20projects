Let Γ be a connected graph with vertex set V={v1,v2…,vn}. The distance between vi and vj, denoted by d(vi,vj) (or di,j for short), is the length of a shortest path between vi and vj. The neighbourhood of vi is the collection of all vertices adjacent to vi, denoted by N(vi), that is, N(vi)={vj|d(vi,vj)=1}. The diameter of Γ, denoted by d(Γ), is the largest distance in Γ. The distance matrix of Γ, denoted by D(Γ), is the n×n matrix whose (i,j)-entry is equal to d(vi,vj), for 1≤i,j≤n. The eigenvalues of D(Γ), listed by ∂1≥∂2≥⋯≥∂n, are the distance eigenvalues of Γ. The multiset of distance eigenvalues of Γ is the distance spectrum of Γ, always denoted by SpecD(Γ)={[∂1]m1,…,[∂s]ms}, where ∂1>⋯>∂s and the superscript mi is the multiplicity of ∂i. We refer the reader to the survey paper [1], for more details about the backgrounds and applications of distance matrix.
If a graph contains no induced C4, P4 or 2K2, then it is a threshold graph. A threshold graph can be obtained by repeatedly performing one of the following two operations: (a) adding a new vertex adjacent to none of the former vertices (such vertex is called a separate vertex); (b) adding a new vertex adjacent to all of the former vertices (such vertex is called a dominating vertex). Let Γ be a threshold graph of order n, whose vertex set is labelled as {v1,…,vn} such that vi is the added vertex in the i-th step of the operations. We can use a {0,1}-sequence b=(b1,…,bn) to represent Γ, where bi=0 if vi is a separate vertex and bi=1 if vi is a dominating vertex. As usual, we set b1=0. Obviously, Γ is connected if and only if bn=1. Note that the successive separate vertices have the same properties and the successive dominating vertices have the same properties. We collect the successive 0s and 1s together in b. Therefore, the sequence b can be written as b=(0s1,1t1,…,0sm,1tm), where si,ti≥1 for 1≤i≤m and m≥1. This sequence is the representation sequence of Γ, and Γ is uniquely determined by its representation sequence. For example, the threshold graphs with representation sequences (02,12,0,1) and (0,1,02,12) are shown in Fig. 1.Download : Download high-res image (39KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Example of threshold graphs.
Threshold graphs were first introduced by Chvátal and Hammer [19] and Henderson and Zalcstein [8] in 1977. After that, threshold graphs have been paid close extensive attention because of their numerous applications in computer science and psychology [19]. Recently, many mathematicians studied the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of threshold graphs. In 2011, Sciriha and Farrugia [21] gave some spectral properties of adjacency eigenvalues of threshold graphs. In 2013, Bapat [2] obtained the determinant of the adjacency matrix of threshold graphs and he gave the nullity of threshold graphs as well. In the same year, Jacobs et al. [12] presented an O(n) algorithm for constructing a diagonal matrix congruent to Bx=A+xI for any x. By using this method, they published several papers [12], [14], [15] to investigate the properties of adjacency eigenvalues of threshold graphs from 2013 to 2015. Especially, they obtain the inertia of the adjacency matrix of threshold graphs and they show that all eigenvalues of threshold graph, other than 0 or −1, are simple. In 2017, Banerjee and Mehatari [3] studied the eigenvalues of the normalized matrix (which is similar to the Randić matrix) of threshold graphs.
In this paper, we focus attention on the distance matrix of threshold graphs because the distance matrix seems to contain more informations of a graph than other matrices. It not only reflects whether two vertices are adjacent or not, but also the distance between them. Besides, it is hot topic to study the eigenvalues of the distance matrix of a graph ever since the appearance of the paper [6] by Graham and Pollack, which established a relationship between the number of negative eigenvalues of the distance matrix and the addressing problem in data communication systems. In this paper, we show that all distance eigenvalues of threshold graphs, other than −2 or −1, are simple, a fact reported in [13]. Moreover, we prove that there is no distance eigenvalue that lies in the interval (−2,−1). We obtain formulas for the multiplicities of −2 and −1, the formulas for −2 also reported in [20]. As another main result, we find that there are exactly ⌊n2⌋ threshold graphs with distinct distance eigenvalues and completely determine such graphs as well.
