Verification of monitor units (MU) is an important step to ensure patient safety and the accurate delivery of radiotherapy (RT). Even in the era of three-dimensional (3D) planning, which includes stereotactic RT and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), most adverse events have been traced back to the treatment planning phase [1], [2], [3], [4]. In response to several serious incidents, multiple bodies have recommended performing in vivo dosimetry and/or implementing independent MU verification as a part of pretreatment plan checks [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Various calculation methods have been proposed for independent MU verification, including spreadsheets, secondary treatment planning systems (TPS), and Monte Carlo calculations [8], [9], [10], [11]. The Clarkson-type calculation [12], [13] is not new but is still commonly used. The American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) Task Group (TG) 114 has reported on the purpose, tolerance, and limits of such independent dose calculations. However, the AAPM TG-114 document is concerned with independent dose calculation in conventional RT, not IMRT. Furthermore, the AAPM TG-219 report, which includes independent dose calculation for IMRT, has not yet been released.
CyberKnife irradiation is performed using multiple small beams, and ionization chambers and film are commonly used for dose verification measurements [14], [15], [16]. For the secondary planning check for CyberKnife, the AAPM TG-135 document for quality assurance of robotic radiosurgery states that the disagreement between the TPS and dose verification calculation software program should be within 2% for the composite of all beams for which the point is within the penumbra or in-field region [17]. In other words, assessment of points outside the penumbra region is excluded. In addition to treatments in the brain, CyberKnife has been used for lung, liver, and prostate treatments in several treatment facilities. The target volume is frequently larger than the collimator size, and therefore, non-isocentric irradiation and two or more collimator settings are often used. Thus, the point dose has contributions from the dose outside the penumbra region, and dose verification for the composite of all beams with points both within and outside of the penumbra region is needed.
The Vero4DRT system utilizes fixed primary and secondary collimators in the gantry head, with the radiation field additionally shaped by a multileaf collimator (MLC) [18], [19], [20]. Vero4DRT was developed for gimbal-based tracking irradiation to provide high-precision radiotherapy in techniques such as IMRT, stereotactic radiosurgery, and stereotactic body radiation therapy. The other configurations of Vero4DRT are similar to those of C-arm linear accelerators. Dose verification for Vero4DRT is usually carried out by pre-treatment measurements [21]. A study investigating Monte Carlo methods for independent verification calculations for the Vero4DRT has been published [22]; however, there has been no report on the use of the Clarkson method for dose verification with Vero4DRT, even though such methods are often used for independent verification of other radiation systems.
The TomoTherapy system can deliver IMRT via a helical trajectory, using 6-MV X-rays in a fan beam with couch translation, gantry rotation, and a 64-leaf binary MLC to deliver optimized dose distribution [23], [24]. In general, measurement using a verification device such as an ionization chamber, film, or pseudo three-dimensional detector is commonly performed for patient-specific QA for TomoTherapy because of the complexity of the delivery, which uses many control points. Secondary checks for TomoTherapy should improve its efficiency while maintaining safe delivery. A commercial software program is available specifically for TomoTherapy, as most other verification programs cannot be used for it. In terms of research publications, Gibbons et al. proposed a method to calculate the point dose independently utilizing the planned treatment sinogram and beam data commonly used in MU calculations [25]. Nicos et al. developed an independent dose calculation software program for TomoTherapy using the method proposed by Gibbons et al., using 50 treatment plans to compare the program with a TPS [26]. All differences were within 5%, and the mean dose difference was 0.22 ± 1.77%. An alternative approach was taken by Pisaturo et al., who performed independent dose calculation for TomoTherapy with a Monte Carlo simulation method using EGSnrc/BEAMnrc code. [27] However, these previous studies were conducted using in-house programs and phantom studies and did not use clinical treatment plans.
There have been only limited reports about independent MU/dose calculation verification for the CyberKnife, Vero4DRT, and TomoTherapy systems, but there have been no reports of inter-institutional comparisons. There are no existing guidelines for independent calculation verification on these systems, and few publications have reported simple dose calculation algorithms for such verification. Therefore, we implemented the Clarkson-based dose calculation algorithm on these systems and performed the first multi-institutional study of independent calculation verification in these three modalities, addressing the agreement between primary and secondary calculations in 12 institutions. Retrospective analysis was performed to compare independent dose verification, which was calculated using Clarkson-based dose calculation verification software, between the treatment facilities. Inter-institutional differences were also evaluated to understand the differences in plan quality between institutions and to demonstrate the potential impact of institution-specific action levels.
