The latest discovery from the serotoninergic system, the 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) [[1], [2], [3]], is the subject of many studies concerning CNS functioning. 5-HT7R plays a pivotal role in various physiological processes, e.g. thermoregulation, circadian rhythm, learning and memory [4]. Moreover, it seems to contribute in pathological processes, including schizophrenia, migraine or stress [5]. Preclinical studies involving commonly used behavioral tests on animals, the forced swim test (FST) and the tail suspension test (TST), have shown that antagonism of the 5-HT7 receptor causes anti-depressant effects in rats and mice [6,7].
Serotonin receptor 5-HT7, as a member of the GPCR superfamily, features a structure homologous to that of other receptors belonging to this group. Therefore, the design and synthesis of agents, which are not only potent but also selective, is highly complicated. To date, only one selective 5-HT7R ligand, compound JNJ-18038683, has been clinically evaluated to confirm its efficacy in patients with major depressive disorder. However, the obtained results are inconclusive because of the low sensitivity of the applied experiment [8]. Therefore, searching for novel selective 5-HT7R agents seems to be relevant in terms of future effective treatment of depression.
Recently, our group discovered the first potent and selective 5-HT7R ligand among 5-phenylhydantoin derivatives, the compound MF-8 (1, Fig. 1) [9]. Further studies led to the synthesis, biological evaluation and structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis of 14 derivatives of 1 [10], resulting in the selection of three substituents at the piperazine moiety (Fig. 1) that provide the best potency and selectivity [10].Download : Download high-res image (174KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. General structure of the investigated hydantoin compounds and beneficial substituents at piperazine found during previous modifications of lead MF-8 (1) [10]. The area of present modifications marked in grey.
This current study is the next step, in that it concerns an evaluation of the role of substituents at position 5 of hydantoin in terms of the desired pharmacological action on 5-HT7R (Fig. 1). Thus, sixteen new derivatives 4-19 (Table 1) were designed and synthesized. For one representative compound (4), the crystal structure was determined experimentally to support molecular modeling studies for the whole series, including both pharmacophore and structure-based approaches, by using docking and molecular dynamics simulations for the receptor-ligand complexes. All compounds (4-19) were investigated in radioligand binding assays to estimate their 5-HT7R affinity and selectivity over 5-HT1AR and D2R as well as over adrenoceptors α1-AR, α2-AR and β1-AR for representative members (1, 3-12). The most active 5-HT7R agents (5-8) were also assessed for their antidepressant and anxiolytic-like effects in vivo in mice. Finally, the computer-aided SAR analysis was discussed.Table 1.
