Chronic anal infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) is a known risk factor for anal carcinoma. The pathophysiology of HPV-associated carcinoma involves sexually-transmitted infections with high-risk HPV subtypes, chronic infection, altered immunity and a dysplasia to carcinoma sequence [2], [3]. Because cost-effective methodologies exist to identify anal HPV infection, screening strategies can prevent the development of anal cancer [3]. At present, routine screening for anal dysplasia and cancer is limited to HIV-infected patients and men having sex with men (MSM) [4], [5]. The economics and clinical benefits of anal HPV screening in women with cervical HPV infection is not clearly defined [6]. Only one national society guideline has recommended anal cancer screening in women with abnormal cervical cytology [7], even though women with cervical HPV are seven times more likely to have an anal HPV infection [8]. Furthermore, almost 50% of women with cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) or microinvasive cancer have anal HPV infections [9]. Because the vast majority of cervical and anal cancers result from the same high-risk HPV subtypes, identifying patients with these infections is a high priority. In this study, a dynamic model was developed to estimate anal histologic outcomes in women with histories of cervical cancer and to examine the effects of screening for anal HPV on the costs and development of anal cancer.
