The remarkable thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [1,2] make them ideal candidates for diverse engineering and biomedical applications [[3], [4], [5], [6]]. The intramolecular junctions created by joining multiple CNTs have fascinating features different from individual CNTs [7] with promising applications in mechanical shock absorption [8] as well as in electronic devices [9,10]. Two dissimilar nanotubes can be connected with a single heptagon-pentagon pair of defects resulting in a two terminal (2T-) junction [11]. The 2T-junctions are either metal/semiconductor, metal/metal or semiconductor/semiconductor types depending on the chirality of the connected nanotubes and can have multiple applications in nano-electronics. For example, metal/semiconductor junction has a rectifying property and can be used as rectifying diodes [10]. However, having only two terminals, 2T-junctions are less flexible compared to the three terminal (3T-) devices, where the third terminal can be used for switching, power gain, or current modulating properties as in nano-transistors [12].
The structural model of 3T-junction was first proposed by Scuseria [13] in 1992 and was later observed by Zhou et al. [14]. Afterwards, 3T-junctions have been synthesized using pyrolysis [15,16], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [17], and electron beam welding [18]. While CNT based nano-electronic devices have shown great promise in variety of applications [3,9,10,19], challenges still remain in their controlled nano-fabrication, which also include synthesis of multiple terminal junctions. Recent experimental studies towards the successful synthesis of carbon nanotube based nano-porous foams [[20], [21], [22], [23]] have re-ignited the experimental community to go a step further towards controlled fabrication of foam structures such as ligament nodes, pore density and macroscopic distribution. Among these, structure of node (or junction), where several nanotubes or nano-fibers come together (in other words, multi-terminal junction), is expected to play an important role in the macroscopic structure-property relationship of the foams. Here, it should be noted that the direct structure-property relationship characterization of individual ligament nodes in such nano-porous structures is extremely difficult due to the length scales involved (∼nm), and requires designing extremely specialized instrumental techniques [24]. Computational modeling of these complex nanotube junctions offers guidance to material processing scientists on suitable approaches for junction fabrication. Such studies, however, require accurate model development of these complex junctions.
Different methods have been used in literature to develop and model CNT based junctions, most of which are based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In 1997, Menon and Srivastava [25] proposed stable T-junctions optimized using general tight binding molecular dynamics (GTBMD). A year later, they explored the possibility of creating Y-junction with only pentagon-octagon pairs and no heptagon [26]. Krasheninnikov et al. [27], Jang et al. [28] and, Piper et al. [29] modeled X-junction by simulating CNT welding using classical MD. Besides, 3T- and 4T-junctions have also been generated by self-assembling graphene nanoribbons [30] and tight binding MD simulations [31]. While MD based simulations have energetically stable results, they require the system to be equilibrated over considerable amount of time and hence, are computationally expensive. In addition, as MD simulations are deterministic in nature, the outcome of non-hexagonal topology around the junction often depends upon initial conditions of nanotube atomic positions.
3D models of fullerene and closed nanotubes have been generated using graph theory, adjacent matrix eigenvector (AME), and force-field optimization techniques [32,33]. But, the complex nature of the nanotube junctions makes it extremely difficult to be modeled using these techniques. An alternative approach to creating nanotube junctions is a computer-aided design (CAD) based primal/dual mesh optimization scheme, where triangular meshes called ‘primal’ meshes are generated first, followed by the ‘dual’ meshes [34]. The dual of a primal triangular mesh is another mesh with each of its vertices representing the centroid of the triangular elements of the parent mesh. The resulting dual mesh depends on the valence of the primal node, which is an integer number representing the number of edges attached to the node [35]. Triangular meshes have been used previously to model complex hexagonal geometries e.g. organic mesh models [36] and architectural designs [37]. A regular triangular mesh with nodes having valence 6 would result in a dual mesh of uniform hexagonal elements. Thus, a regular triangular mesh can be considered ideal for modeling carbon nanotube systems since, nanotubes have carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal honeycomb pattern. Furthermore, triangular meshes are easier to construct, manipulate and optimize compared to creating hexagonal meshes directly to represent the carbon atoms. Therefore, a CAD based primal/dual mesh optimization approach, which uses the framework of triangular meshing and generating its dual, is proposed in this work to model nanotube junctions. The advent of new features in CAD platforms and optimization techniques has made it possible to construct multiple junctions in a reduced amount of time. In this approach, we pay special focus on the position of the carbon atoms, which are adjusted such that the deviation from an accepted C-C bond length is maintained at a minimum to achieve different junction configurations. Among these CAD based configurations, the junctions with minimum number of defects are chosen to construct complex 2D and 3D architectures. From these models, the configuration with the minimum potential energy, as calculated from force-field based molecular mechanics method, can be further chosen to study the structure-property relationships.
The organization of this paper is as follows: the topology of single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and nanotube junctions are discussed in section 2.1. In sections 2.2–2.4, the CAD based approach to construct (n,0) nanotube junctions is discussed. The results of the current approach and the method to create 4T-junction, 2D microstructures and 3D nanotube architectures are presented in section 3. All the CAD models in this work are developed using Rhinoceros 5 by Robert McNeel & Associates [38], and using Grasshopper (Version 0.9.0076) [39], the algorithmic based modeler for Rhinoceros 5.
