Linear predictive coding has been widely used in low-bit-rate speech coders. Desired results are achieved by the use of an all-pole model in this algorithm to simulate the vocal tract in producing voiced sounds. However, as the nasal cavity opens and the end of the vocal tract branches during nasal sound production, a pole-zero or higher-order all-pole model is necessary to model the vocal tract. The lower-order all-pole model used in low-bit-rate speech coding cannot accurately simulate the vocal tract, making the sound quality of synthesized nasal syllables less ideal [1]. Liu et al. developed an improved split-vocal-tract model to analyze nasal sounds in a better manner but did not apply it to low-bit-rate speech coders [1].
The Levinson-Durbin algorithm, in addition to being used in linear predictive coding [2], is widely adopted in many signal processing situations, such as active noise control [3], autoregressive model estimation [4], wave propagation modeling in layered media [5], acoustic echo cancelling [6], maximum entropy spectrum estimation [7], and minimum mean-square error equalizer [8], etc. The underlying concept is to solve the Yule-Walker equation recursively.(1)[R0R1R2⋯RM−1R1R0R1⋯RM−2R2R1R0⋯RM−3⋯⋯⋯⋯⋯RM−1RM−2RM−3⋯R0]·[a1a2a3⋯aM]=[b1b2b3⋯bM]
Without losing generality, the Yule-Walker equation can be written as in (1). The first matrix on the left is the Toeplitz matrix, which is written in vector form as in (2), with bold letters having arrow above representing vectors, and those without arrows indicating the matrices.(2)RM⋅A→M=B→M
There are also many improved versions of the Levinson-Durbin algorithm. Yu et al. proposed a multi-stage Levinson-Durbin algorithm, which gives more numerically robust results for input signals with high spectral dynamics [9]. Delsarte et al. generalized the Levinson-Durbin algorithm for Hermitian Toeplitz matrices with any rank profile [10]. Frakt et al. generalized the algorithm for covariance extension and applied the method to multiscale autoregressive modeling [11].
The step size of the conventional Levinson-Durbin algorithm is 1 during iterations, while that for the direct computation of the inverse matrix is M, the order of the matrix. Based on these, the conventional Levinson-Durbin algorithm is generalized here to change the recursion step size to a positive integer s (0 < s < M), which is variable during recursion. This generalized algorithm is then applied to linear predictive coding, and found to enhance the sound quality of nasal syllables to a certain extent. The subjective perception of the sounds and the PESQ MOS score are both improved [12].
