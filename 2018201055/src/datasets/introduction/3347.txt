Economical inequality and long-tailed income distributions – inevitable and vital paradigms in modern societies [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]– offer interesting subjects of investigation for societal and physical-mathematical sciences, see also Refs. [7], [8], [9]. For a long time economists have been trying to pinpoint the exact reasons of monetary inequalities, and to quantitatively answer the question how income and wealth are distributed.
Historically, a number of attempts were made to answer these questions. More than a century ago, Pareto performed extensive studies in Europe and found that the income distributions possess power law tails [10], in contrast to the Gaussian financial market models of Regnault and Bachelier [11], [12]. Mandelbrot then picked up on Pareto’s ideas and coined the term strong Pareto law for the income distribution [13]. Gibrat worked on similar aspects of the wealth distribution and proposed a law of proportionate growth [14]. Gibrat realized that the Pareto’s law did not fit the whole range of the data, being valid only for the “rich end”. Champernowne considered the same problem proposing a probabilistic theory reproducing the Pareto’s law [15].
Today, we realize that the distributions of income indeed reveal some globally stable and robust features [16], [17], [18]. In general, the bulk of the distributions of income can be fitted reasonably well by the log-normal (Boltzmann–Gibbs) and Gamma distributions [3], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Economists prefer the log-normal form [19], [20] for the positively-defined measure of money, whereas physicists use the Gamma distribution [3], [21], [22]. The latter generally providing a better fit of the data [23], see also Ref. [25] There is more consensus on the upper end of the distribution described by the Pareto law [24], [26], [27], [28]. Recently, the income data analyses were extensively reviewed [2], [5].
The lack of easily-available data for the wealth distribution, analogous to yearly income-tax returns offering a measure of income [26], compels researchers to resort to indirect methods. For the income distribution, the analysis indicates that [2], [3], [5], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [26], [29], [30] (1)P(m)≃m−(1+μ)e−m∕mc,for incomes m smaller than a characteristic income dented mc, and the power-law form (2)P(m)≃m−(1+ν),for m≥mc. Here, μ and ν are the respective scaling exponents. The exponent ν is the Pareto exponent, typically ranging between one and three [22], [30], [31], [32], [33], so that a typical income 〈m〉 exists. For a historical overview of Pareto’s data and the recent progress we refer to Refs. [5], [34], [35] and to the study [33] for a double power law of P(m). The subject of income distribution got massive attention in the last decade [2], [5], [7], [8], [9], [18], [23], [26], [27], [29], [30], [33], [34], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66]. The crossover point mc in Eq. (1) can be practically extracted via fitting the initial Gamma distribution and the power-law tail in Eqs. (1) and (2) [22]. An alternative way to joint together the bulk Gamma distribution and the Pareto law for the tails is to choose mc such that the jointed distribution is continuous and differentiable at this point.
The allocation of wealth and income in a society is the subject of intense research in econophysics. Despite the decades of development and data analysis, the precise mathematical mechanisms are not fully understood. To reveal them, a number of models were proposed based on statistical mechanics analysis, see also Ref. [67]. In particular, to explain the functioning principles of trading systems, a number of ideal-gas saving-based models of closed economic systems were proposed [29], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59]. In these models, the total amount of money M plays the role of the kinetic energy of the gas particles and the elastic collisions of molecules represent the money-conserving trading events between the agents [50].
Two variants of saving-based models are of interest: the models in which all agents have the same saving factor λ and models with a quenched, random distribution of λ [50], as opposing to the annealed situation [56]. The authors of Ref. [50] considered an ideal-gas model with a fixed total money in the system of N agents. A fully-connected network of agents can be formed via N−1 links representing the “channels” for money transfer [50], mimicking money transport mechanisms in economical trading structures. No production or migration of money outside of the system occurs, and no debt is allowed. The economic activity is restricted to agent-to-agent trading events, see also Refs. [68], [69]. This is similar to an isolated thermodynamic system at equilibrium.
We here consider the one-dimensional closed (conservative) and open (non-equilibrium) economical model. We denote the person and wealth distributions as F(w) and W(w). F(w) quantifies the number of agents possessing the wealth in the interval from w to w+dw, [43] (3)F(w)dw=(Nw,w+dw∕N)dw.On the other hand, (4)W(w)dw=w(Nw,w+dw)dw.is the wealth of persons in the same wealth interval. In the limit of substantial dw∕w fractions, the distribution W(w) can be considered as the integral over the F(w) distribution in the range of wealth {w,w+dw}, in the sense of a Riemann sum. In simulations, we divided the interval of final wealth values w into ten subdivisions and recovered W(w) distributions presented below directly from the data. Clearly, the results for W(w) will depend on the number of subdivisions of the wealth interval (not shown).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce our agent-based model and present the main results of simulations for the closed system. In Section 3 we investigate the person F(w) and wealth W(w) distributions in an open system, and discuss the evolution of the total wealth wΣ(t) over time. We present some new results for open trading systems and unveil a Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts (KWW)-type stretched exponential decay for the cumulative wealth wΣ(t) for the non-conservative situation. The conclusions are given in Section 4.
