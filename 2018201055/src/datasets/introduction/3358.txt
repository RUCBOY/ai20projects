Breast cancer is a major cause of death in women [1]. It is reported that, in a lifetime of women worldwide, one in eight will develop breast cancer [2], [3]. Also, the reported statistics reveal that over 2 million women are suffering from breast cancer in the US alone [4]. To reduce the mortality rate from breast cancer, early diagnosis and treatments are essential [5]. MRI is a well-established imaging technique to identify and mitigate breast diseases by generating a series of 3D images that a radiologist uses to manually detect the diseased part and identify problems [6], [7]. The manual process is time consuming because of the high number of images [8], [9]. Hence, automatic computer-algorithm based image analysis has become essential for performing computer-aided detection and diagnosis, which aim to provide prompt output and help radiologist to accurately locate the diseased area.
The main objective of this study is to segment the breast region of interest (BROI) and breast density (BD) from breast MRIs. First, BROI segmentation can serve as the fundamental step for avoiding irrelevant structures such as unwanted background and organs like the heart, liver, and chest, improving efficiency and accuracy during further analysis like tumor segmentation [10]. Tumor segmentation in breast MRIs is considered to be a laborious and error-prone procedure. Also, tumors normally reside inside the BROI. Therefore, prior to tumor segmentation, it is essential to identify the BROI [11]. BROI segmentation is also useful for applications such as BD measurement [12] and performance improvement of DCE-MRI in terms of pharmacokinetics-model calibration (PMC) [12], [13]. During PMC, the properties of the interior chest wall should be determined, which requires pectoral muscle segmentation [14]. Second, the ratio of BD can be considered as a strong indicator for the estimation of breast cancer risk. Also, breast tissue pattern asymmetry in left and right breast is considered to be an abnormal biological process that leads to cancer [15]. BD does not have a distinct shape and pattern and may be found anywhere within the image. Moreover, intensity inhomogeneity is a common problem within breast MRIs since the bias field adds more challenges by producing similar intensity around the BROI.
For BROI segmentation, different techniques have been reported in the literature. Ertas et al. [16], performed morphological operation and intensity thresholding for the segmentation. However, the results are better when the chest wall has high contrast. Several other methods such as intensity histogram [17], [18], wavelet analysis [32], [19] and active contour [20], [21], fuzzy c-means [22], [23], region growing [24], [25] are proposed. The performance of these methods rely on the contrast between the border regions and can fail in the cases that have similar intensity distribution. A fully automated method reported by Wang et al. [29] extracts breast area on non-fat-suppressed MRI images. The author explained that the properties of pectoral muscle and the breast-air boundaries are similar in 3D and exhibit smooth sheet like surfaces and use a Hessian-based filter to suppress the lower contrast and non-specific shapes. However, this method does not include breast density segmentation and may not produce an accurate mask. Khalvati et al. [26] reported a multi-atlas segmentation algorithm that creates a breast atlas with the help of phase congruency. This segmentation process is reliant upon the shape and intensity based registration prior to the segmentation. Gubern-Merida et al. [33] proposed a probabilistic atlas based approach for breast segmentation. However, the accuracy depends upon the size and variability of the database and requires an atlas that is representative of the population, which is computationally expensive. An edge based approach was proposed by [28] that is independent from the visible contrast between the breast ROI and chest wall. This method calculates cost function using edge information obtained from tunable Gabor filter. The precision of this method depends upon the information from the adjacent slices and accurate initial-border determination. Despite the advancement in BROI segmentation, fully automatic, accurate and fast segmentation of BROI still require much attention. This is because: 1. MR breast imaging contains breast structures in different shapes and no clear boundary of breast landmarks, which requires manual correction [34]. 2. There is a bilateral asymmetry between left and right breast regions requiring separate analysis [35]. 3. The pectoral muscle is closely attached and possesses similar intensity to the BROI which gives false positives and requires manual corrections [36]. 4. It is observed from the literature that several existing methods are supervised and require prior information before the segmentation process which results in computational complexity [37]. For BD segmentation, we note that there is a significant range of studies carried out in a semi-automated segmentation using an interactive thresholding method [43], [44] and user-assisted clustering methods [45]. These non-automated methods are subjective and create inter- and intra-reader variability [46]. It can be time-consuming, and therefore unsuitable for processing larger databases. To cope with above-mentioned difficulties, some attempts on automated methods have been studied such as adaptive thresholding [47], atlas-based method [48], Gaussian distribution curve fitting [49], hierarchical support vector machine [50], and Otsu thresholding algorithm [51]. It is observed that supervised methods provide more accurate results, but require a complex and costly labelling and analysis by expert radiologists prior to segmentation. Hence, for automatic segmentation of BD, unsupervised methods produce efficient results. Also, the most effective way to minimize computation time is to reduce the number of pixels processed. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel framework which is fully automatic, unsupervised, fast and efficient. The proposed model is divided into two steps: 1. BROI segmentation 2. BD segmentation.
During BROI segmentation, first, we aim to de-noise the MR image and precisely remove air-background using pixelwise adaptive wiener filtering (PAWF) technique [38], [39] and k-means clustering [40]. PAWF technique can preserve the edges and high frequency parts of an image unlike a normal filtering technique and k-means clustering will automatically cluster the whole image on different group, based on the correlation of pixels intensity. Second, the heart area, a brighter part of image is segmented using active contour level-set method [41]. The novelty in this method involves the calculation of initial contour by using maximum entropy thresholding and convolution technique [63], [65], which provides accurate segmentation and reduction of computation speed. Third, the segmentation of the pectoral muscle is performed. The orientation of the pectoral muscle and breast density of the left, right, and central area of the breast are different. Hence, we apply a morphological operation on a different orientation to enhance the gap between the pectoral muscle and breast density. The resultant image is binarized using an adaptive thresholding technique to exclude the pectoral muscle. Finally, we use polynomial curve fitting [42] to smoothen the acquired BROI segmentation. During BD segmentation, initially, we de-noise the result image from BROI segmentation. It is observed from the experiment that, the volume and intensity of BD in left and right breasts are different, hence, the single threshold value could not provide accurate segmentation. We divide the BROI segmentation image according to its geometrical information and calculate a different threshold value for left and right breast using four level FCM [52]. This study calculates FCM within the BROI rather than on an entire image.
Rest of the paper is organized as follows. A detailed methodology of the segmentations (BROI and BD) is reported in Section 2 which includes the explanation of eliminating unwanted landmarks. In section 3, the experimental results are analyzed and discussed. Finally, a concluding remark drawn in this study is given in Section 4.
