Electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) are promising devices used for energy storage due to their high capacitance, which can be achieved by a distinctive interfacial structure, electric double layer (EDL) formed at the electrode. Ions in electrolyte of EDLCs, where ionic liquids (ILs) as well as aqueous electrolytes are commonly used, in contrast to dielectric materials, screen the electrode charges completely at sub-nanometer length scale to form a prominent EDL, with which the electrode can store more charges [1,2]. The structure of EDL thus crucially affects the capacitance, with a change of the stored charges in response to the external electric potential [[3], [4], [5]].
Much research on EDLCs has been dedicated to understanding of the dependence of differential capacitance (DC) on electrode potential. To explain DC behaviors, different theoretical approaches have been made. Bell-shaped [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]] and camel-shaped [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]] curves are explained by a mean field theory with “lattice saturation effect” [3,4,18,19] in which capacitance decreases as the electrode potential increases because electric double layer is thickened. As ion concentration increases, two maxima in camel-shaped DC get closer and eventually merge into single maximum of bell-shaped curve which is located at potential of zero charge (PZC). Monte Carlo simulation studies provide an alternative explanation of camel-shaped DC based on a coarse-grained model of ILs with neutral chain [8,20]. Neutral beads form “latent voids” near PZC. Maxima of DC at an intermediate potential are generated by replacement of latent voids by charged beads. In addition, the self-consistent mean field models explain the camel-shaped DC curve with the dependence of permittivity on the distance from the electrode surface [9,11].
Experimental studies of EDLCs have reported varied shapes of DC curves, even for the cases with the same set of electrolyte and electrode material. For the imidazolium-based ionic liquids, the camel-shaped DC curves were observed at glassy carbon electrode [13], but U-shaped curves were found in the case of glassy carbon [21], highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) [22], and graphene electrodes [23]. ILs with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium cation with different anions show camel-shaped curves [24]. On the other hand, bell-shaped [7] and U-shaped [25] curves were reported for 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate at the gold electrode.
To elucidate the microscopic picture of capacitance behavior of the system, both experimental [[26], [27], [28], [29]] and simulation [10,[30], [31], [32], [33]] studies have paid attention to charging mechanism of ions. Various mechanisms have been reported, namely anion-dominated [[29], [30], [31],33], cation-dominated [32,33], counterion-dominated [10], and equally-contributed [26,27]. The charging mechanisms of the systems have even been found to be a function of electric potential [10,[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]]. In spite of the great number of investigations of IL-electrode interfacial systems [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],[21], [22], [23],[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]], relation between charging mechanism and differential capacitance is still unclear.
Ionic liquids are engineered ionic materials which stay in the liquid phase at ambient temperatures, and are commonly employed as electrolytes in EDLCs due to their high ion conductivity and electrochemical stability [[1], [2], [3],37]. Rather recently developed and alternative to conventional electrolytes, ILs have unique properties such as non-volatility, non-flammability, solubility of both polar and nonpolar solutes, and easy recycling. Another remarkable feature of ILs is their enormous diversity generated by combinations of different cations and anions [37]. Often composed of organic ions, such combinations have been expanded by chemical tuning of ion structures [38,39].
Among the variety of ILs, the cyano-based have unique properties and have attracted different kinds of applications. Some liquids were suggested as possible solvent material for extractive distillation due to their high selectivity and reasonable solubility such as tetracyanoborate([B(CN)4]–)-based ILs and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide ([emim]+[N(CN)2]–) for aromatic/nonaromatic and ethanol/water separation, respectively [40]. 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate ([bmim]+[SCN]–) and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tricyanomethanide ([bmim]+[C(CN)3]–) were used as extracting solvents as they have high solubility of carbohydrates and sugar alcohols [41]. 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium thiocyanate ([emim]+[SCN]–) was employed as a local probe molecule in 2D-IR experiments because it does not affect structure and dynamics when it is mixed with other ILs [42]. High solubility of carbon dioxide was utilized in CO2 capturing [43,44]. Dicyanamide([N(CN)2]–)-based ILs have low viscosity and were applied in electrodeposition of metals [45]. Due to high conductivity and low viscosity, cyano-based ILs have been widely applied in dye-sensitized solar cells [[46], [47], [48]] as well as EDLCs [49].
Understanding the charging mechanism is very important when one utilizes ILs as energy storage material for EDLCs. The charging mechanism has been examined by counting the number of ions in the pore of electrode materials [[26], [27], [28], [29],32]. It was demonstrated that the effect of further ionic layers and the ion exchange behavior therein is required to be considered to explain the molecular origin of the DC behavior [5,10]. One of the attempts was to evaluate the charge of ionic layers with fixed thickness out of a number of trials [10]. The optimal thickness, however, was determined in an ad hoc manner, and little microscopic insight could be obtained from the result. To overcome this issue, we previously found that the DC behavior can be explained with the interfacial layer in which ions are most actively accumulated [5]. Nevertheless, it was not so straightforward to explain the saturation of DC at further potentials, which was predicted in mean field theory with “lattice saturation effect” [3,4,18,19].
The purpose of the present study is to investigate charging mechanism of EDLC with ILs and its molecular origin by decomposing it into contribution of each ionic species. This paper extends our previous study [5], where the cations were varied with different alkyl chain lengths, by systematically considering the effect of anions with charged functional groups. We examine the effect of cyano functional group of anion on electric double layer structure, differential capacitance and charging mechanism at graphene electrode, employing ILs with 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ([emim]+) cation. Anions contain one to four cyano groups, which are thiocyanate ([SCN]–), dicyanamide ([N(CN)2]–), tricyanomethanide ([C(CN)3]–), and tetracyanoborate ([B(CN)4]–), respectively.
The present paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the model system and simulation method. In Section 3, electric double layer structure, differential capacitance and charging mechanism of EDLC systems are analyzed to investigate their dependence on number of CN-groups. Conclusions are given in Section 4.
