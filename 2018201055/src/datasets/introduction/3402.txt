Interdisciplinarity is a characteristic of numerous disciplines, including library and information science (LIS). Interdisciplinarity manifests itself in interdisciplinary teaching and research activities (Luo, 2013). Interdisciplinary research is conducted by researchers from various disciplines and focuses on connecting or integrating an array of perspectives and skills (Aboelela et al., 2007). The benefits of interdisciplinary research are that it fosters growth in interdisciplinary projects, centers, and programs, which subsequently increases the amount of interdisciplinary research conducted and improves indicators measuring the degree of interdisciplinarity (Kodama, Watatani, & Sengoku, 2013; Omodei, De Domenico, & Arenas, 2017). The increasing trend in the degree of interdisciplinarity in LIS suggests that the impact of other disciplines on the LIS knowledge foundation has been growing (Chang & Huang, 2012; Larivi√®re, Sugimoto, & Cronin, 2012). This leads to a gradual change in landscape of LIS research because research topics, research methods, and research views of LIS are affected by other disciplines.
