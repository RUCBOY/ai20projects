LTE network or future generation network are typically based on integration of GSM and UMTS system, which will form the heterogeneous system. Basic LTE architecture is shown in Fig. 1.Download : Download high-res image (192KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. LTE architecture.
Long Term Evolution (LTE) network is a hybrid system, where a special type of node called eNB (evolved node base station) is deployed at the local network. LTE network can support any underneath radio networks, like Wi-Fi/Bluetooth, MANET etc., and integrate these networks for accessing internetwork. Basically LTE is a data packet network, where voice data is also packet data (prime example being Reliance Jio). The LTE network can provide maximum data rate of 300Mbps for downloading and 75 Mbps data rate for uploading transmission, where user equipment decides the data rate. The LTE network uses OFDMA modulation for down-link and SC-FDMA for up-link transmission. In LTE network, eNB node plays an important role for monitoring and transmission of data packets. Every eNB is responsible for data rate change, signal power and modulation index to every user nodes. Hence eNB nodes are responsible for resource allocation like bandwidth and power to local nodes. The job of eNB is to allocate minimum noise data path, which is more complex. This allocation is proposed and implemented in our work.
Neural networks are mainly used to predict the mobility of nodes in the wireless networks. It also used to reduce the complexity in real time applications.
