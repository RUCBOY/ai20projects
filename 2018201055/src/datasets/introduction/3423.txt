Tensors, also known as multi-way arrays, are generalizations of matrices to represent multi-way relationships of multiway data. For example, a three-mode tensor (user, advertisement, context) can be used to represent the multiway interaction in online advertising data. Tensor decomposition is a standard tool of analyzing tensor data, which shares the same spirit of factor analysis [1], [2], [3], [4] and aims to extract latent factors for each mode of tensor data. In the past decades, tensor decomposition methods have been used in various applications, such as compressing models in deep neural networks [5], [6], [7], providing integrated context information in recommendation systems [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], and processing high dimensional visual data in computer vision [13], [14]. Though there already exist several tensor decomposition libraries (which will be discussed in Section 2), it is still inconvenient for researchers to use tensor methods in their research. In 2016, TensorFlow [15] was proposed for latest research needs and GPU computing, and it has been widely used and various third-party packages [16], [17], [18], [19] have been developed. However, TensorFlow still lacks an out-of-the-box tensor decomposition package, harming the enthusiasm of researchers to investigate tensor methods.
Therefor,it is necessary to build a new tensor library based on TensorFlow such that it can provide tensor decomposition and other basic tensor operations for researchers. In this paper, we propose a open source, extensible tensor decomposition toolbox named TensorD2 to solve these problems.
