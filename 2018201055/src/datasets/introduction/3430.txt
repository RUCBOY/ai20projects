Topology optimization is a mathematical tool that optimizes material layout within a prescribed design domain in order to obtain the best structural performance under a given set of loads and geometric/physical constraints. Due to its broad applications, this tool has been studied extensively by both engineers and mathematicians for more than 40 years (see the comparative reviews [[1], [2]]). Generally speaking, a topology optimization problem involves both continuous state variable (such as the deformation field u(x)) and the density distribution ρ(x) that can take either the value 0 (void) or 1 (solid) at any point in the design domain. Thus, numerical discretization methods (say FEM) for solving topology optimization problems lead to a so-called mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which appears not only in computational engineering, but also in operations research, decision sciences, management optimization, industrial and systems engineering [3].
As one of the most challenging problems in global optimization, the MINLP has been seriously studied by mathematicians and computational scientists for several decades, many methods and algorithms have been proposed (see [4]). These methods can be categorized into two main groups [5]: deterministic and stochastic methods. The stochastic methods are based on an element of random choice. Because of this, one has to sacrifice the possibility of an absolute guarantee of success within a finite amount of computation. The deterministic methods, such as cutting plane, branch and bound, semi-definite programming (SDP), can find global optimal solutions, but not in polynomial time. Therefore, the MINLP is known to be NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard). Indeed, even the most simple quadratic integer 0–1 programming minx∈Rn12xTQx−xTf|x∈{0,1}nis considered to be NP-hard. This integer minimization problem has 2n local solutions. Due to the lack of global optimality criteria, traditional direct approaches can only handle very small size problems. Therefore, global optimization problems with 200 variables are referred to as “medium scale”, problems with 1000 variables as “large scale”, and the so-called “extra-large scale” is only around 4000 variables [6]. It was proved by Pardalos and Vavasis [7] that instead of the integer constraint, even the continuous quadratic minimization with box constraints 0≤x≤1 is NP-hard as long as the matrix Q has one negative eigenvalue. However, it was discovered by the author that these so-called NP-hard problems can be solved easily by canonical duality theory as long as the global optimal solution is unique [[8], [9], [3]].
In reality, the topology optimization has to handle huge-scale MINLP problems with millions of variables, various relaxation approaches and techniques have been developed by engineers, such as the homogenization [10], density-based method [11], phase field approach, topological derivatives [[12], [13]], the level set methods [[14], [15]], as well as the well-known SIMP (Simplified Isotropic Material with Penalization) [16] and evolutionary methods (ESO and BESO)  [[17], [18], [19]]. Most of these engineering approaches generally relax the MINLP as continuous parameter optimization problems, and then solve them based on the traditional Newton-type (gradient-based) methods. There exist several fundamental issues on these approaches. First, the relaxation from discrete to continuous optimization must be mathematically correct. Otherwise, the numerical results produced by these methods cannot convergent to mechanically sound structural topology. Second, the Newton-type algorithms can be used only for convex minimization. For nonconvex problems, numerical results obtained by these algorithms depend sensitively on initial data and numerical precisions adopted. It was discovered by Gao and his co-workers that the global optimal solutions are usually nonsmooth not only for coupled optimal design problems (see Chapter 7, [20]), but also for general nonconvex variational problems [21]. These nonsmooth solutions cannot be captured by any Newton-type algorithms. By the fact that the SIMP is not a mathematically correct penalty method, this most popular engineering approach can never produce exact integer solution for any given real-world problem. The existence of gray scale elements and appearance of checkerboards patterns are the SIMP’s two major intrinsic problems [[22], [23]]. Although the commercial code by the BESO can produce integer solutions, it was discovered recently [24] that this popular method is actually a direct approach for solving a knapsack-type problem and it is not a polynomial-time algorithm. This is the reason why the BESO is computationally expensive and can be used only for small sized problems.
Duality approaches for topology optimization have been studied via the traditional Lagrangian duality theory [[25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. However, the Lagrange multiplier method can be used mainly for convex problems with equality constraints [31]. For nonconvex problems, the Lagrangian L(x,y) is usually not a saddle function. By the fact that minxmaxyL(x,y)≥maxyminxL(x,y),the Lagrangian duality theory produces a so-called duality gap at each iteration. In order to reduce this duality gap, much effort has been made by mathematicians during the past 30 years [[32], [33]]. For inequality constraints, both the Lagrange multiplier and the constraint must satisfy the KKT conditions. The associated complementarity problem is very difficult even for linearly constrained problems in continuous space [34]. Although the augmented Lagrange multiplier method can be used for solving both equality and inequality constrained problems, the constraints must be linear since any simple nonlinear constraint could lead to a nonconvex minimization problem [31]. Unfortunately, all these mathematical difficulties were not correctly addressed in the topology optimization literature (see [[27], [28], [29]]).
Canonical duality theory (CDT) is a precise methodological theory, which can be used not only for modeling complex systems within a unified framework [35], but also for solving a large class of challenging problems in nonconvex analysis and global optimization [[20], [36], [37]]. Application of this theory to general topology optimization was given recently [[38], [36]]. It was discovered that the 0–1 integer programming in topology optimization for linear elasticity is actually equivalent to the well-known Knapsack problem, which can be solved analytically by the CDT [8]. The main goal of this paper is to present a detailed study on the canonical duality approach for solving general topology optimization problems with applications to 2-D and 3-D linear elastic structures. In the next section, the general topology optimization problem and its challenges are discussed. A mathematically correct topology optimization problem is formulated as a coupled bilevel knapsack problem. The conceptual mistakes in topology optimization and mathematical difficulties in SIMP method are discussed. Section 3 shows that the knapsack problem can be solved analytically to obtain global optimal solution at each iteration. A canonical dual algorithm for computing the globally optimal dual solution is explained in Section 4. Some fundamental issues on challenges in topology optimization and NP-hardness in computational complexity are addressed in Section 5. Numerical examples are reported in Section 6. Conclusion remarks are given in Section 7. A brief review of the canonical duality theory is provided in Appendix.
