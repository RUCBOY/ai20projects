The field of digital humanities (DH) straddles computing, arts and humanities, cultural and communication studies, education, and library and information science (LIS) (Klein, 2015). It leverages computational media to represent, manipulate, analyze, and interpret humanistic data (Davidson, 2017) and is almost invariably collaborative (Borgman, 2009; Burdick et al., 2012; Chan et al., 2017; McCarty, 2012). Inextricable from the future of the humanities writ large, it encourages innovative, even visionary and transformative, intellectual exploration (Svensson & Goldberg, 2015).
Some of the most transformative DH work falls under the aegis of the Digging into Data Challenges. The first Digging into Data Challenge (DID1, 2010-2012) brought together humanities scholars, computer scientists, and information professionals, fusing e-science and the humanities into “one culture” (Williford & Henry, 2012). Funded by four public agencies from three nations (the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada), the eight projects introduced a paradigm shift embracing new forms of scholarly data, tools, and publications (Williford & Henry, 2012).
In Digging into Data’s third round (DID3, 2014-2016), 10 agencies from four countries (the Netherlands joined the previous three nations) sponsored 14 international teams of scholars pursuing innovative, collaborative, interdisciplinary, and data-driven research in digital humanities (Garwood & Poole, 2018; Poole & Garwood, 2018). DID3 permits an examination of the working practices of digital humanities scholars in project environments, specifically the benefits and challenges of and lessons learned from such activity.
