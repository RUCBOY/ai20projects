Augmented Reality (AR) overlays virtual 3-Dimensional (3D) objects on the real-world and is starting to emerge in training and education [1], [2]. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) are computer-based systems that provide personalised learning support (such as error detection, feedback, and task selection) [3], according to a learner’s current (or projected) performance or skill in a task [4]. Combining AR with intelligent tutoring systems can potentially enhance learning on psychomotor and kinaesthetic tasks. In this paper, we describe the potential benefits of combining these two paradigms; present a series of design considerations and some possible areas for future research. Psychomotor learning involves using motor skills and precision in physical tasks to integrate domain knowledge. For example, learning how to effectively use tools to administer wound care [5], [6]. Similarly, kinaesthetic learning involves learning in a hands-on, practical way. For example, rather than reading about chemistry in a text book, the learner performs a hands-on experiment to further understand the chemical interactions [7].
Previous work has explored designs for AR training systems and ITSs, but very little work has focused on combining the two together [8], [9], [10], [11], even though doing so improves knowledge retention up to 25% in psychomotor tasks [12]. The two paradigms complement each other’s weaknesses. For instance, AR is well suited for improving skills in tasks that have a spatial component [13], [14], [15], but it has limited learning support, whereas ITSs have been shown to provide effective learning support in mathematics, engineering, science and technology, but has limited capabilities of providing intuitive instruction [8], [16], [17], [18]. Using AR with ITSs could enable AR annotations to be shown when an error is made by the learner, leading to higher knowledge gains compared to using AR alone [9]. However, there are no established guidelines for designing and implementing such systems. So, the aims of this paper are as follows:
1.Summarise existing AR training systems and ITSs, including their strengths, and weaknesses, and outline the key lessons they provide for building AR\ITS systems (Section 2)2.Development of a cohesive definition for Augmented Reality Adaptive Tutors (ARATs) (Section 3)3.Development of a series of guidelines for designing and implementing ARAT systems. (Section 4.1)4.Highlight key research gaps, limitations, trends and opportunities for further research (Section 5)
In achieving these aims, this paper makes the following contributions:
1.A review of the state of the art of AR and Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) learning experiences (Section 2)2.A proposed system, including a design space for categorising AR\ITS systems (Section 3).3.A set of design and implementation guidelines for AR\ITS systems (Section 4.1)
The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews AR and various AR training systems, their features and what lessons they provide; ITSs, their architecture and the different types of ITSs; a rationale for combining AR with ITSs and a list of some example AR training systems that have integrated ITSs. Section 3 proposes an ideal ARAT system, including its key architectural components and requirements. Section 4 details the design requirements for combining AR with ITSs and as such is the core focus of the paper. Section 5 details opportunities for future work such as user interface evaluation and finally, section 6 summarises the paper.
