The maximum number of minimal vertex covers that a graph on n vertices can have is equal to the maximum number of maximal independent sets, which is known to be 3n∕3 by a celebrated result of Moon and Moser [25]. This result is easily extended to an algorithm that enumerates all the minimal vertex covers of a graph within a polynomial factor of the given bound. The bound is tight as a disjoint union of n∕3 triangles has exactly 3n∕3 minimal vertex covers. These results have been extremely useful in many algorithms, e.g., they were used by Lawler [23] to give an algorithm for graph coloring, which was the fastest algorithm for this purpose for decades. For special graph classes, better bounds have been obtained, e.g., the tight bound for triangle-free graphs is 2n∕2, given by Hujtera and Tuza [21] with combinatorial arguments, and by Byskov [4] algorithmically. Also these results have been useful in several algorithms, e.g., for graph homomorphism [12]. Although connected vertex covers were defined and studied as early as vertex covers [16], interestingly the maximum number of minimal connected vertex covers in graphs or the enumeration of these has not been given attention.
In this paper, we study exactly these questions, and we give an algorithm for enumerating all minimal connected vertex covers of a graph in time O(1.8668n). We also give an upper bound 1.8668n on the number of such covers a graph can have. We provide a lower bound example, which is a graph that has 3(n−1)∕3 minimal connected vertex covers, leaving a gap between these bounds on general graphs. We are able to narrow this gap for graphs of chordality at most 5, and almost close the gap for chordal graphs and distance-hereditary graphs. In particular, we show that the maximum number of minimal connected vertex covers in chordal graphs, graphs of chordality at most 5, and distance-hereditary graphs, respectively, is at most 3n∕3, 1.6181n, and 2⋅3n∕3. All our bounds are obtained by enumeration algorithms whose running times correspond to the given bounds up to polynomial factors.
We would like to emphasize that our motivation for the given bounds and enumeration algorithms is not for fast computation of connected vertex covers of minimum size. In fact, as we will see in the next section, such sets can be computed in time O(1.7088n) on general graphs. Furthermore, Escoffier et al. [9] have shown that this problem can be solved in polynomial time on chordal graphs. The problem of computing minimum connected vertex covers is indeed well-studied with a large number of published results. These are nicely surveyed in the introduction given by Escoffier et al. [9].
Our motivation mainly comes from the fact that enumeration and maximum number of vertex covers are well studied, whereas connected vertex covers have been left unattended in this respect. Furthermore, the study of the maximum number of vertex subsets with given properties is a well-established area in combinatorics and graph theory. More recently, exponential time enumeration algorithms for listing such vertex subsets in graphs have become increasingly popular and found many applications [14]. For most of these algorithms, an upper bound on the number of enumerated subsets follows from the running time of the algorithm. Examples of such recent results, both on general graphs and on some graph classes, concern the enumeration and maximum number of minimal dominating sets [5], [11], minimal feedback vertex sets [6], [10], [17], minimal subset feedback vertex sets [13], [19], minimal separators [15], maximal induced matchings [2], and potential maximal cliques [15].
