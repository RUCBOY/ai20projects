Despite a long history in educational research, affective factors have been somewhat overlooked in research on multimedia learning (Astleitner and Wiesner, 2004, Leutner, 2014, Mayer, 2014a). This may be because traditional multimedia theory is based on a cold cognitivist approach which ignores the regulatory roles of motivation on cognition (Astleitner and Wiesner, 2004, Park et al., 2015a). With recent theoretical developments in multimedia learning (e.g., Moreno, 2006, Cognitive Affective Theory of Learning with Media or CATLM), there is considerable concern about the use of affective design issues in multimedia. Accordingly, emotional design in multimedia learning has been offered by researchers with the expectation of improving learners’ motivation to learn (Mayer and Estrella, 2014, Park et al., 2015b, Plass et al., 2014, Um et al., 2012).
Emotional design in multimedia is a relatively new approach, with studies regarding emotional design in their “infancy” (Mayer & Estrella, 2014, p. 12). Besides, most studies on emotional design compared multimedia materials that used multi-dimensional operationalization of emotional design (i.e., use of color, anthropomorphism and baby-face bias together) with neutral design. Moreover, when measuring emotion, researchers suggest that more direct measurement tools may be utilized (Dong, 2007, Mayer and Estrella, 2014). Therefore, this current study investigates the effect of emotional design on learning in a gradually increased manner rather than considering all emotional design elements together. Furthermore, instead of self-reported paper-and-pencil-based measures, the emWave emotion detection system is used, which is a more direct measure to detect learning emotions.
