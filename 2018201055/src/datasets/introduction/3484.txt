In the last few decades, a great number of attentions have been taken on studies of complex systems and networks in wide variety of fields, from computer science to mathematics, physics and biology science. For example, the World-Wide-Web (WWW) [1], the Internet, food webs [2], the collaboration networks [3], the web of sexual contacts [4], protein interaction networks [5], metabolic networks [6], [7], the scientific literature webs and so on [8], [9]. A network model can be investigated by its corresponding graph [10], [11], [12] which is a collection of vertices with edges connecting pairs of them at given mechanisms, such as random principle [13], the growth and preferential attachment presented by Barab√°si and Albert [14], and so forth. Besides some popular properties, scale-free feature, small-world character and community structure, having been deeply discovered and studied on amounts of artificial and real-life networks, some important structural and dynamical properties of network models can also be got from their panning trees.
Except for a having been researched measure (the number of walks) [15], as another important structure invariant, the number of spanning trees of a network model (graph) can only be regarded as a measure to model network security and predict this bearing capacity of fault-tolerance to random faults and of intrusion-tolerance to selective remove attacks [16]. As we know, the problem of computing the number of spanning trees of a finite graph has been solved by famous Kirchhoff's matrix-tree theorem, the product of all nonzero eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. But, for a huge-size graph with thousands of vertices and edges, this problem will become more intractable and tough. How to capture the accurate solutions of the number of spanning trees of models has been a demanding and interesting task, in particular on some real-world networks, and always attracts much concerns from different science fields, such as computer science, physics, mathematics, chemistry, and so on. Fortunately, there has been some useful methods, such as the theory of electrical networks, to find the precise solution for the number of spanning trees of special graph families, for instance grids, lattices, Sierpinski gaskets and Farey graph, see [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].
From this point, our paper is organized as follows. We will introduce some notations and definitions in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, we debate some useful network-operation to build more complex and larger graphs (models) by a series of simpler and smaller blocks. In Sec. 4, we present a method of computing the number of spanning trees. In order to understand explicitly this method and make things more pellucid, we give two examples as application of our method to spaces of trees and cycles respectively. Based on the famous Brouwer's fixed point theorem redescribed in Sec. 5, the two graph families, ladder-graphs and wheel-graphs, are put to test in the penultimate part. In the end of this paper, we make a brief summary that our method can be designed a program (algorithm) for obtaining easily the exact solutions of number of spanning trees of some models.
