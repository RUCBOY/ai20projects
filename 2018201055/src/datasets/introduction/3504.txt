The time series contains time-varying variates. Since the 1940s, the technologies of computer chips, internet of things and sensors make significant development. Nowadays, Multivariate time series (MTS) is widely spread among the process of production, monitoring, and transaction. It is various, like thermal power station [1], movement tracking [2], handwritten signature verification [3], stock trading [4], etc. MTS has many variates and there are inner relations between the variates. The traditional algorithm for data mining should be upgraded to meet the challenge from a new type of data.
Researches in multivariate time series classification become more and more popular during the past decades. It is concluded that there are two basic ways to classify the MTS. They are classification based on time instance distance and classification based on time series similarity. Two-dimensional singular value decomposition (2dSVD) took the shape and the inner relation of MTS into consideration [5]. Using echo state network and adaptive differential evolution algorithm, 18 MTS data sets were tested to prove the proposed approach effective and stable [6]. A new MTS classification named temporal discrete SVM (TDVM) was put forward, based on a temporal extension of discrete support vector machines. It could serve a better accuracy among other against algorithm [7]. Stacking which is an ensemble method was studied to process the MTS. The MTS data was decomposed into univariates. And after level 0 classifier, all univariates were collected to get a final classification. Then benchmark test showed that it worked well [8]. Glowacz investigated several feature extraction methods and different classifiers, keeping focus on the protection of DC motor. The method of selection of amplitudes of frequencies (MSAF-1, MSAF-5) [9], [10], SMOFS-25-EXPANDED [11], Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [9], [10], and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [10], [11], K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) [12], SOM (Self-organizing Map) [11] and other classifiers were tested to show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework. Furthermore, there are methods based on similarity attempt to solve the problem of MTS classification. A new DTW-based Bayesian approach was proposed to deal with sleep and wake classification, and a case study was presented to show the advantage of the proposed method [13]. Luczak had put much effort to classify MTS. Parametric derivative dynamic time warping (DDDTW) [14], parametric integral dynamic time warping (IDDTW) [15], and parametric combined dynamic time warping distance measure (combDTW) [16] proved better performance against the original dynamic time warping (DTW).
Dynamic time warping is a type of elastic algorithm which overcomes the weakness of Euclidean distance. Finding an optimal alignment between the two series is the main function of DTW. Euclidean distance measures the distance of raw data with the same time position, sequentially. With DTW, one data point could match more than one data points to minimize the cost function and find the optimal warping path. With this advantage, different length data series could be measured by DTW. DTW has a huge number of application scenes, such as speech recognition [17], hand-drawn symbol recognition [2], etc.
In Ref. [18], a modified algorithm named multi-dimensional DTW based on DTW was proposed, by extending standard DTW of univariate time series into multivariate time series area. And Euclidean distance was applied to compute the local distance between two multivariate time series. Combining the metric learning algorithm large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) and DTW, LMNN–DTW was introduced [19]. The Ref. [20] proposed a form of DTW called Derivative DTW (DDTW). The proposed algorithm measured the local derivatives of the data to find the correct warping path. Mahalanobis distance based DTW (MDDTW) was introduced to enhance the accuracy of MTS classification [21]. And a LogDet divergence based metric learning with triplet constraint (LDMLT) model is established. We call it LDMLT-MDDTW method in here. There are some practical methods to improve the efficiency of DTW, like SparseDTW [22] or FTW [23].
What’s more, the core part of data mining for MTS is distance measure (metric learning). Different distance measure has different features which may be suitable for some type of data. Usually, Euclidean distance is selected as the default distance measure in most popular algorithms. But for each MTS data set, the structure and characteristic are unique, so distance metric should be various. For example, the distance function used by original dynamic time warping (DTW) [24] algorithm is Euclidean distance, but it could be replaced by Mahalanobis distance to get a lower classification error rate [21]. The hesitant fuzzy set is a new kind of distance metric, which has rarely research on MTS classification.
As a new extension of fuzzy sets, hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) [25] have been introduced to deal with the uncertainty. HFS has attracted a lot of attention all over the world, because of efficiency in representing uncertainty. The definition, distance, similarity, and correlation for HFSs were shown in Refs. [26], [27]. In Ref. [28], the notions of hesitant fuzzy entropy and cross-entropy to tackle with the multi-attribute decision making were defined. The researchers investigated the multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) problems with hesitant fuzzy information. And they studied a model based on traditional grey relational analysis (GRA) method, with the help of HFSs [29]. In Ref. [30], a new formula of correlation coefficients between HFSs was established, extending the interval of correlation coefficient from [0, 1] to [−1, 1]. The idea of generalized hesitant fuzzy synergetic weighted distance measures was proposed in Ref. [31]. And in Ref. [32], the new formula of similarity and entropy of hesitant fuzzy sets were defined, by summarising the relationship of distance, similarity, and entropy based on hesitant fuzzy sets. The clustering algorithms for clustering the hesitant fuzzy data and two methods of application in the data mining task were discussed in Ref. [33].
From the above literature, the improved DTW algorithm focuses on changing the structure of DTW to achieve better classification accuracy. Also, the combinations of DTW with other algorithm have to learn new properties to process the different type of data. However, the distance metric still lacks in-depth study. On the other hand, the HFSs are influential in system evaluation, but there is no effective application of HFSs in classification.
In this paper, we propose an improved DTW algorithm based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFSs) to tackle with the classification of multivariate time series. In our new method, the membership degree concept from HFS is brought into MTS classification as a new distance metric. Time instance segments alignment was studied, which is rarely mentioned before. And for reaching lower error rate in MTS classification, scale constraints were built to find the most effective scale parameters. At last, comparisons against state-of-the-art algorithm were discussed, a higher accuracy in most cases and lower time-consuming with suitable scale parameters were achieved.
In the experiments, the nearest neighbor classification (1NN) was deployed to test the proposed method. 1NN classifier and DTW had been shown one of the best combinations for univariate time series classification [34], and state-of-the-art algorithms aiming at MTS classification selected the same combination [14], [15], [16], [19], [20], [21]. So we tested HFS-DTW under equally experiment environment. Also, 10-fold cross-validation technique is required to eliminate the impact of potential unbalance data.
The remained of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic notion and background information. In Section 3, an improved DTW algorithm based on hesitant fuzzy sets (HFS-DTW) is presented. Then experiments and experimental results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in Section 4. Also, suggestions for the proposed algorithm application are made. At last, the paper is concluded in Section 5.
