Recently, video surveillance systems are ubiquitously installed and are continuously generating huge amount of video data. There is information in the data which cannot possibly be reviewed with human-eye in detail in majority of the cases. So, it is important to design automatic schemes to assist users in accessing long videos other than human inspection [[33], [35]]. Visual object tracking is part of the fundamental problems in computer vision tasks. In recent years, visual tracking has been subjected to much attention, and numerous works from different perspectives in this area were reviewed [[40], [58]]. Briefly speaking, there are two major categories of tracking algorithms: generative methods [[32], [44], [50], [52]] and discriminative methods [[4], [12], [60]]. Based on the advances made by machine learning researchers, discriminative methods replaced generative methods and become the hotspots in research. Tracking algorithms based on the discriminative methods have mainly two approaches: Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) and Tracking-By-Detection. The former one has demonstrated excellent performance for visual object tracking benchmark. The latter one fuses detection and tracking algorithm of objects effectively. It can meet the requirements of long-term tracking.
The main proposals of recent tracking algorithms are about the object detection method in image processing that detects objects frame by frame. The algorithm based on this method regards object tracking as a binary classification pattern. It generates thousands of candidate regions in a single frame and extracts discriminative of these regions. Then a trained classifier is applied to determine object and background. Though satisfying results have been achieved by those algorithms, it is still a challenging job for tracking in video sequences affected by occlusion, variation of illumination, rotation and scale variation, as shown in Fig. 1. The reason is that this approach ignores the continuity of tracked object in the visual tracking process. Therefore, in order to solve the existing drawbacks and improve the tracking algorithms, we utilize the motion characteristics of the moving targets. Meanwhile, inspired by Human Visual System (HVS), we generate candidate regions through a parallel algorithm to meet the requirement of real time tracking.Download : Download high-res image (626KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

In this work, we address these two issues : (i) We present a novel strategy for visual tracking called Visual Attention Feature (VAF). Visual attention is a characteristic of human visual system which detects the relevant patches of visual fields [[54], [57]]. Comparing with visual object tracking in computer vision, the ability with capture and tracking object of human perception system has a lot of advantages with motion characteristics, especially in condition of background variation and non-rigid deformation. Considering that there are two appearance characteristics change with position and scale of the moving target in video sequences, VAF is divided into position feature and scale feature. Besides, most trackers take two stages to handle changing of position and scale. Therefore, it is a natural choice to compute VAF in parallel. (ii) We design a candidate region generating algorithm based on parallel computing. According to our experiment, general trackers propose more than 1000 candidate regions for detection. The consumed time of proposing candidate region generation is more than half of all time. Therefore, we divide the candidate regions into four sections with the same size according to the VAF, and compute four sections at the same time in parallel. Experiments show that our method deployed on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) can reduce the time consumption by 30–50%.
In this paper, we propose a novel strategy (VAF) for visual tracking and design a parallel algorithm to generate candidate region for tracker on AWS cloud platform. The main contributions of this paper are summarized below:



•
First, we address the VAF to express the motion characteristics of moving target based on the visual attention mechanism, and divide into two parts—position feature and scale feature.
•
Second, effectiveness of the VAF with visual tracking algorithm is analyzed in theory. Moreover, the computing methods of velocity, acceleration, and scale change rate in VAF are proposed. Furthermore, a novel tracking strategy which fuses VAF is addressed and it is applied into two basic tracking algorithms—DCF and Tracking-By-Detection.
•
Third, we deploy our methods onto AWS cloud platform to accelerate parallel computing of candidate region. The statistical properties of VAF in two authoritative datasets OTB-2013 [55] and VOT-2016 [25] are analyzed. We also compare our two fusion VAF improved tracking algorithms with basic algorithms on OTB-2013 benchmark. The experimental results reveal the effectiveness of the VAF. Moreover, extensive evaluation on OTB-2015 [56] shows that our methods are competitive in performance to the state-of-the-art trackers.
