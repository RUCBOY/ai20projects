The primary goal of requirements engineering (RE)1 is to elicit from a computer-based system's (CBS's) stakeholders, including its users, requirements for the CBS and to document these requirements. In order to elicit these requirements, a requirements analyst invests significant amounts of his2 time identifying the CBS's users [98], identifying use cases for each of these users [34], and identifying requirements that support these use cases [70]. A large fraction of the RE literature is devoted to describing techniques for carrying out these activities more successfully.
Weber, the first author of this paper, earned her master's degree by writing a thesis [108] under the supervision of Lank and Berry, the other authors of this paper. The thesis, titled “Privacy and Security Attitudes, Beliefs and Behaviours: Informing Future Tool Design”, first defined a privacy and security (PAS) tool as any CBS or a part thereof, that has PAS concerns or that deals with enforcing PAS. It then categorized users of PAS tools by their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors (ABBs) with respect to PAS into five categories,3
•that are believed to represent all users with any ABB with respect to PAS, including that of ignoring it, and•each of which represents the subset of the PAS tool users that approach PAS with one particular configuration of ABBs, including that of ignoring it.
