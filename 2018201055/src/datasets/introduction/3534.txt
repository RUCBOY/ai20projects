Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-destructive, non-invasive, non-intrusive, non-ionizing, and innocuous technique to acquire images. This makes MRI an alternative for determining physico-chemical and sensory parameters of meat and meat products. Several works have been carried out to determine quality parameters of dry-cured products by MRI, allowing to monitor the ripening process of Iberian [1], Parma [2] and San Daniele [3] hams. Iberian hams were classified as a function of pig feeding background [4,5] and some physico-chemical and sensory traits were predicted [6,7]. Other authors have characterized Slovenian dry-cured hams [8]. On loins, an adequate product classification as a function of pig breeding and the classification of the product in three quality degrees (low, medium and high) were carried out in Refs. [9,10], and some physico-chemical and sensory parameters were predicted in Refs. [[11], [12], [13]].
The extraction of textural information from images is very common to explore parameters related to food quality. Antequera et al. [14] applied computational texture features algorithms as a tool to predict intramuscular fat and sensory characteristics. Ávila et al. [15] analyzed marbling and fat level in Iberian loin based on texture features. Texture features algorithms were applied to study the marbling on beef [16], to predict the tenderness of cooked beef from images of fresh beef [17], or to classify bovine meat [18]. The efficiency of the computational texture features algorithms to solve problems related to meat product, in fresh and dry-cured products, have been proved [19,20]. Recently, Caballero et al. applied texture features to monitor the diffusion of salt in Iberian ham [21]. All these methods integrated matrices based on second-order statistics [4,5,14], that relate texture features and some physico-chemical and sensory attributes. Additionally, using first-order statistics, moisture, fat and salt contents were monitored with different processing methods [22].
The fractal concept studies the degree of symmetry or self-similarity found in a structure at all scales. Mainly, the use of fractals allows the identification of recurring patterns, removing the possibility of image compression [[23], [24], [25], [26]]. In recent years, there is a growing interest in the use of fractal analysis techniques. Thus, a new fractal properties algorithm is proposed in this study, since, it improves the computational complexity in comparison with the traditional one. In addition, from the point of view of the meat industry, the use of a lighter algorithm for analyzing meat products would make easier its implantation in the food processing plants as a part of a non-destructive analysis methodology.
Mainly, the fractal properties were applied to characterize the microstructure of different types of food [[27], [28], [29], [30]], microstructure of beef [31] and poultry meat [32]. In relation to the use of fractal properties to predict quality traits of food, Tsuta et al. [33] applied them to predict the sugar content of melons and Polder et al. [34] measured the chlorophyll of tomato by applying of fractal properties. However, to the best of our knowledge, two studies use analysis of fractal properties to predict quality parameters of meat products [12,35].
Regarding the data analysis, usual statistical tools such as Pearson's correlation coefficients or Principal Components Analysis (PCA) have been usually applied [4,10,14]. New advances in information technologies have made it possible to collect, store, and process massive large and complex datasets [36]. This is known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). Data mining is one of the stage in the KDD process [37], as a non-trivial process of finding knowledge and potentially useful information from data stored in repositories [38]. There are several data mining algorithms when modelling continuous data. Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) is one of the classical approaches. It models the linear relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (predictors). In food technology, MLR was applied to model wine preferences [39], to predict quality traits in beef [40] and lamb [41]. Recently, Pérez-Palacios et al. [6,13] and Caballero et al. [7,11,12,21,35] have applied MLR into Iberian meat products.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents the Materials and Methods used in this study. Section 3 describe the obtained results and their discussion. Section 4 draws the main conclusions and their implications.
This paper aims at 1) developing an algorithm for studying texture features based on fractal properties and second-order statistics and 2) comparing different image analysis algorithms and its application on MRI images in order to predict quality parameters of loins.
