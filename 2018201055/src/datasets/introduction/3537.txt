The number of global public health issues concerning sleep deficiency, media habits, obesity, and emotional problems are increasing (Cain & Gradisar, 2010). Parents, teachers, and pediatric nurses are confronted with challenging questions regarding the best approach to guide children towards a healthy lifestyle (Betz, 2014, Fogg and Johnson, 2015). At many schools, students are provided with computers, and a significant proportion of education is conducted using screens rather than traditional textbooks (Seomun et al., 2013). School-age children commonly use televisions and computers as sleep aids, but these devices have been shown to have the reverse effect (i.e., increased time to fall asleep and shorter sleep duration) (Chahal et al., 2013, Eggermont and Van den Bulck, 2006). There is a link between obesity and altered sleep quality in 10-year-old children (Pacheco et al., 2017). Many children and parents address school nurses with questions regarding sleep and wellbeing (Garmy, Nyberg, & Jakobsson, 2012). There is a need for more knowledge about insufficient sleep, obesity, and screen time amongst children so that child health professionals can provide relevant advice.
BackgroundTen-year-old children are between childhood and puberty; they still need to have a close relationship with their parents, but peers are becoming increasingly important. It is crucial to fit in and to be accepted by peers. The development for children in this age can differ considerably (Goswami, 2011). After the age of 10, the boys and girls start to diverge along different puberty trajectories that might influence sleep (Kryger, Roth, & Dement, 2017).Over the last century, the duration of sleep amongst children and adolescents has decreased by 1 h (Matricciani, Olds, & Petkov, 2012). The amount of sleep is associated with health-related quality of life (HRQL); specifically, children who sleep more have a better HRQL (Gustafsson et al., 2016). Daytime sleepiness is also associated with a lower HRQL (Gustafsson et al., 2016). The National Sleep Foundation recommends 9 to 11Â h of sleep for 6- to 13-year-olds (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). More than one-quarter of Swedish 11-year-olds report difficulties getting to sleep more than once a week (Public Health Agency, 2014).Insufficient sleep is associated with behavioral and cognitive deficits (Astill, Van der Heijden, Van IJzendoorn, & Van Someren, 2012), as well as increased frequency of being overweight (Appelhans et al., 2014, Busto-Zapico et al., 2014, Chahal et al., 2013, Danielsen et al., 2010, Magee and Hale, 2012), and the latter is a risk factor for metabolic disease in children (Dhuper, Buddhe, & Patel, 2013). The World Health Organization (WHO) study entitled Health Behaviours in School-Age Children (Inchley & Currie, 2014) found that 22% of 11-year-olds were obese or overweight.Associations between screen time and reduced sleep duration, as well as between screen time and increased sleep problems, have been reported (Burke, 2016, Chahal et al., 2013, Hale and Guan, 2015, Johansson et al., 2016). High levels of screen time are associated with hyperactivity/inattention problems, internalizing problems, impaired well-being, and a lower quality of life (Suchert, Hanewinkel, & Isensee, 2015). Approximately 50% of 11-year-old boys use a computer for e-mail, to access the Internet or for homework for two or more hours on weekdays. These figures are lower amongst girls. Furthermore, approximately two-thirds of boys play games on a computer or console for two or more hours each day (Inchley & Currie, 2014).Thus, the global trend shows that children's sleep time is decreasing (Matricciani et al., 2012, Norell-Clarke and Hagquist, 2017), whilst screen time and obesity are increasing (Inchley & Currie, 2014). To develop child health care interventions, there is a need to investigate and document the current status of childhood sleep, screen time, and obesity. The current study investigated the sleep, television/computer habits, and obesity of school-aged children in Sweden.
