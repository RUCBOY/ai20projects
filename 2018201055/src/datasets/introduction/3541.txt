Saliency object detection is a fundamental and important problem in computer vision and pattern recognition area [1], [2]. The aim of saliency detection is to identify/locate the most salient or informative region of an image that attracts human attention. The salient regions of the input image usually indicate the main objects or discriminative features contained in this image. Thus, saliency detection techniques can be widely used in many computer vision and image processing tasks such as image segmentation [3], [4], [5], object detection [6], [7], [8], image retrieval [9] and visual object tracking [10].
Recently, many models and methods have been proposed for image saliency detection problem [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Generally, these methods can be roughly categorized into three classes, i.e., bottom-up, top-down and combination of top-down and bottom-up methods [11], [12], [15], [16], [20]. The bottom-up saliency detection methods are typically unsupervised while top-down methods are generally supervised. In this paper, we focus on bottom-up methods. In the past decade, many bottom-up methods have been proposed. For example, Itti et al. [21] propose a simple visual saliency computation method for natural images. Hou and Zhang [22] propose a spectral method to estimate the saliency map of the input image. Han et al. [23] propose to use a sparse coding technique for saliency estimation. Cheng et al. [13] exploit the pixel-wise color contrast for saliency measurement. Yan et al. [24] provide a hierarchical saliency detection method by integrating the saliency cues on different scales simultaneously. Li et al. [17] formulate the visual saliency detection problem via dense and sparse reconstruction. In addition, more and more graph based models have been proposed for saliency detection in recent years. Harel et al. [25] propose a graph-based visual saliency detection method (GBVS). Gopalakrishnan et al. [26] exploit a random walk model for salient object location in an image. Jiang et al. [27] propose to use absorbing Markov chain for saliency detection problem in which the saliency value is measured by the absorbing time of transilient nodes in Markov chain. Yang et al. [28] propose to use graph manifold ranking method to compute the saliency. Zhu et al. [29] provide a general energy optimization framework to obtain a uniform saliency map by combining background and foreground cues together. Li et al. [30] propose to use a regularized random walks ranking model to achieve object saliency estimation. Wang et al. [3] present a saliency detection approach by exploiting both local graph structure and background priors. Tu et al. [31] use a minimum spanning tree (MST) model to achieve salient object detection.
In this paper, we propose a new multi-layer graph based diffusion (MLD) method for image saliency detection problem by adopting random walk with restart (RWR) model [32], [33]. Our method begins with constructing a multi-layer graph with super-pixels as nodes. Then, we perform our MLD on multi-layer graph to obtain more accurate measurements of background and foreground cues by diffusing background and foreground priors respectively. At last, we combine these two cues together to obtain more accurate saliency estimation. Our previous work on diffusion based image saliency detection has been proposed in the work [34]. Comparing with previous work, one important aspect of the proposed multi-layer diffusion model is that it can conduct diffusion of saliency cues across different layers simultaneously and cooperatively and thus can share the saliency cues across different image scales in saliency estimation. Experimental results on several benchmark databases demonstrate the effectiveness and benefit of the proposed method.
Random walk based models have been usually explored for image/video object detection and segmentation [35], [36], [37]. Different from previous works, in this paper, we propose to conduct image saliency cues diffusion by exploring RWR model and thus can obtain a kind of more reasonable background, foreground measurements for image saliency computation problem. Also, we derive a new kind of multi-layer diffusion which can conduct diffusion within each layer and between different layers simultaneously.
