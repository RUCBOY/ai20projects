A comprehensive understanding of x-ray physics is essential to a number of professional roles in healthcare including radiography, radiology, and medical physics. Therefore, its teaching forms an integral part of the training for a number of associated professional qualifications. Traditional teaching methods for delivering x-ray physics education have focussed on didactic lectures that may not be effective for a number of reasons depending on the student group. Some students have little relevant mathematics or physics education or have not engaged with this material for some time. For some student groups, interpreting and linking complex physical processes, which are often described mathematically, to real-world situations is often challenging and can lead to poor student engagement.
Demonstrating x-ray imaging physics through experimental measurements would be beneficial, but requires access to x-ray equipment which is not always available for teaching this subject, or is limited in relation to access and the number of students involved. This approach would also have radiation protection issues, requiring students to be closely monitored within a properly audited risk-assessment framework. This would clearly have an impact on the ability to deliver the teaching in this way, affecting the number of staff required, associated training, and running costs. It is often the case that work-based clinical placements support the delivery of clinical practice but not the underpinning theory, and are not always delivered in parallel, making it difficult for a student to form a clear link between theory and practice.
An alternative to direct experimentation is the use of computer simulators. Existing techniques for the simulation of x-ray imaging systems have focussed primarily on Monte Carlo (MC) methods [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. In general, these techniques are computationally expensive even when supported by graphical processing unit (GPU) acceleration [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] or when combined with deterministic calculations to speedup computation times [6,12,13]. Other deterministic methods [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]] employ ray or pencil beam tracing techniques using computed tomography (CT) volumes [[14], [15], [16], [17]] or meshes [18,[20], [21], [22]] to produce forward-projected radiographic 2D x-ray images. The majority of these MC, deterministic, or hybrid approaches are aimed at specialist applications such as x-ray system optimisation or 2D/3D image registration. These software packages often require specialist physics and computer programming knowledge to operate and interpret. Therefore, they are not well suited for general educational purposes. In addition, many of the techniques require GPU support which is not readily available on computers used by students for educational purposes. The few contributions aimed at educational applications are limited. In 2005 Fanti et al. [16] presented a simple x-ray simulation system based on pencil beam forward projections through a CT volume formed by stacking a number of slices formed by 256 pixels × 256 pixels × 1 mm wide that resulted in the final image. The image detector in this model had the same response as photographic film and not a modern digital detector. Dikshit et al. [19] presented an online interactive simulation system for medical imaging education deployed using MALAB Web Server environment. However, only a single slice CT simulator and one dimension beam x-ray attenuation model was reported. To the best of our knowledge no further developments to either of the two preceding contributions were reported. A commercially available software, Shaderware, has been available since 2006, and has seen active development since then. To our knowledge its underlying algorithms have not been described in the literature, but appears to utilise forward projection of CT volumes for its imaging.
In this study we have developed two innovative software tools to simulate many practical aspects of x-ray production, image acquisition and display. Unlike general x-ray simulators, or those used for research purposes, these tools were specifically aimed at demonstrating key learning points through an interactive environment. As such they do not attempt to simulate every aspect of a real system, only those that require demonstrating within the teaching of x-ray physics to student groups new to the subject. It is also important that the simulation operates sufficiently quickly for interactive teaching purposes (whereas a research simulator may take considerably longer to compute results). A constrained feature design enabled the simulators to operate in real-time with relatively modest computer system requirements yet retain sufficient realism within the simulation to support learning. The tools are easy to implement and deploy on standard personal computers (PCs) and employ readily available anatomical mesh libraries and physics data files. As such the tools scale well with student numbers and represent a much more economical approach compared with commercially available alternatives, albeit with reduced features and complexity. Operating the tools do not require specialist programming skills and, due to the modular nature of the computer code, are easily updated and extended to incorporate additional features. The delivery of x-ray physics teaching through this innovative and accessible method will allow students to understand the theory and relationship with clinical practice thereby developing a deeper understanding of the subject. In summary, the developed software tools provide a novel learning environment that is easily deployable and does not require any special training or knowledge on the part of the student. Though sacrificing some realism, the tools clearly demonstrates key principles of x-ray production and imaging.
