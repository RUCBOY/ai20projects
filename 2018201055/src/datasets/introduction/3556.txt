Breast cancer occurs in the highest frequency in women among all cancers, and is also one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide [1], [2]. Scientists do not definitely know what causes breast cancer yet, and only know some risk factors that can increase the likelihood of developing breast cancer: getting older, genetics, radiation exposure, dense breast tissue, alcohol consumption, etc. The key of reducing the mortality is to find signs and symptoms of breast cancer at its early stage by clinic examination [3]. Breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging has become one of the most important and effective modality for the early detection of breast cancer because of its noninvasive, nonradioactive and cost-effective nature [4]; and it is most suitable for large-scale breast cancer screening and diagnosis in low-resource countries and regions.
Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems based on B-mode breast ultrasound have been developed to overcome the considerable inter- and intra-variabilities of the breast cancer diagnosis, and have been clinically tested their ability to improve the performance of the breast cancer diagnosis. BUS segmentation, extracting tumor region of a BUS image, is a crucial step for a BUS CAD system. Base on the segmentation results, quantitative features will be calculated to describe tumor shape, size, echo pattern, etc., and be input into a classifier to determine the category of the tumors. Therefore, the precision of BUS segmentation directly affects the performance of the quantitative analysis and diagnosis of tumors. Segmentation is a common and crucial task in medical image analysis, and many medical image segmentation tasks share essentially similar segmentation approaches; however, comparing with medical image segmentation for other imaging modalities, e.g., computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), mammography, BUS image segmentation is very challenging because (1) ultrasound image has very low quality due to the speckle noise, low contrast, low single noise ratio (SNR) and artifacts; (2) large variations of breast structures exists among patients, which make it difficult to apply the knowledge of anatomical structures; and (3) strong priors based on tumor shape, size and echo strength are important for organ segmentation [174], [180] in other imaging modalities; but these features vary largely across patients and are difficult to be applied to BUS image segmentation.
Automatic BUS segmentation has been studied extensively in the last two decades. We can classify existing approaches into semi-automated and fully automated groups according to the degree of human intervention involved in segmentation process. In most semi-automated methods, radiologist needs to specify a region of interest (ROI) including the lesion, a seed in the lesion, or an initial boundary. Fully automated segmentation approaches need no user intervention, and usually model the knowledge of breast ultrasound and oncology as the prior constraints. Many segmentation techniques were employed in both semi-automatic and fully automatic approaches.
Huang et al. [175] is the first survey paper for BUS image segmentation published recently; however, this paper is much more comprehensive in terms of major issue discussions, future direction prediction, theory fundamentals, application theme and the number of references. In this paper, we classify breast cancer segmentation approaches into six main categories: (1) graph-based approaches [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [22], [23], [24], [25], [27], [28], [32], [33], [34], (2) deformable models [42], [50], [52], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [67], [69], [71], [73], [75], [76], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [85], [124], [139], [148], [166], (3) learning-based approaches [7], [9], [10], [87], [89], [91], [94], [95], [98], [100], [103], [104], [105], [106], [107], [120], (4) thresholding [22], [109], [110], [111], [112], [113], [114], [115], (5) region growing [54], [55], [113], [117], [118], and (6) watershed [109], [122], [123], [126], [127], [128]. As shown in Fig. 1, the first three categories dominate BUS image segmentation approaches; and the last three categories are the classical image processing approaches. The category of the others [136], [138], [139], [140], [142], [143], [144], [145], [146] is composed of three small sub-categories, each contains only few literatures. Due to the challenging nature of the task, just using single image processing technique cannot achieve desirable results; and most successful approaches employ hybrid techniques and model biological priors.Download : Download high-res image (336KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, the fundamental issues in BUS segmentation are discussed, e.g., denoising, interaction, biological priors modeling, validation, and the possible problem-solving strategies; in Sections 3–6, we review automatic BUS image segmentation methods by presenting the principle of each category, discussing their advantages and disadvantages, and summarizing the most valuable strategies. In Section 7, we discuss the approaches of three sub-categories briefly. Section 8 gives the conclusion and the future directions.
