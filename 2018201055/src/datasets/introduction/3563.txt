Network immunization is a very hot topic in the field of complex networks [1], [2]. Lots of studies have proposed several strategies from the viewpoint of transmission dynamics and structural dynamics [3], [4], [5]. Generally speaking, an effective network strategy can restrain virus propagation through protecting a set of important nodes and blocking propagation paths. In order to estimate the performance of network immunization strategies, some universal simulation platforms are used to simulate a propagation process and compare the efficiency of immunization strategies in terms of the scale and speed of such propagation [6]. Therefore, the core work of network immunization strategy is to find out a set of important nodes which can effectively block propagation paths and further restrain the propagation.
Existing immunization strategies aim to find out a set of important nodes from the viewpoint of a network structure. These strategies believe that the function of a node in a network is determined by its location. Therefore, lots of strategies are proposed based on the topological feature of a network, such as degree-based strategies [7], [8], betweenness-based strategies [6], [9], and k-core-based strategies [10], [11]. Although more than one feature of a network has been taken into consideration for designing a network immunization strategy [12], the immunized nodes selected by such a strategy are still based on the whole topological feature of the network.
However, more and more researches have found that a propagation in a network is also related to dynamic features of nodes [6], [13]. More specifically, the dynamic feature of a node can affect both the scope and speed of a propagation. For example, the mobile virus propagation and the rumor spreading in a social network are activated by individual operational behaviors [14], [15]. Their propagations are affected by both individual behaviors and topological structures of networks. In order to investigate the relationship between the dynamic feature of individual behavior and a propagation, more and more propagation models are proposed as platforms to simulate human-involved propagation processes [16]. From these models, we can conclude that dynamic features of nodes in a network are heterogeneous, which can affect the scope and speed of a propagation. Therefore, it is necessary to design a new immunization strategy considering the topological feature of a network and the heterogeneous features of nodes.
In this paper, we aim to propose a new network immunization strategy in which the importance of a node is determined by both its location in a network and dynamic activities within the node. Here activities of a node can be denoted as individual behaviors in the domain of email worm propagation and rumor spreading in computer and social networks, respectively. Specifically, our simulations are implemented in single-layer networks, rather than networks with multi-layer structures, such as multiplex and interdependent networks [17], [18]. However, our proposed strategy can be easily extended to multiplex and interdependent networks through combining the multi-layer structural features of networks with activities of nodes.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the preliminary of our work and Section 3 formulates our proposed method. Comprehensive experiments are implemented in Section 4 in order to estimate the performance of our proposed strategy and compare it with others. Section 5 concludes our contribution.
