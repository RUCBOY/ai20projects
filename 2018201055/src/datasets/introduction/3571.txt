Human detection is an important aspect of computer vision with vast application areas including event monitoring systems, suspicious event detection, traffic flow measurement, counting human in the crowd, automotive safety and intelligent control. Detecting human in video surveillance system also plays a vital role in fighting crime and protecting public property. Video surveillance is a valuable aid to improve community safety by monitoring important crowded places such as town and city centers, industrial parks, hospitals and universities for early identification of crime and other disruptive incidents. However, with large scale implementation of video surveillance systems manually tracking each camera to identify suspicious events is not possible. Detecting humans in the robust environment is the fundamental process for suspicious event detection. Therefore, we propose a framework for human detection in various poses, appearances, under uneven illuminations and occlusion.
