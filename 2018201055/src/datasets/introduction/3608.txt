To understand and analyze a phenomenon or to anticipate the expected results, several means and tools have been used for long. Among these means and tools, we can cite the following:



•
Replacing humans by animals: this consists in finding the animal populations whose behaviors are similar to human behaviors with respect to a given phenomenon. Many pressure groups are fighting against this practice.
•
Maneuvers: for example for the military, they play two opposing forces (the white against the black) on a real course with real hardware but without using live ammunition.
•
Mock-up: this consists in building a copy with small scale and testing it.
•
Equation: there are many examples which have been used by pupils and students in courses of physics, chemistry, etc. This simulation can be used only with simple phenomena.
