Query complexity has been very useful to study the relative power of quantum computation and classical computation [7], [15]. According to their output, query algorithms can be studied either in the bounded-error setting (the algorithm gives the correct result with probability at least 2/3) or in the exact setting (the algorithm gives the correct result with certainty). For the bounded-error case, there are many algorithms achieving large separation in query complexities (for example, [1], [9]), and some of them have exponential or even larger speedups for computing partial functions ([17] includes a more detailed list), though it is not known whether the separation is optimal for some of them.
As for exact query complexity, the result is more limited. For total functions, Ambainis [2] gave the first superlinear speedup example, and the best known separation is O˜(n) versus Ω(n2) [3], which computes a variant of functions introduced in [10]. In fact, it has been proved that the quantum query algorithms can only achieve polynomial speedup with degree at most 3 [13]. However, for computing partial functions, there can be an exponential or larger separation, and the first example is the well-known Deutsch–Jozsa problem [8], whose separation is 1 versus n/2+1. In [17], the optimal separation for a generalized Deutsch–Jozsa problem was given, which is over exponential one as well.
Simon's problem [18] is a famous computational problem that achieves exponential separation in query complexities. In the bounded-error setting, Simon gave an elegant quantum algorithm which solves the problem with O(n) queries and the physical realization has demonstrated its efficiency [19]. The Ω(n) lower bound was also proved in [11] using polynomial method [4]. On the other hand, the classical probabilistic query complexity for this problem is Θ(2n) [20], which shows that the Θ(n) versus Θ(2n) separation is an optimal one.
As for the exact query complexities of Simon's problem, Brassard and Høyer [5] combined Simon's algorithm with two post-processing subroutines to ensure that their algorithm solves the problem exactly, which also requires O(n) queries. However, their algorithm is quite complicated and involved. Mihara and Sung [14] proposed a simpler exact algorithm, but their algorithm relies on some non-standard query oracles and they did not show the construction of their oracles. Moreover, the Ω(n) quantum query lower bound is a direct corollary of previous bounded-error lower bound result. For the classical case, the Ω(2n) lower bound can be easily obtained (Theorem 6). As we are aware, it was not known (until this point) whether this lower bound is a tight one, so it was not known (until this point) whether the O(n) versus Ω(2n) is optimal either.
In this paper, we propose a new exact quantum algorithm for solving Simon's problem also with O(n) queries, which is much simpler and more concrete than Brassard and Høyer's algorithm [5] and does not rely on some non-standard query oracles as Mihara and Sung's construction [14]. Our algorithm directly combines Simon's algorithm with the quantum amplitude amplification technique [6] to ensure we get an exact result. Then, we design a classical deterministic algorithm for solving Simon's problem with O(2n) queries, which relies on some crucial insights about the bitwise exclusive-or operation results of the pairs of strings which are queried by the algorithm. Thus, we prove the Θ(2n) classical deterministic query complexity for Simon's problem. With previously established results on the exact quantum query complexity, we can get the optimal separation in the exact query complexities for Simon's problem: Θ(n) versus Θ(2n).
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review Simon's problem, describe the Simon's algorithm [18] with a different way, and present some notions and notations that will be used hereinafter. Then in Section 3, we discuss the quantum query complexity of Simon's problem and give a new exact quantum algorithm to solve Simon's problem also with O(n) queries. After that, in Section 4, we discuss the classical query complexity of Simon's problem and design a classical deterministic algorithm for solving Simon's problem with O(2n) queries. Finally, conclusions are summarized in Section 5.
