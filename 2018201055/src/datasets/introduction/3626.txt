Saliency detection focuses on separating the most salient objects/regions from background in images or videos [1], which is different from the conventional image-segmentation algorithms. Essentially, saliency detection tries to reveal and model the visual attention mechanism of Human Visual System (HVS) for perceiving salient objects or regions in a neurobiological way [2], [3]. Currently, a plenty of saliency detection models have been designed, which have been extended to various computer-vision and multimedia applications. Among them, typical applications include object detection [4], [5], [6], [8], traffic congestion analysis [7], [8], facial analysis [9], [10], underwater vision [36], [37], health prediction [51], [52], [53], visual prediction [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], activity recognition [62], [63], image retrieval [64], [65], [66], [67], [68] and so on.
Over the past few decades, although the research of saliency detection has attracted wide attentions of scientists from different disciplines such as neurobiology, physiology of vision, cognitive psychology, and computer vision, reliably modeling the mechanism of visual selective attention still remains a challenge and an open issue, especially for the images under complex scenes and without prior knowledge in advance.
Compared to these previous works, in this paper, we mainly focus on simulating how the human visual system (HVS) utilizes perception-directional visual stimuli to locate the most salient object in an image from the perspective of neurobiological perception. In our proposed framework, we first concentrate on designing a perceptual directional patch detector, based on discrete wavelet frame transform (DWFT) and sparsity criterion, to mimic how cortical cells that in the HVS utilize visual directional cues to detect salient objects in a computational way. Furthermore, the proposed perceptual directional patch detector can be applied universally, which is independent of image contents and no need of prior knowledge of image scenes. After locating the salient object, we also proposed an efficient local color contrast method, which is named principal local color contrast (PLCC) to calculate the color contrast between the salient object and the background rapidly. In contrast to traditional local color contrast methods, which require computing local contrast similarity over the entire image pixel by pixel leading to huge computational consumption. Our devised PLCC can not only soften and formulate principal local color contrast as a binary classification computation to avoid the NP-hard problem, but also has the ability to differentiate salient objects from complex background. Experiments are carried out on three publicly available image databases to evaluate the proposed model. And the comparison results have shown that the proposed method is effective and reliable for saliency detection.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will describe the related work about saliency detection. In Section 3, we will introduce the proposed saliency-detection model in detail. Experimental results are presented in Section 4. The paper closes with a conclusion and discussion in Section 5.
