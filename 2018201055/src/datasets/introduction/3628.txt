Today, the use of information technology in the healthcare has potential benefits for collecting, processing and retrieval of information and for using it in clinical and managerial decision making. Different companies design health information systems and their designs often do not conform to users’ needs and to the knowledge of healthcare professionals [[1], [2], [3]]. This impedes the adoption of these systems in the real work environment. In addition, improper design of these systems results in user resistance, error generation, and increased time and cost [4]. These problems lead to patient safety issues in mission critical systems such as Emergency Information System (EIS). Several studies have reported the errors resulted from poor design of healthcare software [[1], [2], [3]]. Many of these errors are related to usability problems that adversely affect users’ interaction with a system [5,6]. Therefore, evaluating the usability of these systems can reveal these problems, help to redesign systems, reduce time and cost, and increase the willingness of users to use these systems. Usability is associated with concepts including system ease of use, usefulness and userinteraction design which are important for both group of users and experts evaluating this attribute of a system [7,8]. One of the easiest and widely used methods for identifying usability problems by experts is Heuristic Evaluation (HE) [9,10,11]. In addition, HE can identify major usability problems of a system [12]. In this method, the evaluators independently examine the design of the user interface of a system against a set of principles and identify the violation of the principles as usability problems [4,11,13,14]. According to Nielsen [13], three to five expert usability evaluators can identify an average of 74% to 87% of the problems. Given the wide range of problems identified, the results of such methods would be effective if the real users of the evaluated systems acknowledge the occurrence of the problems in real working situations. Experts in heuristic evaluations may focus more on ease of use and best practices for design and the actual system users on the usefulness of systems [14]. Several studies used HE to address usability problems of information systems in the healthcare domain including the subsystems of Hospital Information System, such as Laboratory Information System [15], Radiotherapy Information System [9], Radiology Information System [15], and Electronic Health Record [16,17]. In these studies [9,15,16], the usability problems have been identified by HE but their occurrence in the real environment has not been investigated. A number of studies addressed this issue by comparing the results of HE with other types of evaluation methods. Most of these studies [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]], compared the results of this method with the results of user testing and cognitive walkthrough and interviews with users [27]. The HE and the end-user testing are designed to capture different perspectives and sometimes may occur at different stages in the systems life cycle. The HE method relies on a series of predetermined principles and examines the degree to which the design of a system complies with these principles, while the user testing and cognitive walkthrough method are task-based methods and identify the problems that users may face when completing a predetermined scenario. Therefore, HE may identify some of the problems that really affect users’ interaction but are not covered by the scenarioes used in a user testing. In addition, the user testing method has problems such as high costs, difficulty of recruiting real users, requiring substantial time and revealing a limited number of problems related to a specific scenario [4,28,29]. Moreover, complete control of all confounding factors is not possible with this method [30,31]. In order to determine whether the problems identified by the HE are experienced by users in the real environment, this study aimed to examine the extent of the users agreement with the problems identified by heuristic evaluation. Due to the importance of the emergency information system in the patients’ health and the effect of its user interface on the users’ interaction with this system, this study was conducted on an emergency information system.
