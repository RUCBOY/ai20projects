Relative to non-Hispanic White peers, Hispanic students in the U.S. have underperformed in mathematics for decades (Clements & Sarama, 2011; Denton & West, 2002; National Center for Educational Statistics, 2015; Natriello, McDill, & Pallas, 1990). Hispanic students are at increased risk for low academic achievement due to high rates of poverty (Lopez & Velasco, 2011) and lower rates of preschool enrollment (Barnett, Carolan, & Fitzgerald, & Squires, 2011; Figueras-Daniel & Barnett, 2013; Kena et al., 2016) than peers from similar economic backgrounds. Some also argue that low levels of English language proficiency among Hispanic children learning Spanish and English (i.e., Hispanic dual language learners) is at least partially responsible for these children's low rates of ‘academic success’ in the U.S. (Galindo, 2010). Given the experiential gaps to acquire English proficiency and that ‘academic success’ in the U.S. will probably continue to be defined as achievement on standardized tests administered in English despite the growing embracement of dual language instruction in some states, there is a pressing need to identify mathematics programs that promote mathematics competencies in Spanish and English among Hispanic dual language learners (DLLs). Therefore, the present study examines the impact of a numeracy intervention when used with Hispanic DLLs and considers the effect of vocabulary on kindergarten mathematics outcomes.
