An electroencephalogram (EEG) is composed of many frequency components. Without outside stimulus, the phase of each component is random. When there is a repetitive stimulus, such as a flicker in the field of vision, the EEG components that correspond to the stimulus frequency and its harmonics are strengthened. These components are termed the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Since its discovery, the SSVEP has been used in many fields [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. One important application is to study the process of a cognitive task of long duration [6], [7], [8], where an SSVEP of a particular frequency is used as a carrier wave [9] and the cognitive task modulates the amplitude and phase of the SSVEP. From studying the variance of the amplitude and phase of the SSVEP, the process of a cognitive task can be indirectly understood. In this type of application, it is easy to extract the SSVEP because of the long duration.
Different types of brain-computer interface (BCI) were produced in the last decades [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], which can control different devices using the electric signal generated by the brain. Another important application of SSVEP is to build an SSVEP-based BCI system [12], [13], [14], [15]. In this type of study, a large number of buttons are typically positioned in front of subjects, and within each button, there is a certain frequency flicker. When the subjects desire to press a button, they only stare at the button for a few seconds, and the computer analyses the EEG and extracts the SSVEP. The intention of the subjects can be decoded by recognizing the SSVEP frequency. In order to apply SSVEP-based BCI in real-time scenarios, it will be necessary to improve the information transfer rate (ITR) [16], [17], [18], [19], [20].
Many methods have been proposed that are aimed at improving the ITR of SSVEP-based BCI. Some methods make use of a statistical characterization to extract the SSVEP [21], [22], [23]. In 2007, the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) method was introduced to recognize the SSVEP frequency [24], and it has been the most popular method in use until now. In order to identify a more valid reference signal in the CCA, some improved CCA methods have been proposed, including the multi-set CCA and the multi-way CCA [25], [26]. Further, we proposed a method called the stability coefficient (SC) method in which the stability of the SSVEP was used as an indicator [27]. In other works, researchers have considered phase as an indicator of an SSVEP [28], [29]. Another widely used method of detection of dominant SSVEP frequency is the power spectrum (PS) method [3], [5], [13], [14], [15]. In this method, the relative power of a particular frequency is often used as an indicator of an SSVEP. In fact, the relative power can be viewed as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in a specific frequency band. Based on the relative power of a certain frequency in a spontaneous EEG, we first establish the threshold of the corresponding SSVEP. Then, in the detection stage, it is possible to conclude that the EEG includes the target if the relative power of that frequency exceeds its threshold. This method is based on the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and is easy to apply. When the PS method is used to detect an SSVEP in a short duration, such as 1 s, a high detection accuracy can be attained if the SSVEP is sufficiently strong and has high SNR. However, in cases where the SNR is low, the detection accuracy is also very low. Therefore, many works that employ the PS method [14], [19] use durations as long as 2–5 s. This limits the ITR, and consequently, the real-time features of the BCI are also limited. In order to apply the PS method over a short duration, the EEG containing the SSVEP should be preprocessed. The purpose of this work is to describe the necessary preprocessing in more detail.
In order to improve the SSVEP detection accuracy of the PS method over a short duration, it is necessary to first improve the SNR of the SSVEP before computing the SSVEP power. As is commonly known, the widely-used superposition method can significantly improve the SNR of an ordinary event-related potential (ERP). In an ERP experiment, an event should normally emerge many times, and it can evoke corresponding response in each trial. Researchers hypothesize that the ERP in each trial is almost the same, and is phase-locked to the event. Although the ERP in each trial is weak compared to the background EEG, the phase-locked ERP can be strengthened and the background noise cancelled by averaging the EEG in each trial. As a result, this method can significantly improve the SNR. This averaging method for extracting the ERP is called the superposition method, and has been widely adopted. According to the accepted definition, an SSVEP is not an ERP. However, applying the superposition method to extract the SSVEP over a long duration is very effective because it allows a clear signal similar to a sinusoidal wave to be ascertained in the time domain. In a real-time SSVEP-based BCI system, detection of dominant SSVEP frequency should ideally have a short duration. However, applying the superposition method directly to extract the SSVEP when the time duration is short results in poor SNR.
In order to utilize the superposition method for detection of dominant SSVEP frequency over a short duration, the evoked EEG containing the SSVEP must be preprocessed. We consider the evoked EEG to have two parts: background noise and SSVEP; further, the SSVEP can be seen as a sinusoidal signal in the EEG [6], [27]. In mathematics, a series of sinusoidal signals with the same frequency and intensity but different initial phases can be synchronized into a series of sinusoidal signals with the same frequency, intensity, and initial phase by applying mathematical computations. This synchronization process is called as reconstructing. Then the reconstructed signals are superposed. After reconstructing and superposing, it results in a new EEG segment with a high SNR. When applying the PS method on this new segment, a high detection accuracy can be achieved. The reconstruction technique introduced above is proposed in this work for the first time. When combined with the superposition method and the computation of the PS, the entire method is referred to as the reconstruction extraction (RE) method.
In order to evaluate the validity of the RE method, the RE, PS, and CCA methods were used to detect targets in evoked EEG segments of 1s length that contained SSVEPs of 6.25, 8.33, 12.5, 16.67, 25, and 33.33 Hz, respectively. In SSVEP-based multi-target BCI, we need to check every target frequency to confirm whether it exceeds its threshold within each detection duration. To accomplish this, two types of detection are defined, namely Type I detection and Type II detection. Type I detection shows whether the SSVEP can be detected correctly from a segment containing a known repetitive frequency. Type II detection shows whether other frequencies in use in the system can also be detected in the same segment. Accordingly, Type I errors can be referred to as ‘misses’, and Type II errors can be referred to as ‘false alarms’. The results show that the detection accuracy of the RE is similar to that of the CCA in any situation, and higher than the PS in situations with a low strength SSVEP. Compared to the CCA, the RE has reasonable performance even when using only one signal electrode. This suggests that the RE method may have advantages when applied in a real-time SSVEP-based BCI system.
