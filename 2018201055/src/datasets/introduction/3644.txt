The chemostat is the best laboratory idealization of nature for population studies. It is a dynamic system with continuous material inputs and outputs. The input and removal of nutrient is similar to the continuous turnover of nutrients in nature. The washout of organisms is equivalent to non-age specific death, predation or emigration which always occurs in nature [1]. Smith and Waltman [2] described the chemostat model in detail and introduced various mathematical methods for analyzing chemostat models. The theoretical investigation of the chemostat model was initiated by the works [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], etc.
It is natural that storage and conversion of nutrients by microorganisms must take into account the effect of time delay. In the chemostat, the use of ordinary differential equations carries the implication that changes occur instantaneously, so this is an inadequacy of the model. Therefore, the chemostat model with time delay can more clearly reflect the fact that the absorption of nutrients by microorganisms is not instantaneous, which is more realistic. Generally speaking, the delayed differential equations can exhibit much more complex dynamics than differential equations without delay. It is due to the fact that time delay can cause a stable equilibrium to become unstable [8]. Therefore it is interesting to investigate the system which can be described by the delayed differential equation.
Bush and Cook [9] investigated the growth of one organism in a chemostat with a delay term that reflected the delay between consumption and growth. As a consequence there is a delay in the growth equation but no delay in the consumption term in the nutrient equation. Based on this, many authors have introduced the deterministic chemostat model with general uptake functions and considered delays in uptake conversion, the model takes the following form: (1.1)S′(t)=D(S0−S(t))−∑i=1npi(S(t))xi(t),xi′(t)=−Dxi(t)+e−Dτipi(S(t−τi))xi(t−τi),i=1,2,…,n.

In model (1.1), xi(t),i=1,2,…,n, denote the concentration of the ith population of microorganisms at time t; S(t) denotes the concentration of substrate at time t; S0 denotes the concentration of substrate in the feed bottle; D denotes the input rate from the feed bottle containing the substrate and the wash-out rate of substrate, microorganisms and byproducts from the growth chamber; pi(S),i=1,2,…,n, are the species-specific per capita nutrient uptake functions; τi,i=1,2,…,n, are the species-specific time delay in nutrient conversion. Ellermeyer [10] and Wolkowicz [11] studied system (1.1) with general monotone uptake functions. Yuan [12], El-Owaidy [13] and Wang [14] considered model (1.1) with general nonmonotone uptake functions.
Based on system (1.1), a simple deterministic delayed chemostat model with nonmonotone uptake function is as follows, (1.2)S′(t)=(S0−S(t))D−mS(t)x(t)(a+S(t))(b+S(t)),x′(t)=−Dx(t)+e−DτmS(t−τ)x(t−τ)(a+S(t−τ))(b+S(t−τ)),where p(S(t))=mS(t)(a+S(t))(b+S(t)) denotes the inhibition type growth functional response which is considered in [14], and m>0 is the maximal growth rate and a>0,b>0 are constants. By using the results of [14], we know that dynamics of model (1.2) is completely determined by the break-even concentrations λ and μ, and they satisfy the equation mλ̃(a+λ̃)(b+λ̃)=DeDτ and λ<μ. If S0<λ<μ, there only exists the washout equilibrium P0=(S0,0) and it is globally asymptotically stable; If λ<S0<μ, then P0 is unstable and there exists a globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium Pλ=(λ,e−Dτ(S0−λ))≜(S∗,x∗); If λ<μ<S0, then system (1.2) admits three nonnegative equilibrium points, namely, P0, Pλ, Pμ, where Pμ=(μ,e−Dτ(S0−μ)), and P0 and Pλ are both locally asymptotically stable. This means that the bistability in the chemostat model (1.2) is possible, and the bistability depends on the initial conditions. This phenomenon never happens in the case when the uptake functions are monotone.
On the other hand, population systems are often subject to environmental noise. A realistic system will not persist at such a steady-state since it is affected by the environmental noise which will disturb this point either by directly acting on the density or by indirectly affecting the parameter values [15]. Note that the chemostat models are always affected by the environmental noise, which is an important component in an ecosystem. Therefore it is necessary to reveal how the environmental noise affects the chemostat models. Making use of stochastic models can obtain more real benefits and can predict the future dynamics of system accurately. For better understanding the dynamics of chemostat models, many authors have introduced stochastic perturbations into the deterministic chemostat models or other mathematical biology models [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. For instance, Xu and Yuan [16] studied a stochastic model with Monod growth functional response; Wang [17] proposed a stochastic chemostat model with periodic washout rate; Zhao [18] analyzed the critical parameter λ˜ which is identified as the break-even concentration in a single-species stochastic chemostat model; Imhof and Walcher [19] introduced a stochastic chemostat model for a single microbe species consuming a single nutrient; Leng etc.[20] proposed a new nonlinear stochastic SIVS epidemic model with double epidemic hypothesis and Lévy jumps; Liu etc. [21] explored an impulsive stochastic infected predator–prey system with Lévy jumps and delays; Meng etc. [22] intended to develop a new method to obtain the threshold of an impulsive stochastic chemostat model with saturated growth rate in a polluted environment; Sun and Zhang [23] proposed and investigated a stochastic delayed chemostat model with nutrient storage. However, there is little study on asymptotic behavior of a stochastic chemostat model with time delay.
Motivated by the above works, based on model (1.2), similar to the method of including stochastic perturbations of [29], [30], [31], [32], we assume that stochastic perturbations are of the white noise type which are directly proportional to S(t) and x(t), influenced on the Ṡ(t) and ẋ(t) in system (1.2). Then corresponding to system (1.2), the stochastic chemostat model with time delay can be expressed as follows (1.3)dS(t)=S0−S(t)D−mS(t)x(t)(a+S(t))(b+S(t))dt+σ1S(t)dB1(t),dx(t)=−Dx(t)+e−DτmS(t−τ)x(t−τ)(a+S(t−τ))(b+S(t−τ))dt+σ2x(t)dB2(t),where B1(t) and B2(t) are mutually independent standard Brownian motions defined on a complete probability space (Ω,ℱ,P) with a filtration {ℱt}t≥0 satisfying the usual conditions (i.e., it is increasing and right continuous while ℱ0 contains all P-null sets ), σ1 and σ2 denote the intensities of the white noise and σi>0(i=1,2).
The initial conditions of system (1.3) are (1.4)S(θ)=ϕ1(θ),x(θ)=ϕ2(θ),(ϕ1,ϕ2)∈C,where C is the continuous functions space C([−τ,0];R+2) , and R+2={(x1,x2)∈R2:xi>0,i=1,2}.
Since the washout equilibrium and positive equilibrium of deterministic model (1.2) are not the equilibria of stochastic delayed system (1.3) any more, therefore it is necessary to study the asymptotic behavior of the solutions of stochastic delayed system (1.3).
In order to prove how the environmental noise affects a microbial population in the chemostat, and to reveal the effects of time delay on the persistence of the microorganism by computer simulations. So, this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we show that there is a unique global positive solution of system (1.3) with the initial value (1.4). In Section 3, we study asymptotic behavior of stochastic delay system (1.3) around the equilibrium P0 of deterministic model (1.2) under S0<λ<μ, D>e−DτmS0ab, σ12<D and σ22<D. In Section 4, we discuss that asymptotic behavior of stochastic delay system (1.3) around the equilibrium Pλ of deterministic model (1.2) under λ<S0<μ, D<e−DτmS∗S0(a+b+S∗), σ12<D and σ22<D2. Finally, numerical simulations are present to illustrate the main results, and some conclusions are given.
