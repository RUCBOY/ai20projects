Radiotherapy has the advantage of being able to preserve form and function and therefore has great potential as a method for treating malignant tumors of the orofacial region, however, post-irradiation complications involving the surrounding tissue remain such as mucosal weakening, soft tissue fibrosis, salivary gland disorders. Radiotherapy prostheses and the close collaboration of radiotherapists and maxillofacial prosthodontists have resulted in better treatment results and fewer complications [1]. Complications such as cataracts and loss of vision could occur when radiation beam is directed to the eye in case of eyelid tumor. The combination of radiotherapy and radiotherapy prostheses is important for preventing these complications. The lead shield is applied to protect the normal surrounding structures. Open-eye impression technique is needed if customized lead eye shields to be used [2,3]. However, some scanners can now be used to digitize not only the facial surface but also eye surface [4,5]. This case report described the non-contact impression of eye surface and fabrication of customized acrylic coated lead internal eye shields.
