There are a variety of applications in which there is an interest in ranking a set of items using paired comparison data (David, 1988). Historically, psychological models of choice have played a key role, laying the foundations of the field and describing the structure in-which preference among objects are reflected by the choice probabilities of subjects [21], [53], [55]. Today there is a large body of literature on paired comparisons in fields as diverse as psychology [13], [41], social choice theory (Saari, 1995), statistics (Marden, 1996), economics [5], [15] and computer science (Furnkranz & Hullermeier, 2011). Concrete examples include the ranking of chess players and other competitive athletes [25], [27], the evaluation of political candidates (Pacuit, 2012), preference aggregation problems (Ailon, Charikar, & Newman, 2008), recommendation systems (Cremonesi, Koren, & Turrin, 2010) and many more. It is worth mentioning that models for paired comparisons are also related to the class of Fechnerian Models see [18], [19].
Axiomatic approaches have played an important role in the literature on paired comparisons and ranking. For example, axiomatic studies of preferences over random lotteries, which provide the foundations of expected utility theory, have received considerable attention in economics, e.g., Blavatskyy (2008), Dagsvik (2005), Neumann and Morgenstern (1944) and Ryan (2017). Rank-aggregation problems, which arise in artificial intelligence and social choice theory [3], [17] have also been studied from an axiomatic perspective where the focus has been on providing impossibility theorems, in the spirit of Arrow’s Theorem, as well as the classification of ranking methods in terms of the properties which they satisfy. Our study is more closely related to that of [14], [15] and Köbberling (2006) where minimal conditions for expressing a preference relation using a real-valued utility function are provided. In particular the results of Latta (1979) are considerably extended in a similar spirit as Ryan (2016) and Tversky and Russo (1969).
Formally, let J be a set of items, we will refer to the elements of J as i,j and k. We write i⪰j when item i is preferred over item j. A preference relation is a transitive binary relation (Davey & Priestly, 2002); where transitivity means that when i⪰j and j⪰k then i⪰k. We will also assume that preferences over J are complete, that is for all i,j∈J either i⪰j or j⪰i or both. This implies that any set of items i1,i2,…∈J can be ordered or ranked, possibly with ties.
Let Yij∈{0,1} denote the binary, random, outcome of a comparison between items i and j, where if Yij=1 if item i is chosen, and 0 otherwise. Let pij=P(Yij=1) be the probability that item i is chosen over item j. The collection of labeled choice probabilities associated with J is PJ={pij:(i,j)∈J×J}. There are various ways of defining a preference relation using choice probabilities. We will say that i⪰j when pij≥pji, i≻j when pij>pji and i∼j when pij=pji. Since, by assumption, pij+pji=1, then i⪰j if and only if pij≥1∕2, and, furthermore, it implies that pii=1∕2 for all i∈J. This definition guarantees that preferences over J are complete but not necessarily transitive. There are many ways of obtaining transitivity of preferences by imposing specific constraints on the choice probabilities. Traditionally these are referred to as stochastic transitivity axioms or relations (Fishburn, 1973), although strictly speaking transitivity axioms simply specify different statistical models (Cavagnaro & Davis-Stober, 2014). Here, three such axioms, namely A1, A2 and A3 are studied. These impose increasingly more stringent constraints on triplets of choice probabilities pij,pjk and pik. We start with a few definitions. A composition rule is a function H that maps (0,1)×(0,1) to [0,1]. A composition rule is said to be strictly-monotone if 1>x>y>0 then H(x,z)≥H(y,z) for all z∈(0,1) and if H(x,z)∈(0,1) then H(x,z)>H(y,z)⟺x>y. A composition rule is said to be symmetric if H(x,y)=H(y,x) for all x,y∈(0,1).

A1 (Weak Stochastic Transitivity): If pij≳pji and pjk≳pkj then pik≳pki.

A2 (Strong Stochastic Transitivity): If pij≳pji and pjk≳pkj then pik≳max{pij,pjk}.

A3 (Stochastic Transitivity by Composition): There exists a strictly-monotone and symmetric composition rule H such that pik=H(pij,pjk).
The symbol ≳ in A1 and A2 is either a weak, ≥, or a strong, >, inequality. The axioms A1 and A2 can be stated in two forms; a weak form in which all inequalities, both in the premise and the conclusion, are weak or a strong form in which all inequalities are strict. It is known that the weak and strong forms of A1 are equivalent, but this is not so for A2. Hence, some authors refer to the strong version of A2 as strict stochastic transitivity (Fishburn, 1973).

RemarkFollowing Cavagnaro and Davis-Stober (2014) and Tversky and Russo (1969) we will assume the strict form of A2.

The conditions in A1 are the minimum required in order to guarantee transitivity of preferences. Although there are applications for which weak stochastic transitivity (WST) is appropriate there are many others for which it is not. In particular WST allows for Condorcet type paradoxes (Heckel, Shah, Ramachandran, & Wainwright, 2016). For example, consider the following choice probabilities p12=p13=0.6 and p23=1. It is easy to verify that these probabilities satisfy WST and are consistent with the ranking 1≻2≻3. Note, however, that the average choice probability of the second, and not the first, ranked item is the highest. This phenomena arises because the global ranking does not agree with the ranking derived from comparing items to a fixed standard.
Clearly, A2 implies A1 so strong stochastic transitivity (SST) imposes more stringent constraints on the choice probabilities. Note also that A2 guarantees that if pij>pji then pik>pjk for every k. Thus, the order induced by all pairwise comparisons and the order induced by comparison to a fixed item will not conflict. This eliminates Condorcet type paradoxes and provides sufficient structure for varied statistical analyses [7], [26], [40], [47]. There are though, scenarios where SST might not be strong enough. Consider for example a knockout tournament where the seeding of players is random. One would expect that if i≻j then player i is more likely than player j to win the tournament. However, as demonstrated in Israel (1981), this does not generally hold under A2. Moreover, assumptions A1 and A2 are associated with NP-Hard estimation and inference procedures [7], [16], [47].
It may not be immediately clear that A3, proposed by Latta (1979), imposes a form of transitivity. Notice though that strict-monotonicity of H implies that H(pij,pjk)≥max{pij,pjk} when pij≥pji and pjk≥pkj (see Property 2.6 of Latta, 1979). Thus A3 implies A2. The relation A3, was studied under the axiom of richness, i.e., for every item i∈J and every p∈(0,1) there exists an item j∈J such that pij=p. It was shown that A3 together with richness imply that for all i and j
(1)pij=F(μi−μj)where F is a strictly increasing continuous function which satisfies F(x)+F(−x)=1 and F−1(p) exists and is unique for all p∈(0,1). This class of functions coincides with the class of distribution functions of symmetric continuous random variables. Therefore, from now on, we refer to functions satisfying F(x)+F(−x)=1 as symmetric. As noted by a referee, stochastic transitivity by composition proposed by Latta (1979) is closely related to the concatenation principle from measurement theory, the monotonicity axiom in Suppes, Krantz, Luce, and Tversky (1989) and weak bicancellation in Falmagne (2002). Also, as pointed out by a referee, the work of Latta (1979) is closely related to Theorem 1 in Chapter 17 of Suppes et al. (1989).
A function F which satisfies (1) will be referred to as a comparison function. In the machine learning literature the comparison function is sometimes called the link function, whereas in the economics literature it is referred to as the contest success function [30], [48]. Each item i∈J is associated with some μi∈R called a score, merit or strength. Let F3 denote the class of strictly increasing symmetric comparison functions. Choice probabilities that satisfy (1) with F∈F3 are said to satisfy linear stochastic transitivity or simply LST. The class of functions F3 is related to the class of functions identified by Latta (1979) in the following way:

PropositionConsider a set of labeled choice probabilities PJ that satisfy (1) for some comparison function F∈F3 and some merit function μ where the image of μ over J is R. Then, choice probabilities satisfy the richness condition if and only if function F is continuous and F−1(p) is uniquely defined for every p∈(0,1).

We emphasize that the scores are in fact a realization of a mapping μ:J→R which satisfies (1) for every pair (i,j)∈J. When F∈F3 the mapping μ can be viewed as a real-valued utility function [14], [15]. There is a large collection of models that satisfy (1). These include the Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) models [1], [24], [46], [56], Thurstone models (Thurstone, 1927), and others [4], [55]. One advantage of this class of models is that estimation of choice probabilities typically reduces to a convex optimization problem (Tsukida & Gupta, 2011) whereas estimation under A1 and A2 yield NP-Hard problems [7], [16], [47] as mentioned earlier. We also note that, under BTL, stronger players will always have better chances of winning knockout tournaments (Chung & Hwang, 1978), which, as noted earlier, cannot be guaranteed under A2 alone.
Axioms A1 to A3 describe local relations among triplets of choice probabilities. As such they may be viewed as primitives. As noted earlier, Axiom A3 is equivalent to the linear model (1) which completely describes the global structure of the choice probabilities. That is, given a vector of scores μ and a comparison function F the choice probabilities and the relationships among them are completely determined. Model (1), in contrast with A3, provides a convenient and structured framework in which paired comparison experiments can be studied. Thus, it is desirable to re-express A1 and A2 using a model whose building blocks are a set of merits and some generalized comparison function. Other theoretical challenges in the field involve clarifying the connections between Axioms A1 to A3.
Our contribution.The main contribution of this paper is to derive more convenient functional equivalents of the axiomatic primitives A1 to A3. Doing so, provides global models in the spirit of (1) for Axioms A1 and A2, thus extending considerably (Latta, 1979). Later on, we disassemble Axiom A3 into components that resemble A2 and A1. In particular, new and elegant constructions of ordinal utility functions are provided. These are similar to the construction in Debreu (1958) without making use of the quadruple condition. In fact, under the conditions of Debreu (1958), if the quadruple condition is substituted for A2, then there will exist an infinite subset of items which satisfies A3. Somewhat surprisingly, an equivalent statement does not hold under A1. We also provide identifiability and uniqueness results for the new classes of functions, considerably extending [42], [55]. Throughout, we demonstrate the convenience of the functional representations. We do so by deriving equivalence relations between models that were previously inaccessible in the standard axiomatic forms. Proofs and additional results are provided in the Appendix.
