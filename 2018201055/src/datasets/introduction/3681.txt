Holographic display can reconstruct wavefront of a 3D scene and provide all the depth cues that human eyes can perceive [1]. Hence the research on holographic three-dimensional display technology remains a focus all the time. With the development of computer technology, we can model both existing and virtual 3D scenes in order to obtain their mathematical descriptions [[2], [3]], and the 3D scenes can therefore be calculated and reconstructed through computer-generated hologram (CGH).
Stereoscopic hologram algorithm [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8]], which can record and reconstruct vivid 3D scenes of both virtual and real objects without requiring a highly stable coherent optical system, is one important kind of methods for calculating the CGHs. In the methods, the hologram is segmented spatially into multiple holographic elements (hogels) and two-dimensional (2D) parallax views of 3D object are generated by computer and captured by microfilms [9]. Meanwhile, the use of computer graphics rendering techniques helps add multiple shading effects and make the 3D scene more realistic [10].
Based on the theories, Yatagai [8] proposed that the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of each 2D parallax view would be calculated to generate the corresponding hogel and that all hogels would be tiled as a whole hologram according to the viewpoint order. But it causes the lack of depth information of the 3D scene since each hogel only corresponds to a 2D parallax view during reconstruction. In order to provide accurate depth information, Zhang Hao [10] proposed a method based on fully computed holographic stereogram calculation, which integrated both point source algorithm and holographic stereogram based algorithm. In this method, the object points are fetched according to the spatial spectral information of each hogel and smooth motion parallax with occlusion effect is produced through multi-viewpoint rendering process. However, the point source algorithm brings high computational load and reduces computation efficiency. To enhance the computational speed, the layered algorithms based on the angular tiling concept were presented [[11], [12]]. The 3D scenes are sliced into groups of layers according to the viewing directions. Afterwards, the layered holographic stereogram based on inverse Fresnel diffraction [13] in which the inverse Fresnel diffraction based on FFTs is performed in the calculation was proposed. The algorithm proved the reconstructed quality and reduce computational amount efficiently. It is worth mentioning that the computational complexity is proportional to the number of sliced layers, so the huge computation exists probably. With the evolution of fast generating CGHs, the wavefront recording plane (WRP) technique [14] was thought as an efficient approach to accelerate the calculation. Hence, the scheme of taking advantages of the WRP in stereoscopic hologram calculation was proposed [15] recently. It was proved to reduce the calculation time to a certain extent. However, the employ of point source based algorithm in the calculation process of each WRP still occupies considerable computation loads.
A method based on nonuniform sampled wavefront recording plane [16] was presented as a more simple and efficient way to calculate CGH from 3D object in which the generation of CGH only involves two nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) [[17], [18]] and two fast Fourier transform (FFT) operations. In this paper, we propose a new thought by combining the nonuniform sampled WRP algorithm with the stereoscopic hologram algorithm. In order to calculate the stereoscopic CGH, the shading images and depth images from multiple viewpoints are obtained by the perspective projection first. Then each corresponding hogel is generated by using the nonuniform sampled wavefront recording plane. Thus the method achieves the goal of efficiently decreasing the amount of calculation as well as providing full depth cues with acceptable reconstruction quality.
