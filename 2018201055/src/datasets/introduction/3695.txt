Identification of unknown individuals is a challenge in the South African context. In cases where there is a strong suspicion regarding the identity of the unknown individual and a close relative is available, methods such as DNA comparison and dental record comparison are useful. However, because of socio-economic and other reasons in the South African context, unidentified individuals without known relationships are commonplace [1]. In these cases, it is not possible to identify unknown individuals with primary identifiers and therefore forensic facial reconstruction/approximation is often used to obtain information on a case [1], [2].
The facial reconstruction/approximation process always begins with the placement of the eyes. Facial recognition (especially of familiar individuals) is dependent on the morphology of the orbital area [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], therefore it is important to be precise and correct in placing the eyes [8] and associated features. The eyes are to be positioned supero-laterally in the orbit according to guidelines established by expert studies [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Although conflicting findings on the position of the eyes have been reported [16], several studies [8], [14], [15] provide strong evidence of a more superior and lateral placement of the eyeball in the orbit. Specific distances of this position have been established for some populations [8], [14], but it is uncertain how applicable these absolute values are in the South African context.
Variations in the position of the endocanthion and exocanthion are also reported in the literature. Although all researchers did not use directly comparable landmarks to define the position of the endocanthion and the exocanthion, the general trend indicates that the endocanthion is positioned lower than the exocanthion [8], [16]. A study by Stewart [17], however, found the endocanthion and exocanthion to be on the same level. It would therefore be of value to determine the position of these landmarks in South African groups.
Similarly, variations have been reported in the dimensions of the eyeball. Although the eyeball is often considered as almost spherical [15], slight elongation in certain axes has been reported in the literature [15], [18]. The medio-lateral axis was found to often be longer than the supero-inferior axis [18].
In South Africa, guidelines created for and based on other populations are often applied in facial approximations (Capt. T.M. Briers, personal communication, 2014). However, these guidelines may not necessarily be applicable in the South African context as a degree of inter-population variation exists in facial features. It is postulated that these inter-population differences may have an effect on facial approximations and its accuracy, as is often demonstrated in practice. The less accurate a facial representation, the smaller the likelihood of an unknown individual being recognised and identified.
The purpose of this study was to assess specific features related to the eye in South Africans and compare it to established guidelines commonly used in the facial approximation process. The features assessed included the position of the eyeball within the orbit, the size of the eyeball and the position of the canthi.
