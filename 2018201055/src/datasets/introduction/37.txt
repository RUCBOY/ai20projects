The use of anode materials with layered structures leads to the creation of large adsorption surfaces. That help to achieve a significant charge capacity of the electrode [1]. Also, in such electrodes, the diffusion path becomes shorter and faster. This is important for obtaining a higher battery charge rate. Silicene is a 2D silicon structure with a buckled monoatomic layer. This is a silicon analog of graphene. Both in graphene and in silicene, electrons behave like massless fermions in the vicinity of the Dirac points [2]. The non-flat (i.e. bending) structure of silicene makes it more suitable than graphene for many applications [3]. Silicene has unique features such as the quantum spin Hall effect, large spin-orbit interaction and tunable band gap [4].
Due to sp2-hybridization and dangling edge bonds, self-standing silicene has low stability and, probably, cannot exist without a substrate [5]. The stability of silicene increases with increasing number of layers [6]. The bilayer silicene on the graphite substrate formed from graphene sheets is a stable structure. It is resistant to lithiation/delithiation processes, even in the presence of the large number of vacancies [7]. A certain affinity between the structures of silicene and graphene plays an important role here.
The silicene surface can be easily functionalized [8]. The necessary mechanical and electronic properties of the silicene structure can be tuned by doping. Various techniques could be used for doping of silicon: rapid-thermal diffusion from spin-on doping sources [9], accelerated diffusion of phosphorus in a single crystal of silicon, which takes place during the decomposition of the over-saturated inhomogeneous solid solution [10], low‐temperature molecular beam epitaxy [11], high-temperature ion implantation [12]. Unfortunately, neither technique produces a highly homogeneous dopant concentration. In addition, the ion implantation can result in the unwanted lattice defects in the semiconductor. The method of neutron transmutation doping has also become widespread [13]. The significant advantage of this approach is the possibility to control the amount of dopant and its uniform distribution over the initial material [14]. As a result of transmutation, phosphorus is formed from silicon, and nitrogen is formed from carbon.
The electronic properties of free-standing silicene doped with phosphorus, as well as the change in its shape, were considered in an ab initio study [8]. The silicene structure remains unbroken even at high temperatures because the bond between Si and P atoms is very strong. There is a significant change in the electronic structure of the hydrogenated silicene when the phosphorus doping varies from 1.4% up to 12.5% [15]. Moreover, the higher the phosphorus concentration, the greater is the difference between the energies of the Fermi level and the maximum of the valence band (0.13–0.79 eV).
The future of silicene is associated with its possible integration into the efficient energy, mostly, development of a new generation of energy storage and autonomous devices such as lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). Silicon-based electrodes can have a specific capacity of up to 4200 mAh/g [16]. However, the use of bulk silicon in Li-ion batteries leads to its degradation during lithiation/delithiation cycles [17]. On the contrary, the use of a two-dimensional analog of silicon, silicene, can be promising for improving LIBs. Silicene has a large specific surface area, high mechanical flexibility, and electron mobility. So, it can be considered as a suitable material for LIB. The DFT calculations demonstrated that the theoretical specific capacity of a single-layer silicene anode is estimated as 954 mAh/g [18]. For a two-layer silicene anode, it has a value of 1384 mAh/g [17]. It is 2.5–3.7 times higher than that of graphite electrodes. Moreover, the structure of the silicene sheet does not degrade during lithiation and delithiation [19]. Not only lithium, but also sodium batteries can have a greater performance. For example, solid-state sodium batteries with Na3PO4 electrolyte are characterized by the increased safety and low-cost production [20].
Silicene is noticeably inferior in strength to graphene [21]. The tensile strength of silicene (23 GPa) is 5–6 times lower than that of graphene. When silicene with vacancy defects is used in the anode design (instead of perfect silicene), the high capacity values of the two-dimensional electrode are achieved [22,23]. The Si–P bond (∼3.1 eV) is stronger than the Si–Si (∼2.3 eV) and P–P ones (∼2.09 eV). So, it can be expected that doping of silicene with phosphorus can strengthen the defective silicene [24]. It is of interest to find out, how promising is to use the phosphorus-doped two-layer silicene as the anode material of the new generation LIBs.
The present study is aimed at the investigation of the mechanism of the lithium ion motion along the flat open channel. The channel is formed by the phosphorus-doped silicene sheets and located on the nitrogen-doped graphite substrate. In addition, the study of the structure and mechanical properties of the channel walls as the lithium ion moves along the channel is also the goal of the present work.
