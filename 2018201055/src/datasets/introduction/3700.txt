The aim of a brain-computer interface (BCI) is to provide a communication channel for patients who have lost normal communication abilities due to severe motor impairments (Wolpaw, McFarland, Neat, & Forneris, 1991). A BCI system can transform brain activities into control commands Daly et al. (2011), Jin et al. (2017), Wolpaw (2012) and has gained interest in neuroscience and rehabilitation engineering Dornhege (2007), Jin et al. (2015), Wolpaw (2012). Among BCI systems, the motor imagery (MI)-based BCI stands out for its advanced approach without the need for body movement and with only minimal requirements for auxiliary equipment (Yuan & He, 2014). MI-based BCI systems utilize the brain activity associated with imagined motor movements as control commands for external devices He et al. (2015), Onose et al. (2012). These systems operate without external stimulus and thus are more easily used than stimuli-based BCIs Pan et al. (2013), Wolpaw (2012). Upon imagining movement, the rhythmic activities of the brain observed in the mu and beta rhythms are suppressed contralaterally. These phenomena are termed event-related desynchronization (ERD) and event-related synchronization (ERS), respectively (Pfurtscheller & Da Sliva, 1999).
EEG data is characterized by its high-dimensionality, low signal to noise ratio, and susceptibility to outliers Jin et al. (2011), Pfurtscheller and Da Sliva (1999), Thiyam et al. (2017). The dimensionality can be reduced by extracting those subspaces where features have highest discriminative power Pfurtscheller and Da Sliva (1999), Thiyam et al. (2017). Common spatial pattern (CSP) (Fukunaga, 2013) is a method for extracting features to reduce the dimensionality, and is one of the most efficient algorithms applied to MI-based BCIs (Ramoser, Müller-Gerking, & Pfurtscheller, 2000). The CSP algorithm was first used to detect abnormalities in the EEG data (Koles, 1991) and introduced into BCI applications in 2000 (Ramoser et al., 2000). Currently, the majority of state-of-the-art MI-BCIs use a fixed time window of EEG data to extract the MI features. However, the time latency during an MI period varies between trials for each participant, and it cannot be known with certainly when participants start to perform the MI task Ang et al. (2012), Rodriguez-Bermudez et al. (2013). Some studies have extracted original EEG data 4–7 s and 0–3.5 s after the trial begins (Qiu et al., 2016) or 2.5–4.5 s after the cue appears (He, Wei, Wang, & Zou, 2012). Some other studies did not extract the original EEG data after the cue appeared Reinhold et al. (2015), Solis-Escalante et al. (2010). This approach commonly leads to low classification accuracy because of interference from invalid data.
In this study, we propose a novel correlation-based time window selection (CTWS) algorithm for MI-based BCIs. First, all the training MI samples of each class were averaged as a reference signal and updated based on correlation analysis and performance evaluation until the optimized reference signals for each class were found. Second, the optimized reference signals were employed to adjust the starting points of MI time windows for both training and testing samples, based on correlation analysis. Third, the feature extraction and classification algorithms were used for target detection, and the cross-validation method was performed to evaluate the average classification accuracy.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes applied datasets and proposed methods; Section 3 shows the result of classification accuracy and distribution of features extracted; Section 4 presents the discussion; and Section 5 concludes the study.
