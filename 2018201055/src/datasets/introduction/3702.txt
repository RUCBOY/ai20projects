Inference to the best explanation (IBE) or abduction is an ampliative mode of reasoning which is often defended as central to scientific reasoning, but also seems to capture aspects of evidential reasoning as it occurs more generally, including in everyday life. IBE proceeds by considering a number of plausible candidate hypotheses in a given evidential context and then comparing these hypotheses in order to make an inference to the one that best explains the relevant evidence. It has been discussed widely in both the philosophy of science and computer science literature [1], [2], [3], [4].
There has been a lot of interest in the relationship between IBE and probability, particularly in debates about the compatibility or otherwise between IBE and Bayesian inference [5], [6], [7], [8] and on IBE or abduction in the context of Bayesian networks [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Here the focus is on using probabilistic approaches to determine which one of a collection of competing hypotheses provides the best explanation of the evidence. These approaches enable two key questions about IBE to be addressed. First, they provide ways of making IBE precise by specifying what is meant by ‘best’. Various probabilistic measures have been proposed to this end in the literature [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Second, they make it possible to investigate whether selecting the best explanation is a good strategy for inferring truth. In this context, some studies have been carried out using computer simulations to evaluate how well various measures perform in hypothesis selection tasks and provide more general defences of versions of IBE based on probabilistic measures [18], [20], [21]. Hence, although the paper does not attempt to address all the philosophical issues surrounding IBE (see for example [2], [3]), the results obtained are very relevant to those debates.
An interesting aspect of previous work is that in cases where there is uncertainty in the prior probability distribution over the hypotheses, inference based on a coherence measure for ranking hypotheses outperformed the approach that simply selects the most probable hypothesis in light of the evidence [18]. The current paper builds on this work by providing a more adequate and realistic account of how probability can be used in IBE and a more systematic evaluation of how IBE so construed performs as a mode of reasoning when ignorance of a catch-all hypothesis, uncertainty regarding the prior distribution, initial elimination of implausible hypotheses, and variations in the number of pieces of evidence available are taken into account.
These are important considerations for IBE in general. For example, whether in the context of scientific reasoning or in everyday, commonsense reasoning, it would be unrealistic to assume complete knowledge of all possible hypotheses. As such, inclusion of a catch-all hypothesis allows for IBE to be modelled and evaluated in a more realistic way. Similarly, even among the known hypotheses, it would be unreasonable to expect that they should all be evaluated in detail since the number of hypotheses could be large and some hypotheses might be considered very implausible based on background knowledge. Hence, modelling this practical aspect of IBE enables us to see how it affects its performance.
Rather than exploring IBE in the context of particular applications, whether in science or everyday life, the goal of the paper is to evaluate IBE as a general mode of inference. More specifically, the goal is to investigate the performance of various probabilistic models of IBE. Thus, the focus is of a conceptual nature, but by incorporating more realistic aspects of IBE into the simulations the results may also have implications for how IBE could be justified and used in practical applications.
