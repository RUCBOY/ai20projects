Fluid simulation is a popular research topic in computer graphics, virtual reality while has a huge application demand in three-dimensional visualization and human-computer interactions etc. In recent years, mesh-free methods had a rapid development and have become a competitive alternative to mesh-based methods for fluid simulation in computer graphics. Among various mesh-free approaches, Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is the most popular method for simulating fluid due to computational simplicity and efficiency. For SPH methodâ€™s particle nature, it is suitable to simulate free surfaces and complex phenomena such as spindrift, explosion. At present, SPH has been successfully used for fluid simulation [1], [2], [3], [4], fluid-solid coupling [5], [6], [7], [8], multiphase fluid [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], etc.
Although SPH has been used to produce animation of various fluid phenomena, simulating small-scale fluid surface details by particle-based method is rarely discussed. From the perspective of simulation domain size, fluid animation includes large-scale and small-scale. Large-scale simulation usually has significant computational costs, therefore it always ignores the detail effects of local region, for instance the simulation of ocean scene. For this type of simulation, acceleration algorithm and efficiency improvement are necessary. While small-scale simulation prevailingly pursues realistic effect of local details, such as simulating water droplet which needs more microcosmic details. Using SPH method to simulate small-scale surface details realistically, however, is still a challenging problem. Because the computed density of particles at the fluid-air interface is lower than its real value, which is caused by lacking neighbor particles. It results in negative pressure and causes particle clustering. In addition, the simulation of microscopic characteristics reguires a large amount of calculation, and has time step restriction and numerical instability problems. To solve the above problems, we propose a surface small-scale surface details simulation method using Divergence-free SPH (DFSPH) that can obtain a good microcosmic detail effects of free surface and improve the computational efficiency and stability.
