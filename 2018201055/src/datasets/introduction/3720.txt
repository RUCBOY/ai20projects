In the last few years, reversible computing has received much attention and has become one of the emerging important technologies. In 1960, Landauer [1] proved that using irreversible logic in computation would dissipate KTLn2 joules of heat energy for each bit of information lost. (K is referred to Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature at which computation is performed). Nowadays, energy dissipation is an important issue in modern technologies such as low-power VLSI designs [2,3]. Reversible logic is focused on as a special class of quantum computing that implements unitary functions [4]. Any unitary operation is reversible; hence, reversible logic must be used to design quantum circuits. In 1973, Bennet [5] proved that if a computation were performed in a reversible logic, energy would not be dissipated. Bennet showed that if a technology were based on reversible logic, the energy consumption could be as low as possible in theory. If an algorithm could run backward, then it could be called a reversible algorithm [6]. Reversible circuits (gates) have the same number of inputs and outputs, and the input vector states are uniquely reconstructed from the output vector states [7,8]. The constraints in designing reversible circuits are fan-out free and feedback free. Therefore, the reversible circuit design is more difficult than the design of the irreversible digital circuit [9]. Recently, because of the increasing number of inputs and outputs in integrated circuits and also reducing the physical size of integrated circuit implementation, the digital circuit design has become more complicated. Multi-valued logic is used instead of binary logic as the solution for this issue [10,11]. In multi-valued logic, the logic of the three values (Ternary) are emphasized [12]. Designing quantum circuits with reversible ternary gates, compared with reversible binary gates, can reduce quantum cells; thus, the result will have better performance and higher speed [13].
The binary logic system only uses 0 and 1 digits, whereas, in ternary system 0, 1 and 2 digits are used. The qutrit is referred to the quantum ternary digit in the ternary quantum computer. A qutrit quantum computer design is presented in Refs. [[14], [15], [16]]. If using a ternary system in comparison with a binary system, in the same N-dimensional space, 37% of qutrit is less used than qubit. So logical functions designed in ternary logic will be 37% more compact [17]. Different designs for ternary reversible circuits have been proposed in the literature. Reversible ternary adder suggested in Refs. [11,[17], [18], [19], [20]] and comparator circuits are presented in Refs. [[21], [22], [23]]. The performance of ternary circuits for quantum/reversible computing refers to the number of M-S (Muthukrishnan and Stroud) and shift gates. M-S gate is a primitive gate in quantum/reversible ternary computing, which is implemented in liquid ion trap quantum technology [14]. M-S gates are the implementation of controlled-Not among qutrits in Ternary logic. The reversible ternary circuit design can be performed by a sequence of 1-qutrit shift gates and 2-qutrit M-S gates.
Consistent with its financial and commercial applications, the decimal computing is important. Another reason for considering the decimal computing is that all decimal numbers cannot be accurately expressed by binary numbers. Therefore, it cannot be stated that the decimal arithmetic result will always be the same as binary arithmetic result equivalent. Typically, the decimal computation is performed on binary hardware using emulation software that is accompanied by the mathematical approximations. Therefore, the use of binary circuits for decimal computation makes the calculation process slow. Accordingly, higher efficiency will be obtained if the hardware designed for decimal arithmetic is used. With the increased demand for decimal arithmetic, reversible decimal adder/subtractor has also been introduced in various research works by using BCD codes [24,25]. Ternary coded decimal (TCD) codes similar to binary coded decimal (BCD) codes are used for coding decimal digits to ternary digits.
In this paper, for the first time, we have proposed a novel design for reversible ternary decimal adder/subtractor circuit which uses Ternary coded decimal (TCD) codes. Recently, the design of TCD Adder is suggested by Haghparast et al. [17]. In this paper, new circuits for the TCD Adder and TCD Adder/Subtractor are presented. Our proposed TCD Adder is more efficient than the proposed circuit in Ref. [17]. In the design of the TCD Adder/Subtractor, three new blocks of reversible 3-qutrit ternary adder have been used, so that, the unused inputs and outputs are eliminated for the application of each block in TCD Adder/Subtractor. In addition, the circuit proposed for the invalid TCD detector is more efficient than the equivalent circuit in Ref. [17] and has a fewer gate number. All proposed circuits are realized with ternary 1-qutrit shift and 2-qutrit M-S gates.
The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 presents the basic concept of reversible ternary logic and basic reversible ternary gates that will be used in the following sections to design the proposed reversible ternary circuits. Ternary coded decimal (TCD) codes are introduced in section 3, and in this section, the decimal addition and subtraction using TCD codes are explained. Section 4 presents the realization of proposed reversible ternary circuits. First, we propose three blocks of the reversible 3-qutrit ternary adder; and then, the circuit of TCD detector and TCD Adder are proposed. Finally, we propose new circuit for reversible TCD Adder/Subtractor. In Section 5, the evaluations of the obtained circuits are discussed. The conclusion of our work is presented in Section 6.
