The behavior of cells, their influence on their own environments, and the feedback of the environment onto the cells themselves have been of extreme interest and importance in biology and biophysics. In addition, there is strong evidence that suggests that the mechanical properties such as texture and stiffness can affect cell function and development [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. Cellular migration, a vital part of many biological processes [[12], [13]] such as embryonic morphogenesis [[14], [15], [16]], is yet another example of a mechanically affected aspect of cell behavior. Another beautiful example of the importance of mechanical forces in cell division is provided by Burton and Taylor who measured traction forces and showed how they localize during cell division in an elegant experiment [17].
Many experimental techniques have been used to study the cellular response to mechanical stimuli [[18], [19], [20]]. One needs to understand how the mechanism of mechanical stimulus is transformed into biochemical responses and vice versa [18] which requires the measurement of the distribution of forces at the molecular level. This is not possible to do with current experimental techniques. Furthermore, simulations allow testing many different conditions at a much lower cost. Finally, it is difficult to separate mechanical stimuli from biochemical stimuli in the lab. Computational methods eliminate the biochemical noise that exists in these types of systems. There has been a considerable effort to develop computational models [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25]] that can focus on the mechanical behavior of cells without addressing any of the complex biochemical processes that occur during cell division and growth. This is also the case with the current model: it focuses purely on mechanical behavior. We would also like to note that there are mathematical and computational models that focus on the biochemical aspects (and ignore mechanical aspects). Such models include phase field-based approaches such as the one by Howard et al. [26] and coupled partial differential equations, e.g., the recent one by Shtylla [27].
In general, mechanical models can be at the continuum level, where interaction functions are used to approximate bulk properties, or discrete cell based (or agent based) two and three-dimensional models. Continuum models use local interaction functions to simulate tissue, rather than collections of cells. In these kinds of models, cell behavior is abstracted into functional forms containing expressions for density, growth rate, death rate, and inter-cellular interaction strength [[28], [29]]. Continuum models have been used to successfully study tissue growth and topological rearrangements [[28], [29], [30], [31]]. Unfortunately, due to their macroscopic nature, information regarding inter-cellular interactions is lost.
Numerous agent based methods, based on particle and lattice models, have also been proposed to address the mechanical aspects of cell division at a more detailed level. Examples include Delaunay Object Dynamics (DOD) [[32], [33], [34], [35]], Vertex models [[36], [37], [38], [39], [40]], and lattice based models such as the cellular Potts Model [[41], [42], [43], [44], [45]], which itself can be extended to phase-field models [[24], [46]].
It is surprising that despite the fundamental importance of cell division, and the influence of mechanics on it, there are very few software packages available to study it. This is drastically different from fields such as materials and biomaterials research. To the best of our knowledge, there are no freely or commercially available packages comparable to the one presented in this paper. Current free software packages are mostly based on the cellular Potts model, such as CompuCell3D [47] and CompuCell [48]. There is also the two dimensional Cellular Potts Model Library called Tissue Simulation Toolkit based on the work of Graner and Glazier [42] (available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/tst/), and cellGPU by Sussman [49]. Other methods are also available, for example LBICell that uses elastic polygons and the immersed boundary method [50], and the agent-based package CellSys by Hoehme and Drasdo [51] that is available as a free binary executable for non-commercial use. Commercial software includes the so-called Cell Division Program based on the work of Pyshnov [52]. Interested readers are referred to several recent reviews of computational models [[53], [54], [55]].
In this work, we present a software package named CellSim3D for simulating the mechanical aspects of cell division computationally. Our fully three dimensional approach is based on the 2D models originally described in [[22], [56]]. The mechanical properties of cells can be related to the model parameters as discussed in Section 2. In our previous work using the 2D cell division model [22], the details of the parameter mapping between the model and real experimental systems were shown and verified. In particular, we showed that the model can accurately and spontaneously reproduce cell packing topologies similar to that in the Drosophila [57] wing disc, thus providing a proof of correctness of the general approach. Importantly, the user can easily change these parameters if a different mapping is required. In addition to the simulation code, the software package includes a number of analysis tools as described in Section 3.1.5.
CellSim3D is able to simulate the organic growth of tissue from a single cell (starting from more than one cell is supported as well) into tissue with up to approximately 106 cells in 3D. Since the focus is on the mechanical aspects of cell behavior, the CellSim3D force-field, detailed below, assumes that all biochemical parameters are kept the same for all cells. Other terms that account for biochemical differences can be added later.
In brief, the CellSim3D code enables the simulation of the following, purely mechanical aspects of cell behavior and cell division:


1.The manner in which, and the strength with which, cells interact with each other and their environment mechanically. The physical origin of this is their membranes with inter-membrane interactions.2.The mechanical effects of a cell’s growth and division on its neighbors.3.The mechanical response of a cell to external stimuli (the external stimulus itself need not be mechanical).4.Cell migration: the mechanical basis within the cell, and the mechanism used to move on a substrate or in an external matrix.5.The interplay between all of the above, including between cells of different types with different mechanical parameters.
