Over the last half-century, component mode synthesis (CMS) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] has frequently been employed in structural dynamics as an efficient and powerful tool to analyze the dynamic response of large finite element (FE) models with small computational effort. The primary concept of CMS is substructuring, and because of this, CMS is often called a dynamic substructuring method [19], [20], [21]. The first CMS method was proposed by Hurty in 1965 [1], and shortly thereafter, the Craig-Bampton (CB) method [2] was developed, and is the most popular CMS method at present. Later, various CMS methods were developed based on the CB method, and have been applied in many engineering fields [22], [23], [24], [25].
In the CB method [2], using substructural eigenvalue problems, the substructural normal modes are computed, and those are classified into dominant and residual substructural modes using mode selection methods [22], [26], [27], [28]. Then, the constraint modes are computed to define the static deformation between the substructures and the interface boundary [2]. Finally, a reduced model is constructed by synthesizing the dominant substructural modes, a very small portion of the total substructural modes, and the constraint modes.
In general, the error between the global (original) and reduced models is caused by the residual substructural modes that are neglected. Based on this fact, the residual substructural modes can be regarded as a crucial ingredient for improving the solution accuracy of the reduced model. Recently, using the residual flexibility matrix to compensate for the residual substructural modes, the enhanced Craig-Bampton (ECB) method [29], [30] was developed. The ECB method results in a greatly improved reduced model in aspect of the solution accuracy.
However, the ECB method has limitations for solving large FE models involving more than hundreds of thousands of degrees of freedom (DOFs). In the ECB method, the substructuring is accomplished by using the physical domain-based substructuring considering the geometrical characteristics of the structure. Therefore, it is not easy to make a large number of substructures. In such cases, each substructure may contain relatively large DOFs and thus the computation time for calculating the constraint modes, which requires the computation of the inverse of a matrix, would be considerably expensive. In addition, because the residual flexibility matrix, a key to the ECB method, is highly populated, thus it has substantial memory requirements and requires restricting computational work during the reduction procedure. For these reasons, the original ECB method is not appropriate for dealing with large FE models. Given the recent trend of increase in the size of FE models, these limitations should be resolved.
In this study, to resolve the aforementioned limitations, we improve the performance of the ECB method. We first identify sources deteriorating the computational efficiency in the original method, and focus on managing them effectively in the proposed method. To increase the computational efficiency and reduce the requirement for computer memory, we use algebraic substructuring [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], giving many small substructures, instead of physical domain-based substructuring. To reduce the size of the interface boundary, inevitably increased by algebraic substructuring, interface boundary reduction [39] is employed. In the improved ECB method, the residual flexibility matrix, reflecting the residual substructural modes, is applied only to the reduced mass matrix. This is a significant feature for reducing the computation time. We also demonstrate a computer-aided formulation for efficient implementation and computer memory management of the proposed method.
In Section 2 of this paper, the original ECB method is reviewed in brief. In Section 3, the improved ECB method is derived, and the computer-aided formulation is presented in Section 4. In Section 5, we verify the performance of the proposed method through several large structural FE models, and finally, conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
