Since internet of things is aimed to connect everything (e.g., sensors, information appliances, or devices) to the Internet to provide a more accurate and convenient service to people, the possibilities of IoT have been discovered and discussed for years [[3], [18], [48], [78], [6], [69], [8], [49]]. According to the report [22], the market of internet of things and machine to machine technologies was forecasted to be up to USD 883.55 billion in 2022. From the study [1] that depicted the concept of IoT up to now, the applications of smart home [[10], [44]], smart city [43], smart grid [17], or even business intelligence all further explain that the number and diversity of IoT applications will gradually increase at different succession stages today. Of course, we all know that the possibilities of internet of things are not limited to these applications; on the contrary, it will be part of our daily life, and it will provide more better applications that simply cannot be realized before. For example, forecasting the traffic collision and forecasting the traffic jam are two difficult tasks for intelligent transport systems, both of them, however, can be mitigated once all the cars are connected to the Internet and the statuses of them or around them are reported via the technologies of IoT and vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), called the internet of vehicles (IoV) [77].
From the perspective of history, the Internet has undergone several transformations from the so-called “Internet of Data” to the “Internet of Content” and then to the “Internet of People” [55]. But today, the term “Internet of Data” (IoD) in some recent studies [12] can be regarded as the extension of internet of things, which contains much more information than just data collection by objects,1 such as virtual tags for the collected data from RFID tags. No matter what the definition of IoD is, there is no doubt that the data contains a lot of information and knowledge, especially data from IoT, which apparently may support us to develop a better service. That is why how to find out useful information from these data has become an important research issue [64]. But the amount of data of internet of things is typically very large; thus, they cannot be stored in a single machine. Such data also are collected from different kinds of devices and are created very quickly. The data deluge caused by IoT can be regarded as a kind of big data. That is why several recent studies [[25], [20], [75], [37]] took into account IoT, big data, and cloud computing together. In these researches, internet of things is considered as a large integrated system for which cloud computing is used to provide the computing power and storage space it needs and big data is used to provide a new way to find out useful information from such a large scale of data.
Since a possible solution is to use a cloud computing platform to support data mining algorithms to find out hidden information from the data of IoT, how to use free machine learning libraries or how to develop parallelized mining algorithms for a cloud computing platform has become a critical research topic. For the free machine learning libraries, Mahout [38] for Hadoop or MLlib [[58], [41]] for Spark are two representative solutions. It does not matter either free machine learning libraries (e.g., Mahout or MLlib) are used or parallelized mining algorithms with the MapReduce model are developed, both of them have pros and cons. Although free machine learning libraries can be used to achieve data mining task, its development has some restrictions. Even though we can decide how to develop parallelized mining algorithms, it typically has a high barrier, especially redesigning the data mining or machine learning algorithms for the MapReduce model.
Different from using free machine learning libraries to develop data mining tools on a cloud computing environment, another research trend is to develop parallelized mining algorithms to be run on a cloud platform. The same data mining algorithms can be applied to a cloud platform in many different ways [[47], [80], [15], [35]]. It is confusing for researchers new to this research domain which way is better. A general and high level description will be useful to reduce such heavy burdens. A simple data clustering framework for cloud computing platforms is presented in this study via the MapReduce model. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:


1.This paper provides a brief review for the data mining algorithms (i.e., clustering, classification, and association rule) from the Hadoop to the Spark platform.2.This study presents a unified framework to ease the application of population-based metaheuristic-based data clustering algorithms to a cloud computing platform (i.e., Spark) for analyzing the data from the edge layer of an internet of things system.3.In addition to the descriptions on the design details of the proposed framework, we implement several clustering algorithms using this framework for the Spark environment to show its possibilities.
