Finding community structure in networks becomes very important. Community structure of the network gives more information about the network and the relationships between its nodes. To understand the structure of a network we find and analyze its community structure. For instance, in social networks a community structure represents groups of people who have common features and/or interests. Finding the community structure can help scientists to discover nodes with the same(or common) properties and insure similar roles in the network and visualize the structure of the network.
Networks can represent many systems shush as metabolism [[1], [2]], Internet and the world wide web [[3], [4], [5]], epidemiology [[6], [7]], scientific citation and collaboration [[8], [9]] etc. A network has two sets, the first one is a set of vertex (or node) and the second is a set of edge. The vertexes represent the individual’s members of the system and the edges represent the links between nodes in a defined relationship of the system. For example, in a social network, a person is represented by a node, and the social interaction of relationship between two people is represented by an edge. In the following paper we consider a network as a graph G(V,E), such as V is the set of nodes (|V|=n) and E is the set of edges (|E|=m).
The division of network nodes into groups (clusters) is called community structure. Where the network connections at each group (community – cluster) are dense. Many community structure detection methods have been developed. Some methods can find the community structure for unipartite and unweighted networks, others for weighted networks. And some methods find only disjoint communities (the set of intersection between communities is empty) others can find overlapping communities [10]. Furthermore, some methods are hierarchical (merging or splitting methods), others are based on maximization of an objective function etc. Therefore, these methods can be classified according to different criteria [11].
In this paper, we propose a new method for unweighted and undirected networks to find their community structure. Our method is based on the splitting of the network based on the genetic algorithm and the optimization of the function of quality called modularity [12]. For a graph G(V,E) our method can find the most optimal community structure π={c1,…,ck}, such as ⋃i=1k=V and ci≠∅, ci∩cj=∅ (for i,j=1:k). The paper is organized as follow. The concept of genetic algorithm is presented in Section 2. Our approach is detailed in Section 3. Experimental results are shown in Section 4. Finally, we conclude in Section 5.
