Image is the main way for humans to understand the world. Since many images in the real world contain circular targets, the detection of those circular targets is a basic problem in computer vision and pattern recognition. And it can be extensively used in industrial product inspection, video detection, particle tracing, cell analysis, robot technology, iris detection, motion capture, etc. [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. As the basic tool for detecting circular targets, Hough transform operates with the basic idea of converting the original image into parameter space, and describing the circles in the image with the circle parameters satisfying most edge points. The required circle parameter information is obtained by finding the points corresponding to the peak values through accumulation in the accumulator [6,7]. Hough transform has two main advantages: (1) Insensitive to image noise; (2) Convenient for parallel computing. However, there are three main disadvantages of the standard Hough transform: (1) Heavy computation load; (2) Huge memory; (3) The fact that the extracted parameters are constrained by the quantized interval of the parameter space.
So far, a lot of new circle detection methods have been proposed, which mainly focus on three aspects: the detection speed, robustness and accuracy. Moreover, those methods can be roughly divided into three directions: (1) Research on circle detection methods based on random sampling [8,9]; (2) Research on circle detection methods based on circle property [[10], [11], [12]]; (3) Research on circle detection methods based on related intelligent algorithms [[13], [14], [15]]. Among them, the circle detection methods based on random sampling boast strong robustness and high accuracy. And the typical examples are randomized Hough transform (RHT) and randomized circle detection algorithm (RCD). RHT is put forward by Xu et al. [8,16] as a major improvement to the Hough transform. It mainly uses the random sampling in the image space and the many-to-one mapping mechanism from the image space to parameter space. Its process involves three stages: (1) Randomly sample from the edge image 3 different points, which are used to calculate a circle parameter; (2) Determine if it is possible to find a candidate circle by searching the parameter link-list; (3) Judge whether the candidate circle is a true circle. In contrast, RCD, proposed by Chen and Chung [9], does not require an accumulator for preserving the relevant parameter information, thereby avoiding huge memory space and computation time consumed in the parameter accumulation process. The method is a random selection of 4 points from the set of edge points, in which any 3 points with mutual distance greater than a certain threshold can determine a circle parameter. If the fourth point is also on the circle, evidence-collecting should be conducted to determine if the circle is a true circle.
Slow computation speed is the main drawback of RHT and RCD. To address the problem, extensive further research has been done on RHT [[17], [18], [19], [20]]. For instance, Ji and Xie [17] improved the robustness and accuracy of circle detection by analyzing error propagation, and accelerated the detection by selecting the points that are most likely on the circle and that produce the most accurate circle estimation. Jiang et al. [20] developed a novel method to find candidate circles. The method quickly determines whether a circle corresponding to a circle parameter is a candidate circle by selecting several points from a particular area. Also, there are many further studies on RCD [[21], [22], [23], [24]]. For example, Chung et al. [22] adopted the strategy of multiple-evidence-based sampling to improve the computation speed of RCD, and enhanced the detection accuracy with an improved method. De Marco et al. [23] achieved desirable detection speed and accuracy based on the local information related to isophotes curvature and a kernel density estimation.
The main reason for the slow detection speed of circle detection methods based on random sampling is as follows: there is a very low probability that the points randomly selected from the edge image are on the same circle. Aiming at improving the effective sampling rate, this paper presents a fast circle detection algorithm based on difference area. Under certain conditions, the proposed method makes random sampling from the difference area. The circle detection speed is greatly improved because the proposed random sampling strategy is much more effective than random sampling from the edge image. The strategy of random sampling from the difference area can be directly applied to RHT, RCD and their improved versions, thus improving the detection speed of these algorithms.
