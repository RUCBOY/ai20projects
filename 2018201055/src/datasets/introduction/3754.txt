Throughout this paper we consider simple undirected and connected graphs only. Let G be such a graph on n vertices, the energy of G [[1], [2], [3]], denoted by E(G), is defined as the sum of the absolute values of all eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. If a graph G on n vertices has the same energy as the complete graph Kn, i.e., E(G)=E(Kn)=2n−2, then G is said to be borderenergetic, see [4]. For more details on borderenergetic, we refer to [[5], [6], [7], [8]].
Let A be adjacency matrix and D diagonal matrix of vertex degrees of G, respectively, then L=D−A and Q=D+A are called the Laplacian matrix and the signless Laplacian matrix of G, respectively. The Laplacian energy of a graph G [9] is defined as LE(G)=∑i=1n|λi−d¯|, where λ1≥λ2≥⋯≥λn−1≥λn=0 are the Laplacian eigenvalues of G and d¯ is the average degree of G. For its basic properties, see [[10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. More recently, Fernando Tura [16] proposed the concept of L-borderenergetic graphs, which means LE(G)=LE(Kn)=2n−2, and gave several classes of L-borderenergetic graphs. For more results on L-borderenergetic graphs, see [[17], [18], [19]]. In this paper, we extend this concept to signless Laplacian energy of a graph.
For signless Laplacian spectral properties see [20]. The signless Laplacian energy of a graph G is defined as QE(G)=∑i=1n|qi−d¯|, where q1≥q2≥⋯≥qn≥0 are the signless Laplacian eigenvalues of G and d¯ is the average degree of G. We refer to a graph G as Q-borderenergetic if its signless Laplacian energy equals that of the complete graph Kn, i.e., QE(G)=QE(Kn)=2n−2. We construct an infinite family of graphs satisfying QE(G)=LE(G)=2n−2, see Theorem 3. It is interesting that this family of graphs also gives a positive answer to the open problem mentioned by Nair Abreu et al. in Ref. [21], that is whether there are connected non-bipartite, non-regular graphs satisfying QE(G)=LE(G). We also construct another two infinite families of Q-borderenergetic graphs. Then, we obtain some bounds on the order and size of Q-borderenergetic graphs. Finally, we use a computer search to find out all Q-borderenergetic graphs on no more than 10 vertices, the number of such graphs is 39.
