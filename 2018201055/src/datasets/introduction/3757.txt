Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a robust MRI modality [1], that delivers directional information about the water movement in a given voxel. It reveals noninvasively microscopic details for tissue, that is beyond the reach of any other imaging techniques. The example of a new tissue contrast, derived by DTI, is distinguishing tissues on the basis of diffusion anisotropy differences [2] expressed by a scalar factor called Fractional Anisotropy (FA) [3]. It allows characterization of the changes associated with aging and many neurodegenerative diseases [4]. Moreover, in tissues with a well-organized microstructure, such as nerves, muscles, ligaments or tendons, water diffusivity is greatest along the direction of fibers [5], therefore, knowing the direction of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue it is possible to infer the course of the fiber tracts in the tractography process [6], [7], [8]. Tractography has many clinical applications [9], [4] and is believed to be one of the most notable advances in the field of neuroimaging in recent decades.
There are two main classes of tractography algorithms: deterministic and probabilistic. The first ones follow the direction of the eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue. The latter ones repeat the deterministic procedure many times introducing some random perturbation of the fiber direction during each repetition. Deterministic algorithms produce a chain of points that can be connected into a fiber. On the other hand, probabilistic ones generate a connectivity index along a given white matter pathway, that corresponds to fiber organization.
There are several robust methods that utilize higher diffusion models [10], [11], [12], probabilistic algorithms [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] or both of the above approaches [18], [19], [20], [21]. Nonetheless, deterministic tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging data is still most common in clinical practice. Therefore, apart from developing novel methods, it is also reasonable to improve the quality of the DTI-based approaches.
The relation between the diffusion tensor D and the signal intensity S is given by [22]:(1)S=S0e-b:D,where S0 reference signal and b is so-called b-matrix, which incorporates the parameters of the diffusion sensitizing gradients. According to Eq. (1), the reliability of diffusion tensor imaging is limited by the fidelity of determining the b-matrix. Its exact form is influenced by number of factors, like Bo field inhomogeneity [23], [24], concomitant field [25] and other, such as eddy currents, which are related with the applied imaging protocol [26], [28]. Due to the above factors, the b-matrix is spatially variable [27], [29], what is neglected in standard DTI sequences (standard DTI or S-DTI).
Although some techniques have been proposed to reduce each of the above-mentioned effects, it would be very difficult and time consuming to control all of the above factors in the same time. There are also some known methods of correction the spatial inhomogeneities of diffusion gradients [30], [31], [32]. Nevertheless, they are based on the characteristics of a gradient coil system, which can be provided by the manufacturer or obtained by the magnetic field mapping. These methods do not take into account the sequence-related factors, such as eddy currents, what limits their potential. Moreover, the exact gradient performance is a commercially sensitive and information and can differ even between scanners of the same model. There are also other proposed techniques [33], [34] of correction the diffusion gradient inhomogeneities, but they are able to correct only the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and neglect the anisotropic information, what would not improve the fiber tracking. To some extent, the errors could be mitigated by applying more than 6 gradient directions, however, it would require a much longer scan time.
Alternatively, the gradient field can be effectively mapped using the b-matrix Spatial Distribution in DTI (BSD-DTI). It is a calibration method using a diffusion anisotropic phantom with a well-defined structure [35]. It allows to indicate the exact form of the b-matrix for each voxel separately without the necessity of knowing the sources of a given distribution. Its advantage is that the same imaging sequence is used for calibration than for imaging, so every sequence-dependent factors are accounted. The effectiveness of this technique has been theoretically evaluated in its complete and simplified versions [36], [37] and demonstrated for isotropic and anisotropic diffusion phantoms [27], [38]. The BSD-DTI technique allows to correct not only the magnitude, but also the direction of the diffusion gradient, what is crucial for accurate fiber tracking.
Two kinds of errors can occur as the effect of the diffusion gradient inhomogeneity. Distortion of the diffusion tensorâ€™s eigenvalues and rotation of the eigenvectors. In other words, the diffusion ellipsoid can be misshaped or rotated. The fiber tracking reliability is affected mostly by the rotational errors, which are much more difficult to assess. Therefore, in this study, the influence of diffusion gradient inhomogeneity on the DTI-based tractography is analyzed using computer simulations. In particular, we consider the deviation of the measured fiber orientation from its real position depending on the number of diffusion gradient directions, their distortion and the position of the examined capillary phantom inside the scanner. The potential ability of the BSD-DTI technique to correct these kinds of errors is presented. The most important findings of the simulations have been confirmed by means of MRI experiment.
