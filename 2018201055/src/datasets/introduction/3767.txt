Traditional models of learning, which involved the use of tests to assess the acquisition of knowledge regarding large blocks of information, have evolved toward methods in which both learning and its assessment are progressive. These models are part of a new paradigm of student-centered learning that was heavily emphasized in the trend report produced for the 2010 Bologna Anniversary Conference [1]. This report stressed the importance of designing activities that allow students to acquire knowledge via participation (active learning) rather than solely learning information through teacher-driven activities [2,3].
This novel and reoriented education model has been accompanied by the development of different collaborative learning methods involving the resolution of real and simulated cases. These learning methods might be applied via project work, problem-solving, case studies, or concepts or mental maps [[4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]; additionally, these methods can make use of information systems and even certain key features of traditional learning approaches [[14], [15], [16]]. In this context, the development of information technologies has led to the creation of new educational methods and learning activities such as e-learning, online learning, Internet-based learning or web-based learning, all of which marry well with student-centered learning [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21]].
The use of intelligent systems in general, as well as, intelligent information access (IIA) systems in particular (e.g., recommendation systems, search engines, keyword annotators, learning algorithms, etc.), is an emerging strategy that is being applied by certain virtual learning environments (VLE) and as a component of learning activities [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. A good example of the extent to which intelligent systems are being incorporated into VLEs is the emergence of new scientific disciplines that study the application of text and data mining techniques within the field of education, such as educational data mining (EDM) and learning analytics and knowledge (LAK) [[26], [27], [28]].
The application of IIA systems in the biomedical domains is becoming a reality. In this context, the ability to automatically search for concepts in natural language medical texts has been under continuous development for approximately 20 years. MedLEE [29] was one of the first systems designed to extract clinical information from unstructured text, linking it to terms belonging to a controlled vocabulary entitled SNOMED CT [30]. Appearing in 1994, it was used to process radiological reports [31]. Another major system, MetaMap [32], which was developed by the National Library of Medicine (NLM), is focused on the identification of concepts that best represent text introduced by a user [33]. An excellent review of these information systems and their applications is available in the article authored by Meystre et al. [34].
Given the practical nature of the health professions, active learning methods have been rapidly adopted in medical education. This fact has been accompanied by increased development of intelligent systems that utilize these methods, e.g., tools that incorporate semantic information via annotation [35,36], and annotation and recovery systems based on the use of ontologies [[37], [38], [39]].
The ability of these types of systems to enable the integration of knowledge sources and, thus, allow end-users to recover descriptive information on the elements extracted or to delve further into these data using concepts related to the elements that are recognized is without precedence. In addition, although some IIA systems have been successfully tested in educational settings, there is a lack of knowledge of: (i) teachers’ perceptions of these systems and their use in learning activities; and (ii) teachers’ knowledge regarding the text mining techniques applied to process user input.
Taking into consideration the aforementioned findings, in our current work, we designed and carried out individual semi-structured interviews with BS and HS faculty members to gather expert opinions regarding the benefits of using different methods and IIA systems to process natural language texts and the utility of these methods as tools in the application of learning activities. Specifically, questions were designed to collect information around the following main blocks: (1) general information and knowledge of active teaching methods; (2) knowledge related to concept annotation; (3) knowledge related to cross-lingual concept extraction; (4) knowledge related to concept/mental maps; and (5) classification of the examined IIA systems.
