Sensory analyses are carried out to measure the sensory quality of meat and meat products, being the quantitative-descriptive analyses the most widely used (Andrés et al., 2004, Ruiz et al., 1998). Data obtained by means of sensory analysis are as reliable as those from physical–chemical determinations (García and Carrapiso, 2001). These techniques measure the characteristics that influence consumers’ acceptance, such as appearance, texture, odour, taste and flavour. Sensory analyses are tedious, time consuming and require the destruction of the pieces and a trained panel. In addition, in the case of meat products, they are carried out at the end of their processing, when there is no possibility of modifications to improve some sensory traits. In the last years, the evaluation of the meat and meat products by using non-destructive methods have given a great growth (Antequera et al., 2007, Collell et al., 2011, Fantazzini et al., 2009, Manzoco et al., 2013, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2014).
In this sense Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and computer vision techniques have been proposed as an alternative or complementary technique to traditional methods, since they are non-destructive, non-invasive, non-intrusive, non-radiant ionization and innocuous. In fact, several works have been carried out to determine quality attributes of hams (Antequera et al., 2007, Bajd et al., 2016, Caballero et al., 2016a, Caballero et al., 2016b, Fantazzini et al., 2009, Manzoco et al., 2013, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2010, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2011, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2014) and loins (Antequera et al., 2003, Caballero et al., 2017a, Cernadas et al., 2001, Cernadas et al., 2005, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2015, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2017a) by using MRI. High field MRI scanners are frequently used in these researches, which implies high quality images but they are so expensive. In this sense, low field scanners that are cheaper could also be used for food analysis. The problem of this type of scanners is its low signal to noise ratio, being necessary the selection of an adequate sequence acquisition (Perez-Palacios et al., 2017a).
Most of these studies have used computational texture feature algorithms for analysing MRI. These algorithms integrate matrices based on second-order statistics in order to produce different computational texture features (Antequera et al., 2003, Cernadas et al., 2005). Pérez-Palacios et al., 2010, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2011 have found a relationship between computational texture features and some physico-chemical components and sensory attributes of Iberian hams.
In recent years, there is a growing interest in the use of fractal image analysis techniques instead of classical texture analysis methods. This is mainly because the image texture seeks to compress image information while the use of fractals allows the identification of recurring patterns, removing the possibility of image compression. The fractal concept studies the degree of symmetry or self-similarity found in a structure at all scales (Hibbert, 1991, Mandelbrot, 1982, Tominaga and Fujiwara, 1997, Sun et al., 2014). The most widely used algorithm is the classical fractal algorithm (CFA) (Mandelbrot, 1982), which is an implementation of Minkowski-Bouligand algorithm. CFA has been applied to characterize the microstructure of fruits and vegetables (Cardenas-Pérez et al., 2016, Quevedo et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2014), fish (Manera et al., 2016, Perisho et al., 2016), meat (Quevedo et al., 2013, Zapotoczny et al., 2016). However, only two studies about prediction of quality parameters of food have been found. Tsuta et al. (2002) applied them to predict the sugar content of melons and Polder et al. (2004) measured the chlorophyll of tomato by applying of fractals. Other fractal algorithms have been recently developed, fractal texture algorithm (FTA) (Caballero et al., 2017b) and one point of fractal curve texture algorithm (OPFTA) (Caballero et al., 2017c). Up to now, Caballero et al. (2017b) have applied FTA to analyse MRI from meat products in order to determine some quality characteristics non-destructively, whereas the use OPFTA in food have not been studied yet.
Data obtained from MRI analysis have been normally processed by applying usual statistical tools, such as Pearson's correlation coefficients or principal components analysis (Perez-Palacios et al., 2010). The integration of heterogeneous information with computer vision data and the analysis of this new data set by data management and database applications would be innovative and could give accurate results, playing an increasing role in furthering food research (Cortez et al., 2009, Holmes et al., 2012).
Currently, there is a growing interest in these techniques, mainly due to the decreasing cost of large storage devices and the development of robust and efficient algorithms to process these data sets (Mitchell, 1999). They are focused on extracting information from large data sets, grouped in what is known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). Data mining is one of the data analysis stage in the KDD process, as a non-trivial process of finding knowledge and potentially useful information from data stored in repositories (Fayyad et al., 1996). It extracts hidden information by automatic or semi-automatic analysis, finding interesting unknown patterns (Sayad, 2011). There are some examples of data mining applied in quality traits of different meats (Cortez et al., 2006, Dissing et al., 2013, Song et al., 2002), and determining some quality parameters of Iberian meat products (Caballero et al., 2016a, Caballero et al., 2016b, Caballero et al., 2017a, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2014, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2017a).
Combining image acquisition, image analysis and data analysis, the main objective of this study was to evaluate the capability of different fractal algorithms to analyse MRI of loins in order to predict sensory attributes of this product. In addition, the prediction accuracy of combinations of different sequence acquisitions of MRI, fractal algorithms to analyse MRI and predictive techniques of data mining were analysed.
