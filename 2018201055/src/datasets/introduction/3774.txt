As an excellent probe for topmost atomic layer, slow positron (es+) beams have been widely used in surface physics and material science to perform the nondestructive detection of defect. Within the last decade, several strong es+ beams have been established with the intensity of 107–109 es+/s, which remarkably promote the high counting rate applications such as scanning positron microscope and positron annihilation induced Auger-electron spectroscopy (PAES) [1]. All these beams are based on large scale facilities especially reactors, including NEPOMUC at FRM-II[2] (20 MW, 1-3×109es+/s), PULSTAR at NCSU [3] (1 MW, 0.5-1×109es+/s), POSH at Delft (2 MW, 8×107es+/s), and KUR source (5 MW, 1.4×106es+/s) [4]. Researchers in Netherlands were also trying to design a source at the HRF in Petten [5], [6].
Intense es+ beams is also highly demanded in China, however, no such facility is available now in China. Fortunately, the research reactor CMRR (China Mianyang Research Reactor) is now putting into use with the power of 20 MW and operation days of 150–200 per year. It is a good opportunity to build an intense beam of the order of 109es+/s. It is full of challenges to design such facilities, which involve four main physical processes. Many researchers have made significant contributions to describe it or part of it. Seeger stated the models of positrons slowing-down in condensed matter [7]. Moxom discussed the positron extraction from moderator accounting for the re-emission [8], and presented beam formation in electrical/magnetic field [9]. Hugenschmidt established the physical model of a γ -beam based source. And Djourelov detailed presented the converter design of ELI-NP based source [10].
Apparently, we also need a good understanding of es+ source and suitable simulation tools for design task before construction. In Section 2, we demonstrate our efforts on establishing analysis models and their validation. By using these tools, key factor of design has been found, and a proper design of positron source for CMRR has been proposed as presented in Section 3.
