Many wide bandgap semiconductor materials have been studied for their potential utility as radiation detectors for operation in harsh terrestrial environments and for future space missions. Compared with narrower bandgap semiconductors, e.g. Si (Eg = 1.12 eV at room temperature [1]), the wide bandgap semiconductor silicon carbide (4H-SiC, Eg = 3.27 eV at room temperature [2]) has a higher breakdown field, lower intrinsic carrier concentration, and better carrier saturation velocity [1], [3], which can bring benefits for high temperature operation. Moreover, SiC detectors have high radiation tolerance [4], [5], which can be an important feature for both terrestrial and space applications. Therefore, SiC is expected to play a major role in future spacecraft electronics, particularly as a material for semiconductor radiation detectors used in spectrometers.
SiC was first reported as a particle detector in 1999; detectors made from a 310μm thick semi-insulating 4H-SiC substrate and with different sizes of circular Ohmic contacts (1 mm to 3 mm diameter) were illuminated with a 90Sr β− particle source [6]. Since then, SiC has been studied intensively for particle detection. SiC particle detectors can have high charge collection efficiencies [7], [8], good linear energy response, and excellent energy resolution [9], [10]. SiC particle detectors have also shown stability for extended periods and suitability for operation over a wide range of temperatures (27 °C to 227 °C) [11]. Outside of particle detection, significant work developing SiC for photon counting X-ray spectroscopy has been conducted and reported with superb results [12], [13]. Recently, SiC p-n photodiodes intended for UV detection have become widely commercially available. With well-developed fabrication technology and high-quality material, low-cost Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) SiC detectors open the possibility of using SiC detectors for applications such as industrial monitoring (e.g. monitoring and controlling the thickness of materials, and monitoring of spent nuclear fuel assemblies) as well as low-cost space science (e.g. as electron spectrometers to measure the energy and particle density of electrons in low earth orbit and elsewhere). Much valuable work has also been reported considering SiC detectors for use in laser-plasma diagnostics and the related fields [14], [15], [16], [17].
Whilst larger space missions (those comparable to ESA Cosmic Vision S-, M-, and L- Class missions) are likely to continue use custom-detectors for the foreseeable future, mass-produced COTS SiC detectors, like those reported here, may be of value to groups developing CubeSat space science missions at universities and other organisations. Previously, results demonstrating the use of commercial 4H-SiC p-n photodiodes for X-ray spectrometers have been reported [18], [19], [20]. In this paper, we present work investigating such photodiodes for their suitability as detectors in electron spectrometer at temperatures up to 100 °C.
