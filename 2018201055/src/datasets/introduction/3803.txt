In recent years, research is focused towards improving the automated friendly pedestrian environment. The intelligent transport system (ITS) methodologies are being used to answer pedestrian safety problem in streets. The problems like a pedestrian crossing the road and pedestrians having impairments tribulations have been the focus of ITS researchers [1]. In modern days, people are adopting security monitoring through cameras. Surveillance cameras are being seen everywhere from roads to buildings. Automated monitoring of big video data through camera surveillance is becoming a big demand to reduce human burden. Also, automated monitoring can be utilized to analyze pedestrians’ behavior. Automated gender recognition has been a demanding field to research over past many years. In real, human beings differentiate people as male or female based on gait, voice, clothes, jewelry, hair styles, body shapes, face looks [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]] and skin color. Tremendous approaches have been presented in this area based on facial features [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. The face-based gender recognition requires a proper visible face for prediction. While for the pedestrians’ case, the images are usually acquired from the cameras that are at a far distance from the pedestrians. The distant images sometimes cause poor visibility of pedestrian’s face. This is because the pedestrians objects are at a distant location from the camera and sometimes the resolution of face region becomes lesser than 16 × 16 [14]. Such type of images lie under very low resolution (VLR) image problems. The studies show that at least 32 × 32 resolution is required for face recognition [15]. In addition, the face-based recognitions also fail when the camera is located on the backside of person. The whole body and the pedestrian appearance can be a cue for predicting pedestrian’s gender. The loose-fitting clothes can also create a problem in understanding exact body shape. The strong cues for such scenario can be body appearance that covers attributes like long/short coats, skirts, long/short hair, pants, shorts and shoes.
The automated recognition system that identifies humans as either male or female can be useful in a variety of applications. Some are: (a) Counting total number of men and women in a crowd [16] (b) Automated behavior analysis of males and females in a shopping mall (c) Human and robots communication where intelligent robots require gender information to perform appropriate communication with humans [[17], [18]] and (d) Intelligent Transportation System to ensure pedestrians safety [1]. In this paper, the intention is to recognize pedestrians as male or female. Main contributions of this article include the following.


i.The gender is recognized based on body appearance.ii.Pedestrian parsing procedure is followed which creates a silhouette of the input pedestrian image. That silhouette image is used as a binary mask to remove background from the input image.iii.The stacked sparse auto encoder (SSAE) is used for pedestrians’ gender prediction.iv.The performance of gender is evaluated on different pedestrian orientations such as front, back and mixed views.v.Improved and acceptable outcomes are achieved in terms of accuracy.
