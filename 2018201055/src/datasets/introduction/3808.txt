Image retrieval is a computer technique for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images. Originally, to search for images, some keywords of images are used for retrieving the target images. However, manual image annotation is time-consuming and expensive, even mistaken. Aiming at these questions, more and more researchers paid more attention to do some research on content-based image retrieval (CBIR) [1]. At the outset, CBIR aims at avoiding label description and similarities based content (color, shape, texture etc.) are applied. With the development of CBIR, the semantic concept [2] is incorporated and some classic features combined with SVM [3] are used for semantic-based retrieval. Except for the classic SVM models, decision tree [4], Bayesian model [5] and some other models are also used for retrieval. At the same time, image classification [6], semantic-based image composition [7] and semantic-based image completion [8] are also supported by these models.
In recent years, as one classic model in the machine learning, deep learning model [9] has the overwhelming advantages compared to traditional models. CNN-based methods [10], [11], [12], RBM-based methods [13], [14], [15], Autoencoder-based methods [16], [17], [18] and Sparse coding-based Methods [19], [20], [21] are classic models in the field of computer vision. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) could be used through training multiple layers and there are usually convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) was proposed by Hinton in 1986 and it could be considered as a generative stochastic neural network usually concluding visible units and hidden units. The antoencoder-based model also could be considered as one special type of artificial neural network which could be used for learning efficient encodings. The sparse coding-based model describes the image through learning adequate basic functions. The four classic methods of deep learning have brought revolutionary promotion to the computer vision field and more improved models based on them are also applied.
However, high-quality retrieval results of traditional models largely depend on the sufficient learning instances. If the number of learning instances is reduced, the accuracy of retrieval will decline obviously. Especially for the deep learning model, it’s difficult to learn one complete model using insufficient learning instances, not to mention obtaining the high-quality results. In most cases, collecting a large number of learning instances could increase the computing resource and human resource obviously. For some special categories, even if we try our best to collect learning instances, the number of learning instances still couldn’t fulfill the requirement.
As discussed above, how to reduce the learning instances with preserving the accuracy of retrieval has become one meaningful problem. So in this paper, aiming at this problem, we proposed one joint entropy based learning model which could contribute to optimize the distribution of learning instances. In the process of optimization, some double, useless even mistaken instances would be deleted. A small amount of high-quality learning instances could keep high-level retrieval accuracy. The rest of paper is organized in the following: Section 2 introduces the related work of our method. Section 3 introduces our model in details. Section 4 introduces the experiment process and results. Section 5 gives conclusion remarks.
