Shape analysis is a subject of intense research in computer vision. The literature defines the shape of an object as one of its most important visual attributes. Shape is also extensively used in human communication due to the ability of the human visual system in recognizing it by using only its higher curvature points [1], [2]. Moreover, this feature presents a remarkable stability to the changes in illumination and variations in the color and texture of the object [3].
Shape is also fundamental information in many recognition [4], [5], [6] and retrieval [7], [8] systems and plays a key role in many areas and different applications. A more common use of shape analysis is in the recognition of symbols and trademark images. In [6], the authors improve the matching of pixel-level constraint (PLC) histograms [9] by using the power spectra of the corresponding shape contexts. Trademark image retrieval can be improved by combining global and local shape descriptors, as proposed in [8]. For this, the authors use Zernike moments and edge-gradient co-occurrence matrix as global and local descriptors, respectively, thus improving in 5% the precision/recall of the MPEG-7 shape dataset.
Pedestrian detection is another task that benefits from shape analysis. Pedestrians present some inherent attributes such as appearance constancy and shape symmetry, so that shape descriptors focused on these attributes are able to distinguish background from pedestrian regions in an image [10]. In medicine, shape information is used to guide the segmentation of the left ventricular myocardium from cardiac computed tomography (CT) images in a coarse-to-fine strategy [4]. In [11], local shape features and appearance cues are used to perform automatic segmentation of overlapping cervical smear cells.
Due to its importance, many methods for extracting meaningful information from the contour of a shape object have been proposed. These methods usually fall into three categories based on where the shape features are extracted from [3], [12]. These categories are: (i) contour-based, which represents methods that consider the shape as an ordered set of points connected in a curve-like object and use this set to describe the shape [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]; (ii) region-based, which includes methods that use the image of the shape to compute its descriptors [19], [20]; and (iii) skeleton-based methods, which use only media axis information of the shape for its description and recognition (therefore, these methods are suitable for occlusion and articulation problems [21], [22], [23]).
Some recent approaches make use of Radon transform, SIFT and Convolutional Neural Networks for shape analysis. In [24], the authors explore the Radon transform to create a histogram describing the shape. Shape matching is performed by using an angle correlation matrix and the dynamic time warping for a non-linear angle matching, thus achieving a robustness against rotation, scaling, translation and shape distortions. In [25], the authors focus on the task of discovering and segmenting objects from complex backgrounds in video. To accomplish that, they propose a spatio-temporal SIFT flow to discover and segment object regions across frames. Deep learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks have been proposed for different shape analysis tasks. The authors in [26] use deep learning to address the photo cropping problem. In this case, the network is used to select cropping candidates and avoid repeated feature computation in order to achieve higher computation efficiency. In [27], a deep learning model is used to detect salient regions in videos. It captures spatial and temporal saliency information, thus producing a spatio-temporal saliency inference without time-consuming optical flow computation. In [28], a Convolutional Neural Network is used to predict human eye fixation. For this, the authors use a multiscale approach that extracts hierarchical saliency information from the layers of the neural network.
As our contribution to the field of shape analysis, we propose to use a randomized neural network (RNN) to compute descriptors from a shape contour. The basic idea is to use the weights of the neural network as a feature vector for shape description and classification. To explain our proposal, the remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the basic idea of a randomized neural network. In Section 3, we show two approaches to model the contour points as an input and output data for the randomized neural network in order to construct an image signature. An experimental evaluation of the computed descriptors is proposed in Section 4. For this evaluation, we used six shape datasets: (i) Kimia, (ii) Fish, (iii) Leaf shapes, (iv) Rotated Leaf shapes, (v) Scaled Leaf shapes and (vi) Noised Leaf shapes. To improve the evaluation of our approach, we performed a comparison with some traditional shape analysis methods. We present the results and discuss them in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper.
