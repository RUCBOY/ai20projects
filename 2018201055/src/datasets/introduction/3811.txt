Buildings consume a globally significant quantity of energy [1]. European buildings account for 41% of primary energy (27% for residential buildings and 14% for commercial buildings), 22% and 19% in United States respectively [2]. Although buildings consume such a large amount of energy, there is often a discrepancy between a building’s actual energy consumption and that predicted at design time [3]. The many factors which feed into this performance gap might be loosely categorised as design, construction or operational issues [4].
One contributory issue, the role of performance data in building management, has been the subject of much recent study. A number of researchers have considered the role of building performance frameworks that decompose performance assessment into a series of measurable components [5], [6], [7]. A key problem associated with the effective implementation of such performance frameworks is the availablity of performance data and the integration of data from disconnected data silos [8], [9]. For example, building energy management systems (BEMS) typically assess real-time building performance and control building conditions based on advanced communication protocols between various sensing and control nodes [10]. Yet, there is usually little interaction between islands of information such as building information models (BIM) with energy performance predictions for the building and building energy management systems (BEMS) [11]. Recently, the semantic web has been used to enhance data interaction between BEMS and the other information islands [12], [13].
This paper addresses some of the computer science issues surrounding the integration and interpretation of building performance data. There are three main computer science approaches which could be used: 1) the common data model approach, 2) the adapter approach and 3) the linked data approach.
The common data model approach tries to design a central underlying data model as a data hub with agreement between tool vendors. The data hub is then interpreted by domain-specific applications [14]. It is hard to design a highly flexible and scalable data model and to maintain the model after being extended to a huge size. Rather than attempting to convert all data to a particular data model, the adapter approach leverages adapters to integrate cross-domain data silos, representing different architecture, engineering & construction (AEC) domains [15]. However, this approach can lead to significant data loss and it is not feasible to develop adapters for all data silos [16].
The third approach to the interoperability issue is linked data, which uses existing open protocols and the semantic web for sharing unstructured data [17]. The usage of such linked data technologies aims to overcome the differences among software used in diverse disciplines and to connect various domains of information that have opportunities to identify untapped valuable resources within AEC domains [18]. Linked data has been used on data sources including BIM [19] and sensor information [20].
In practice, quantitative performance metrics are key components for building performance assessment. However, to date researchers and industry have yet to take advantage of multi-silo rule-based performance metrics as such metrics are currently isolated from other available contextual data silos [21]. Therefore, this isolation restricts in-depth building performance assessment.
This paper presents a flexible, automated and extensible solution to the isolation issue for the building performance domain. The approach offers a higher flexibility and a finer spectral granularity for performance assessment purposes. Building managers and engineers can simultaneously analyse time-series building performance at a range of levels, without burdensome manual intervention such as is the case with traditional solutions.
The objective of this paper is to show how insightful building performance assessment can be obtained through a novel integration of RDF and OpenMath. RDF provides an open, modular, extensible schema for data sharing in the AEC domain [22]. OpenMath makes the performance formulae be readable for computers, then calculation of formulae can be automated based on computer algebra systems [23].
Based on previous work [24], [25], [26], [27], this research defines an RDF ontology to present performance metrics and link them to available contextual information in linked dataspaces. Two distinct yet interrelated components are designed to evaluate such metrics: the first is a querying algorithm that extracts datum streams for metrics and the second is a computation algorithm that leverages computer algebra systems to calculate metrics.
The paper is structured as follows: the case for building performance assessment with linked data is made in Section 2. Section 3 describes the integration of performance metrics, the RDF schema and OpenMath. Two algorithms are presented in Section 4 to query datum streams for performance formulae and evaluate performance metrics. Section 5 provides a conceptual implementation of this work, while conclusions are provided in Section 6.
