In many contexts (biology, information science, sociology etc.), sets of related entities can be modeled as graphs (networks) G(V,E) [[1], [2]], where the individual entities are represented by a set of nodes V (vertices,|V|=n) and relationships between these entities by a set of links E (edges,|E|=m). For example in biology the metabolic network, nodes are proteins and the links are the chemical interactions between them. In social network, nodes represent individuals and links correspond to the relationships between them. The representation by graph facilitates the study and analysis of the network structure. The graph, which models a context, has parts (groups) which are densely connected internally. This characteristic defined by the existence of subgraphs named communities [2], it is important because it provides more information about the network. The problem of the recognition of these groups where the elements of each group are similar and/or strongly connect between them is called community detection.
Community detection methods are varied according to the network type that modeling the context (unipartite or bipartite, weighted or unweighted, directed or undirected) and the community structure type to search (disjoint, overlapping). However, the community has been defined in more than one way [[3], [4]] in each method. A community in web is group of pages with the same topics; a community in protein–protein interaction network is group of proteins contributing to specific function; a community is group of people share similar interests in the social network. However, most recent approaches considered a community as a subset of nodes densely connected [[5], [6]]. In our study we based on this definition to find communities. The nodes of each community are highly connected, and lowly connected with the rest of the nodes in the network. Our method is proposed for unweighted and undirected networks to find disjoint communities.
We propose a new method called ComDBNS based on the similarity between nodes in the graph to find the community structure. It has two steps: the first step partitions the graph into disjoint groups of nodes (communities) based on the similarity between endpoints of links; the second step merges these groups to find the number of communities indicated at the beginning of the method (k). We have also proposed another version of ComDBNS. The second method we have proposed is ComDBNSQ (Community Detection Based on Node Similarity and Modularity Q) that uses increasing modularity [[6], [7]] as a condition to stop merging groups of nodes in the second step to find the number of communities.
The rest of the paper is organized as follow: Section 2 is about a related work. The concept of nodes similarity and the network modularity metric are briefly introduced in Section 3. The proposed mechanism to detect the community structure is detailed in Section 4. Section 5 analyzes the performance of the proposed method on real complex and computer-generated networks. We conclude our work in Section 6.
