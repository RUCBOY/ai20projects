One of the outstanding mathematicians of the twentieth century, George Birkhoff, argued that the aesthetics of art have mathematical, which is to say a quantitative, measure. The structure in various art forms, music in particular, that he discussed in his book [1] was largely overlooked by other scientists until the last quarter of the twentieth century, when Mandelbrot introduced the scientific community to fractals [2] and his protégé Voss applied these ideas to the mathematical analysis of music. Voss and Clark [3], [4] used stochastic, or 1/f, music, in which notes are selected at random and the frequency with which a particular note is used is determined by a prescribed distribution function, to gain insight into the structure of more conventional music. They determined that a variety of musical forms, jazz, blues, classical, have a blend of regularity and spontaneous change characteristic of 1/f-music. Aesthetically pleasing music was found to have a 1/fα spectrum, with an inverse power-law index in the interval 0.5 < α < 1.5, thereby connecting the structure of music to the physical phenomena of 1/f-noise [5].
In 1987 the newly developed concept of self-organized criticality (SOC) was used by Bak et al. [6] to explain the source of 1/f -noise. Subsequently, 1/f-noise has been found to be an ubiquitous property of complex networks near criticality, such as the brain. This suggests an exciting connection with the problem of cognition [7] because 1/f noise may represent the brain self-organizing through a vertical collation of the body’s spontaneous physiological events. Soma et al. [8] have shown that the brain is more sensitive to 1/f-fluctuations than to other forms of noise, resulting in higher information transfer rates in the visual cortex [9], pain-relief efficiency by electrical stimulation [10] and enhanced efficiency by biological ventilators [11]. West et al. [12] speculate that there is a complexity matching between Mozart’s music (1/f-composition), the brain’s organization (1/f -complex network) and the heartbeat (another 1/f-process), to explain the result of Tsuruoka et al. [13] that listening to Mozart has the effect of inducing 1/f-noise on heart beating. This also supports the conjecture that music mirrors the mind [14] in that its complexity is a reflection of the 1/f-complexity of the brain. The issue of complexity matching is closely related to the subject of the recent workshop [15] and we invite the readers to consult this reference for details on these interesting connections.
The observation that listening to Mozart’s music enhances the reasoning skills of students [16] contributed to the ever-expanding circle of research interest centered on the possible complexity matching between Mozart’s music and brain function. This is a thorny problem having aspects of a number of fundamental human issues, including but not limited to creativity, free will, determinism and randomness [17]. Our purpose here is to present a mathematical theory that explains these interesting aspects of music, which picks up where the above mentioned popular works leave off.
The approach presented herein uses the concept of a crucial event as a fundamental building block for the underlying time series, resulting in 1/f-variability being the signature of complexity. The theory is an application of the recent work of Mahmoodi et al. [18], which contains an intuitive description of crucial events and develops a generalized form of SOC, self-organized temporal criticality (SOTC), based on the dynamics of complex networks. Experimental observation shows that moving from physics to biology is signaled by the emergence of the breakdown of ergodic behavior with increasing complexity. Ergodic behavior is one of the foundational assumptions of statistical physics, that being that time averages of system variables produce results equivalent to those obtained from ensemble averages of those variables [19]. Its almost ubiquitous breakdown in complex systems came as a surprise.
Ergodicity breakdown is caused by complex fluctuations being driven by crucial events. The time intervals between consecutive crucial events are statistically independent and described by a markedly non-exponential waiting-time probability density function (PDF). To realize the temporal complexity of crucial events requires the concept of an intermediate asymptotic region, characterized by an inverse power law (IPL) with index μ < 3. These events are renewal [20] in the sense that their occurrence invokes a total rejuvenation of the system implying that sequential renewal events occur at times having no correlation with the times of occurrence of preceding events. SOTC shows that beyond the intermediate asymptotic region an exponential time region appears which entails that the system recovers the ergodic property in the long-time limit. This exponential truncation, generated by the same cooperative interaction responsible for the IPL nature of the intermediate asymptotic region, is often confused with the effects produced by the finite size of the observed time series.
We conjecture that music, being the mirror of mind, naturally reflects the brain’s dynamics (which is a generator of 1/f -fluctuations [20]) thereby confirming the early observations of Voss and Clarke [3], [4], [5]. However, the arguments adopted by these pioneers are based on the assumption that 1/f-noise is generated by fluctuations with very slow, but stationary correlation functions. Whereas, the crucial events emerging from the statistical analysis of the time series generated by the brain [20], on the contrary, have non-stationary correlation functions. The significance of SOTC modeling is that the crucial events generated are the same as the 1/f-noise produced by the brain, that is, the fluctuations have non-stationary correlation functions.
The importance of crucial events for music composition was recognized in two earlier publications of our group [21], [22]; the first paper illustrates an algorithm for composing music based on crucial events. The present paper is closer to the main goal of the second publication, which was the detection of crucial events in an existing musical composition. Vanni and Grigolini [22] assumed that the time at which a note change occurs is a crucial event and found that the IPL index was μ ≈ 2. Kello et al. [23] define events using the amplitude envelope of the data and study their properties. Out of the many possible ways to define events, we adopt a simple criterion for detecting events based on the volume of the music and we show that these events are crucial events.
Herein we confirm that music is driven by crucial events. Our analysis establishes a significant difference between computer and human performance of the same musical score, which is not surprising. The computer plays the notes as written by the composer, without interpretation. Humans, on the other hand, bring all their knowledge, experience and feeling for the music to their performance. The computer can provide the heart of the music, but only a human can make the heart beat.
We also make a preliminary attempt at establishing a connection between crucial events and multifractality. A time series without a characteristic time scale can be characterized by a scaling exponent, the fractal dimension. An even more complex time series can have a time-dependent fractal dimension, resulting in a spectrum of fractal dimensions. This spectrum defines a multifractal time series and the width of the multifractal spectrum is a measure of the variability of the time series’ scaling behavior.
