Breast cancer is a leading cause of death in women in both developed and developing countries. Currently, there is no method available for prevention of breast cancer. Mammography is the best available tool for detection of breast cancer in the primary stage (DeSantis et al., 2011). A mass recognized by mammography is one of the important symptoms of breast cancer. Radiologists diagnose such masses by reading mammograms, which is not an easy task. Therefore, suspicious tissues are removed from the breast to check for the presence of cancer using breast biopsy. Available facts indicate that more than 60â€“70% biopsies of suspicious masses turn out to be benign cases. The use of a computer based diagnosis system can help to minimize unnecessary biopsies. Such systems can act as a second opinion for the radiologist for effective diagnosis of breast cancer and help to minimize mortality rate. The use of image processing and machine learning algorithms for detection and classification of masses in digital mammograms would be an easier method, but still it is a challenging area of study. This article focuses on the design of an efficient technique for feature selection and classification of masses in digital mammograms. Features submitted to the classifier without feature selection would affect the accuracy of the classifier; this is why feature selection should be applied before classification. The main objective of the feature selection process is to remove irrelevant or redundant features, to improve accuracy of the classifier and reduce computational burden.
