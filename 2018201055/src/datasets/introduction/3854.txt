Universities were first established in the 13th century with the University of Paris, which was the first and most significant university [1]. The main reasons for creating universities are to develop and store knowledge for all of the nation's needs, such as its medical and religious needs. Universities have become the cornerstone of what is now called “higher education” [2]. According to [3], higher education started with four objectives: to provide formal education for the nation; to provide community service; to conduct research, create scholars and build knowledge; and to educate the world. Saudi higher education has 26 universities, which are controlled by the Saudi government [4]. According to [5] [6], the main objectives of Saudi universities are the same as the objectives that are listed by [3]. One of those objectives is research. Publication and citation are important indicators of research productivity at universities [7], [8]. The number of publications is the most common indicator that is used by organizations to evaluate faculties and departments [9]. Currently, in Saudi universities, the number of publications is low, which indicates low research productivity [4], [10].
One of the main objectives of this paper is to enhance research productivity at Saudi universities by using knowledge sharing. Knowledge sharing is one of most important factors for enhancing research productivity at universities [11]. According to [12], knowledge sharing among academic staff leads to high scholarly communication. Another objective is to identify factors that can enhance knowledge sharing for academic staff in Saudi universities. The level of information and communication technology use in the organization can affect the level of knowledge sharing among staff [13]. For example, internet use in an organization leads to positive effects on work sharing among staff [14].
