Atmospheric aerosols are small particles suspended in the atmosphere and have sizes ranging from a few tens of angstroms to several micrometers in diameter.27, 87 Generated by both natural and anthropogenic sources, aerosol particles can have direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative forcing18 and can affect air quality, leading to significant impacts on ecosystems and public health.11 By providing a link between the oceans and the atmosphere, sea-spray aerosol (SSA) represents the largest global fraction of aerosols and plays a major, yet poorly understood, role in determining the state of the atmosphere (e.g., by scattering or absorbing solar radiation, promoting cloud formation, and catalyzing or suppressing chemical reactions).20
It has recently been established that SSA particles can be produced by two general pathways: bubble-cap films bursting at the sea surface and bubble cavity collapse yielding jet drops.104 These two production pathways lead to externally mixed SSA distributions with different chemical compositions that exhibit distinct physicochemical properties (e.g., different hygroscopicities, ice nucleating activities, and optical properties). In particular, it has been found that the concentrations of organic and inorganic species in nascent SSA differ significantly from particle to particle, such that the organic-to-inorganic ratio increases as the particle size decreases. Several organic compounds have been detected in SSA, including lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, and microorganisms.20 Their chemical nature and structural organization play a critical role in altering the properties of SSA particles, modulating surface tension and hygroscopicity, and mediating heterogeneous chemical processes at the interface. Besides the organization of organic material at the interface, structural and dynamical properties of the hydrogen-bond network in the aqueous subphase of SSA particles play a key role in mediating chemical reactivity and promoting ice nucleation. In particular, it has been shown that hydroxylated headgroups of organic monolayers at the interface with aqueous subphases can self-organize in two-dimensional lattices that are nearly commensurate with the basal plane of ice Ih53 and can thus promote ice nucleation above the homogeneous nucleation temperature.83
Different experimental and simulation techniques have been used to characterize the surface properties of organic layers on aqueous subphases.16, 25, 31, 52, 85, 97, 98, 102 Among surface-active compounds, low-molecular-weight fatty acids (e.g., palmitic and stearic acids) have been identified in marine systems and used as proxies for SSA.19, 64 Recently, the effects of pH and salt concentration on the stability and structural organization of palmitic acid (PA) monolayers have been investigated by combining experimental measurements and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.4 In addition, numerous PA monolayers studies have used vibrational sum-frequency generation (vSFG) spectroscopy.2, 34, 39, 95
vSFG spectroscopy is a powerful technique for characterizing aqueous interfaces at the molecular level.9, 13, 22, 36, 37, 45, 84, 89, 90, 108 Initial experimental and theoretical studies were devoted to the characterization of the structure of the air/water interface.23, 41, 44, 49, 61, 70, 71, 73, 79, 80, 92, 94 More recent efforts have focused on gaining molecular-level insights into complex interfaces by determining specific hydrogen-bonding patterns, surface propensity and binding motifs of dissolved species, and effects of interfacial electric fields.15, 33, 38, 65, 66, 72, 91, 99, 107 These studies demonstrated that interfacial water molecules reorient to point their hydrogen atoms toward negatively charged surfaces and away from positively charged surfaces.73 Zwitterionic headgroups of phospholipid monolayers on aqueous subphases reorient water molecules to a lesser extent, but along the same direction as negatively charged headgroups.16 The structure of water in contact with neutral monolayers depends on the chemical nature of the headgroups.6 Two-dimensional heterodyne-detected vSFG spectra showed that the dynamics of interfacial water is particularly sensitive to specific properties of charged lipid monolayers.91
Although vSFG spectra of interfacial water contain information on the underlying hydrogen-bond network, resolving all spectral features into specific structural motifs poses substantial difficulties. In this context, state-of-the-art MD simulations provide the opportunity to directly connect structural and dynamical properties at the molecular level with experimental observables.82, 88 Combining experimental measurements and computer simulations to characterize the structure of water at the interface with zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine monolayers, it was found that the carbonyl groups of the lipid molecules were responsible for reorienting interfacial water molecules to form hydrogen bonds.42 Although most experimental measurements and computer simulations have focused on the influence of lipid headgroups (cationic versus anionic versus zwitterionic headgroups) or the structure of interfacial water, analogous studies on monolayers with neutral headgroups are limited.
In this study, we characterize the structure of water at the interface with a PA monolayer, which serves as a model aqueous interface on nascent SSA particles at pH 5.6, at the molecular level by combining experimental measurements and MD simulations of the corresponding vSFG spectra. Using the experimental interfacial electric potential value, we identify specific features in the vSFG responses that are associated with second- and third-order contributions in both measured and simulated spectra.10, 17, 26, 32, 50, 76, 78 These findings are consistent with the notion that charged interfaces exist between water and both monolayers, which generate static electric fields that penetrate into the bulk region of the liquid where they give rise to an additional polarization responsible for third-order contributions.10, 17, 26, 32, 47, 50, 76, 78, 103, 105 A rigorous decomposition of the vSFG spectra in second-order, surface-sensitive and third-order, bulk-dependent contributions is obtained from MD simulations. The second-order component is then further dissected into contributions associated with distinct hydrogen-bonding motifs, allowing for a systematic analysis of the role played by neutral headgroups with multiple hydrogen-bonding sites, which differ in both nature (i.e., donor and acceptor sites) and interaction strengths, on the properties of interfacial water and the effects of interfacial electric potential. By seamlessly integrating experimental measurements with theoretical modeling, this analysis thus provides fundamental, molecular-level insights into the interfacial properties of nascent SSA particles, which are difficult to obtain by other means. It should be noted that the theoretical and computational approach presented here is effectively complementary to that proposed by Wen etÂ al.,105 who analyzed the experimental vSFG spectra by assuming the validity of the double-layer theory to determine both second- and third-order contributions to the optical response.105
