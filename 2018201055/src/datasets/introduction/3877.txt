Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) implies that managers must be responsible for the consequences of their actions not only in front of stakeholders but also in front of society [1]. This idea has gained importance in recent years and it has become a need for enterprises beyond a competitive advantage [2].
Many factors contribute to this increasing demand. First, governmental organisations are working on mandatory policies, regulations and reporting regarding sustainability, human rights and ecological commitments [3]. Moreover, an increasing social pressure regarding ecological, ethical and sustainable behaviours drives companies to initiate or improve actions in the field of CSR with more or less success [4]. Finally, studies that show how companies improve their results by implementing CSR actions and policies [5] encourage other companies to include actions in its company's strategy.
As a consequence, enterprises all over the world are concerned with the management and disclosure of their actions on CSR considering many standards and regulations that international organisations publish and promote [[6], [7], [8]]. However, enterprises usually apply ad hoc processes integrated with their control management systems [9] or connect CSR results with quality management indicators [10], but they generally do not use specific computer systems to manage CSR.
Information systems and ICT must be continuously aligned with the CSR strategy in order to provide the necessary technological support to accomplish regulations and to manage CSR processes and actions efficiently [[5], [11]]. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is a way to produce software which tries to establish links between conceptual and technological levels, not only with approaches like the OMG's proposal Model Driven Architecture (MDA) [12], but also as Grammarware [13] and others [14]. The application of MDE [15] to implement CSR Computer Systems could provide advantages such as, for example, a more efficient way to develop a computer system, or the capability to incorporate new requirements from the conceptual level where users are more comfortable performing enterprise models [16].
In this field, there are a lot of Enterprise Modelling Languages suitable to model enterprise dimensions like processes, product, organisation or decisions at conceptual level [[17], [18]]. There are also other initiatives such as Unified Enterprise Modelling Language (UEML) which tries to make these languages more interoperable [19]. However, there is no specific modelling language to represent CSR, although some researchers agree that CSR is a key issue which should be modelled in the same way as other enterprise dimensions in order to obtain some of the benefits of MDE [20] as for instance, advantages for interoperability and portability [[21], [22], [23]].
Therefore, it would be useful to define a Domain-Specific Modelling Language (DSML) to develop enterprise models focused on the CSR dimension. This DSML would be suitable for: (1) representing how enterprises currently manage CSR; (2) identifying what CSR improvements are needed in business reengineering projects; and (3) applying MDA to implement computer systems to manage CSR actions and information in an integrated way.
The research work presented in this paper, jointly with the proposal of an Agile Model-Driven Methodology to guide the implementation of CSR Computer Systems, are the two phases included in the project we carried out to define a Model-Driven CSR Framework [20]. The methodology enables the application of Model-Driven Engineering to generate CSR Computer Systems. The definition of the CSR Metamodel, described in this paper, provides a Domain-Specific Modelling Language for CSR (DSML4CSR) that can be used to develop models at conceptual level and apply the aforementioned methodology.
Regarding the method of work used in this stage of the project, we applied a systematic proposal to identify strategic requirements [24] that was conducted out by means of a review of the domain. Therefore, we analysed some recognised international standards on CSR [[6], [7], [8]], newer research works in CSR and current practices on CSR management in actual companies, in order to identify the concepts of this metamodel.
The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes a literature review focused on Model Driven Engineering as a paradigm useful to develop computer systems from business models and metamodelling background. Section 3 shows the method of work used to conduct the research presented in this paper. Section 4 collects the domain analysis performed in order to obtain the requirements for the metamodel. In Section 5, we define a CSR Conceptual Map to understand the requirements, the CSR Metamodel and the CSR UML profile in order to implement the DSML4CSR. Finally, Section 6 outlines the final step of the method of work showing a case study as a proof of concept for the validation of the CSR Metamodel, and Section 7 outlines the main conclusions of the research.
