This article is about General Morphological Analysis (GMA) as a basic, conceptual (non-quantified) modelling method. As such, it can be compared with a wide range of other scientific modelling methods, including System Dynamics Modelling (SDM), Bayesian Networks (BN) and various forms of “influence diagrams”. As will be shown, all of these modelling methods are based on variations among a common set of components and properties, and are developed through the same iterative process involving cycles of analysis and synthesis (Ritchey, 1991, Ritchey, 2012). Indeed, these variations in modelling properties can themselves be modelled morphologically.
Firstly, the theoretical and methodological foundations of GMA as a modelling method are presented. This will include the task of providing a general operational definition of a (scientific) model, in order to identify its components and properties. Next, GMA will be situated within a wider modelling theoretical framework by developing a morphology of modelling methods, which will allow for the systematic identification, classification and comparison of different such methods. The construction of this morphological (meta-) model will also serve as an example of how to “build” morphological models in general. The meta-model also gives us a graphical representation of how a given modelling method can be transformed into another by altering one or more of its parametric values. Finally, a number of GMA modelling techniques will be demonstrated that have been made possible by the introduction of dedicated computer support in the early 1990s.
We begin by discussing the basic nature of a “scientific model”, in order to identify those modelling properties by which to create a morphospace of modelling methods.
