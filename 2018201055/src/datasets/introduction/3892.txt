The use of computer-vision to automatically detect the presence of people, plant, materials and equipment (i.e., objects) from images or videos on construction sites to improve safety and productivity has received widespread attention in the extant literature [1], [2], [3]. Specific applications of computer-vision include: monitoring of progress [1], [4], [5]; tracking of workers [6], [7]; occupational health assessments [8], [9]; quality management [10], [11], [12], and tracking the use of personal protection equipment (PPE) [2], [13], [14].
Several studies have utilized video cameras in conjunction with methods such as the Histograms of Oriented Gradients and Colors (HoG + C) features descriptor, Histogram of Optical Flow (HOF), and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), to detect the presence of objects on construction on-sites [15], [16], [17]. Methods of this nature have been overly reliant upon manually extracting hand-crafted features from inputs that are derived from conventional machine-learning and pattern recognition. Constructing a pattern-recognition or machine-learning system requires careful engineering and considerable domain expertise to design a feature extractor that is able to transform raw images data into a feature vectors that can be used by a classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) to detect or determine patterns in the input [18], [19].
With such methods, the system’s detection performance is highly dependent upon designing an effective algorithm that is able to select and describe the appropriate candidate region. Moreover, the underlying machine learning models are typically trained using small datasets (<10k images/label), which can limit inter and intra-class variability. As a result, this hinders their ability to accurately detect objects on construction sites and generalization to different datasets [20].
To address the limitations of applying hand-engineered features, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can be applied to automatically detect objects on construction sites [21]. While several studies in construction have used CNNs for a variety of purposes such as detecting defects in structures [11], [22], recognizing unsafe behavior [23] and determining the pose of workers on-site [8], there has been limited research that has examined their use to identify workers and heavy plant. By being able to identify workers and heavy equipment unsafe conditions and behavior can be detected and therefore provide managers with a mechanism to improve their safety performance.
CNNs have been found to be highly effective in discovering intricate structures within high-dimensional datasets and therefore can be used for object detection in a number of domains. With this in mind, the research presented in this paper aims is to develop a CNN that can be used to automatically detect the presence of objects in real-time on construction sites. To accommodate the existence of occlusions and the varying size (i.e. scale) of objects that occur on construction sites, an Improved Faster R-CNN (IFast-R-CNN) is introduced and trained to detect workers and plant items. Then, the technical challenges of the developed IFaser R-CNN and the implications for future research are identified. Prior to introducing the CNN, the paper commences with a review of the extant literature of vision-based detection methods in construction.
