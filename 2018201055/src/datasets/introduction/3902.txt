Transport properties of cement paste are of great concern due to their great influence on the safety and durability of cement-based structures [1]. On one hand, thermal and hygric properties of cement paste are deemed to be crucial to the cracking phenomena at early ages [2]. On the other hand, structural performance of cement-based structures during their service time is closely related to the deterioration of material properties, which is greatly attributed by the heat and mass transfer inside the microstructure [2]. Therefore, it is essential to investigate microstructure characteristics of cement paste and develop appropriate simulation and model to reveal the relationship between microstructure characteristics and macroscopic properties.
In general, cement paste is considered as a typical multi-scale porous medium with a large number of pores whose size is perhaps from nano to micro scale. Various experimental techniques have been developed till now for the assessment of pore structure of cement paste [3]. Obviously, each of the existing techniques only corresponds to pores with a certain scale. For instance, nitrogen adsorption test is widely used to characterize small nano pores with size from several to tens of nanometers [4]. While some capillary pores with size possibly from hundreds of nanometers to tens of micrometers need to be detected by back-scattered electron microscopy (BSE) image test [5]. Comparatively speaking, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) test is able to measure a wide scale of pores whose size lies between 3 nm and 100 μm [6]. Despite several limitations of MIP test, it is still considered as an “effective” method for analyzing pore structure characteristics [6]. It is worth pointing out that specimens need to be dried in advance for nitrogen adsorption, electron microscopy and MIP tests. In addition, some specimens may be damaged to some extent and cracks may generate when certain pressure is applied onto specimens during nitrogen adsorption and MIP tests. As laboratory tests are sometimes time-consuming and expensive, several computer simulations (Durability Models of Concrete Model “DuCOM” by Maekawa et al. [7], [8], “HYMOSTRUC” by Breugel [9], [10], [11], “μic” by Bishnoi and Scrivener [12], [13], “CEMHYD3D” by Bentz and Garboczi [14], [15]) have been developed to investigate the microstructure of cement paste during the hydration [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. However, each of these simulations focuses on a specific perspective and cannot reflect the overall pore structure characteristics.
Many kinds of experimental tests have been developed to investigate transport properties of cement-based materials, which mainly include permeability, diffusivity and thermal conductivity. As an important hydraulic parameter for characterizing mass transport properties, permeability is one of the most important indicators for the durability of cement-based materials. The diffusion of dissolved harmful chemical species in cement-based materials has a strong correlation with their pore structure, affecting the durability of cement-based materials. Additionally, cement-based materials are sensitive to heterogeneous temperature gradients, which may lead to cracking on a microscopic or macroscopic scale [16]. Therefore, understanding thermal properties of cement-based materials is essential. Although many kinds of experimental techniques have been developed to measure transport properties of cement paste, most of them usually have complex test procedures, and experimental results often exhibit high variability due to the disordered and complicated pore structure [17]. In conclusion, there is no widespread recognition for the test methods of transport properties [4]. In the past decade, with the development of computer technology, many kinds of computer models have been proposed to investigate transport properties of cement paste. In most of the existing models, transport properties are obtained based on relatively mature algorithms [18], [19], e.g. finite element methods, finite difference methods, etc. However, it seems difficult and time-consuming for the modeling and mesh generation of multiscale microstructure of cement paste. Besides, calculations in these models usually require a lot of computing resources and sometimes are hard to achieve convergence, which may result in inaccurate results.
Fortunately, cement paste is a typical fractal material and its pore structure exhibits obvious self-similar fractal features [20]. Fractal models have been developed to investigate transport properties of porous media on the basis of their fractal features [21], [22], [23]. It has been extensively validated that the utilization of fractal models for transport property analysis are efficient and reliable [24], [25], [26]. However, how to identify fractal features of porous media is a big challenge, which limits the application of fractal models. In most of previous studies, fractal features of porous media are detected by either image analysis techniques e.g. small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) [27], scanning electron microscopy (SEM) [28], computed tomography (CT) scan [29], [30] or pore network analysis via experimental tests [31], [32]. However, these methods always require complex specimen preparations and test procedures.
This work aims to present a feasible computer simulation to predict the evolution of microstructure and transport properties of cement paste with acceptable accuracy and computing time. Firstly, a computer-based simulation associated with the microstructure of cement paste is constructed. In this simulation, volume of each constituent phases of cement paste can be calculated based on the given volume stoichiometry factor (kh), water to cement ratio (w/c) and hydration degree (α). Simulation algorithm is illustrated in detail and proved to be efficient. Simulated results are comprehensively analyzed, and verified with those from experimental tests and other simulations. Then, fractal features of cement paste are directly obtained through the simulated microstructure. The evolution of fractal features with porosity is verified by literature results. Finally, fractal models are adopted to predict transport properties of cement paste, including permeability, diffusivity, and thermal conductivity. The evolution of transport properties with age, hydration degree and porosity is comprehensively analyzed. For the verification of fractal models, experimental data and results from other models in literature are adopted to make comparisons.
