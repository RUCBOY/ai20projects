Metal matrix – particle reinforced composites have generated considerable recent research interest [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. They are one of the advanced materials widely used for aerospace, automotive, defence, and general engineering applications. These materials can be tailored to have superior properties than those of unreinforced alloys. To fabricate such composites with ideal properties, the processing technique should ensure suitable volume fraction of reinforcement incorporation, uniform distribution of the reinforcement, and acceptable adhesion between the matrix and the reinforcing phase. Especially, the reinforcement/matrix interface plays a significant role in determining the fracture behavior and mechanical properties of metal matrix composites. Its basic function is to transfer the load across the boundary. Therefore, the interfacial bond strongly influences matrix cracking and composite-fracture behavior.
Unfortunately, the important role of the interface is often omitted in the numerical and analytical models [9], [10], [11] and the interface is assumed to be perfect. Although, there are many models that take the imperfect interface between constituents of composites and delamination into consideration [12], [13], [14], usually they are not applied for the metal matrix composites. There are also models in which the interface is implemented as a thin layer between the constituents with different mechanical properties [15], [16]. In this case, delamination is not taken into consideration. Unfortunately, this simplification in many cases may have significant implications and may lead to incorrectness of the simulations results. It is due to the fact that interface damage is one of the predominant forms of failure in many types of metal matrix composites. For example, this problem occurs for very promising metal matrix composites – Cu-SiC composites. In these materials the decomposition of SiC at elevated temperature leads to the diffusion of Si into the copper matrix and the creation of remaining carbon layer which prevents sufficient interfacial bonding [17]. Additionally, carbon does not react with copper and has low coefficient of friction [18] which further reduces the strength of this interface. According to [19] the interfacial bonding strength between Cu and SiC in this type of composites is equal to 54 ± 5 MPa. It should be noted that copper yield strength is approximately 70 MPa and its ultimate tensile strength is 220 MPa. These parameters are even higher for SiC. Hence, the delamination and the degradation of these materials can occur for much lower stress than is usually assumed.
Another example of materials in which the interface bonding strength should be always taken into consideration are codeposited Ni-SiC composites. Due to the fact that no chemical reaction occurs between nickel and silicon carbide during electrodeposition and particles are simply absorbed by growing nickel film, the normal and shear interfacial bonding strengths may be low and may significantly influence the mechanical properties of the material. For example Kodandarama et al. performed tensile tests of three samples made of Ni-SiC composites, with percentage weight of SiC reinforcement as follows: 2.13%, 3.78% and 4.25% [20]. In this work the highest Young’s modulus and ultimate tensile strength is observed for 3.78% of SiC. One could expect that at least Young’s modulus should increase with the increase of SiC particles concentration. Similar effect has been observed by Zimermann et al. [21] – the strength decreases for amount of SiC higher than 2%.
Therefore, the aim of this paper is to show that the weak interface bonding strength and delamination can significantly influence the mechanical properties of the metal matrix – ceramic particles reinforced composites and that even simple cohesive zone models can be very useful for the numerical modelling of these materials. In this work, the samples made of coelectrodeposited Ni-SiC composites with 10% of SiC with weak interfacial bonding have been prepared and then the tensile tests of samples have been performed. Furthermore, the technique, previously described by Jarzabek et al. [22] and further developed here, has been applied for measurement of the normal interfacial bonding strength of SiC particles and Ni matrix. The shear strength has been measured by modified pull-out test. Finally, the experimental results have been used in a finite element model of Ni-SiC composite and the mechanical properties of the material obtained by computer simulations and tensile tests have been compared.
