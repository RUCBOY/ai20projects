Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery is one of the most frequently performed orthopedic interventions. This procedure has many goals, among which pain reduction and the gain of joint mobility are noteworthy.1, 2 The main cause of failure in TKA continues to be poor alignment of the prosthetic components.3
Preoperative surgical planning may contribute to a shorter surgical procedure and longer survival of the prosthetic implants. During planning, the surgeon usually estimates the anatomical and mechanical axes of the femoral and tibial bones. The angle formed between the anatomic and mechanical axes of the femur (AMFA) is also measured, and the bone cutting planes are estimated.4
There are several methods of estimating bone alignment, including clinical examination, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), conventional knee radiographs (CKR), fluoroscopy, and intraoperative navigation. The use of lower limb panoramic radiography (LLPR) is a well-established method for measuring bone alignment.5 The manual preoperative planning uses marking and measuring instruments, such as a 2B pencil, a 50Â cm ruler, a protractor, and a negatoscope, as well as printed radiographs. These tools may not be widely available in all environments where surgical planning occurs.
In turn, with the increase in the number of computing resources applied to healthcare (mHealth), various solutions have been developed in order to assist the surgeon in his routine. This study is aimed at evaluating whether the mobile application, developed by the present authors, was useful in TKA planning and was capable of making an accurate measurement of the AMFA. The preoperative planning time, both manually and through the application, was also compared, and the speed of planning through the application was ultimately evaluated.
