Commonly used methods for the pore structure characterization of macro porous membranes, like e.g. permeability, capillary flow porometry [1], [2], [3], [4], BET-analysis [5] or Bubble Point measurements [6], [7] produce integral structure parameters that do not give locally resolved information. Although this information is quite important as it often correlates with the performance of the membrane, local structure information, especially along the thickness of the membrane, can be very helpful for the full consideration of this performance. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and CLSM image analysis of differently prepared membrane samples have been used to generate locally resolved structural information [8], [9], [10], however, due to the 2D character of SEM imaging techniques and the reported 2D CLSM images, where only a single optical section was recorded, a quantitative evaluation of pore structure is not possible. Based on different methods of 3D structure imaging and image analysis, alternative techniques have been developed, like x-ray diffraction [10], imaging of resin filled membranes [11], [12], [13], or CLSM, by recording a series of single optical sections, as proposed by Charcosset et.al. [14], [15]. All these techniques are limited in their ability to extract quantitative structural information from the images. Sample preparation usually requires artificial conditioning far from the application. The aim of this work is to generate a sufficiently resolved 3D representation of commercial lateral flow membranes [16], [17] under application relevant conditions in order to extract quantitative structural information and to enable enhanced structure-performance correlations. CLSM combined with computer-assisted image evaluation was employed to generate 3D representations of a fluorescently labeled macroporous nitrocellulose membrane. Using an algorithm that is based on a signed distance function and the generated medial axis for each pore, spheres can be fitted into the porous 3D structure. Using the size distribution of these spheres, the pore size distribution of the membrane can be determined on a local level. In order to validate the 3D representation obtained by CLSM, the structural characteristics obtained by computer-based image analysis i.e. specific surface area, pore size distribution, permeability of the membrane, are compared to experimental values. In this study, a commercial available phase inversion, macroporous nitrocellulose membrane is investigated. This membrane is commonly used in lateral flow immunoassays like e.g. the home pregnancy test. Due to their simple layout, lateral flow immunoassays are also used in the field of infectious diseases, drugs of abuse and oncology where the macroporous phase inversion nitrocellulose membrane is responsible for a capillary driven transport of a sample fluid. Since nitrocellulose membranes exhibit relatively high binding capacity for proteins without affecting the activity of the bound protein, antibodies can be printed onto the membrane [16], [17]. The phase inversion derived membrane exhibits a highly porous and complex microstructure (see Fig. 1).Download : Download high-res image (302KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.
