Several scientometric studies have used cited references data for measuring novelty or creativity in science (e.g. Uzzi, Mukherjee, Stringer, & Jones, 2013; Wang, Veugelers, & Stephan, 2017). The general idea here is that if a paper contains many unusual combinations of cited references, the creative potential of the paper is high (Uzzi et al., 2013). Unusual combinations are those which can rarely be found in other publications. Uzzi et al. (2013) claim that combinations of atypical with conventional knowledge (reflected in unusual combinations) may lead to innovativeness (reflected in high impact papers). Therefore, creativity in science can be considered almost a universal phenomenon of conventionality and novelty (Uzzi et al., 2013). However, it is still not clear whether this approach of using cited references for measuring creativity is valid. The empirical studies based on patent data suggest that cited references might not have this prominent role (Callaert, Pellens, & Van Looy, 2014; Nagaoka & Yamauchi, 2015). We are not aware of any study which has similarly tested the approach for publications and cited references. The extent to which cited publications are the sources of inspiration leading to current landmark papers is not yet well understood. Thus, using exemplary landmark papers from the field of scientometrics, this study explores whether the creative potential of a paper is really reflected in its cited references or not.
