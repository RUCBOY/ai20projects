Understanding the processes of macromolecules adsorption on the liquid-liquid interface is important for solving different technological problems and an insight into biological systems functioning [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Concentration of the polymers on the surface and their migration from one liquid to another occurs at liquid extraction and emulsification [1], [2], [3], [4], at creation of protective coatings [5], [6], systems for nanocapsulation and nanocontainers [7], [8], in the process of successive solvent displacement [9].
In the mixture of two incompatible liquids, macromolecules can stay in one solvent or locate at the interphase boundary depending on the presence of amphiphilic groups, which selectively interact with the liquids, their affinity to each liquid and relative content. The distribution of such groups in macromolecular chain is among the key factors [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16] of polymer repartition between the liquids as well.
Surface activity, i.e. tendency to be concentrated at the interphase boundary, is characteristic for biological macromolecules, especially lipids [9], [17], but also for DNA, RNA, proteins [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. For example, the well-known ssDNA phenol emulsion reassociation technique (PERT) is based on the accumulation of ssDNA on the water/organic solvent interface due to the structure of nucleotide composed of water soluble sugar-phosphate backbone and hydrophobic nucleobases [4], [18], [19], [20]. One can say that ssDNA is amphiphilic at the level of each monomer unit. Many water soluble synthetic polymers have amphiphilic monomer units as well [25], [26]. Basic feature of such monomer units is their effective surface activity forcing them to be placed at the interface. This feature, as it was shown in [27], can be accounted for by a A-graft-B model. In this model a monomer unit is presented as a “dumbbell” of two beads – hydrophobic A and hydrophilic (polar) B, connected by a fixed-length bond. Amphiphilic A-graft-B units form a chain with A backbone and B groups as pendants. The amphiphilic homopolymers, composed of identical amphiphilic A-graft-B monomer units, have particular conformational properties [26], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38] and since recently attract considerable attention due to wide possibilities of their practical applications [26], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. Such macromolecules in emulsions can efficiently self-assemble into the vesicles with membrane-like walls for encapsulation of various substances [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44].
In [16], adsorption of a single (A-graft-B)N macromolecule at the interface of two immiscible liquids, selectively interacting with A and B groups (ξ is the selectivity parameter), was studied by means of computer simulation. To distinguish the effect of the architecture of the chain on adsorption, a generally accepted symmetric case with energetically equal affinity and repulsion of different groups to different solvents was studied [13], [14], [45], [46], [47]. Under such assumptions, the selectivity parameter ξ was defined as the additional energy that A or B group get in one of the coexisting solvents that is poor for this particular type of groups. All the regimes previously established for AB copolymers at the symmetric interface were highlighted [13], [14] and the transition values ξc and ξ∞ were found. Those are the regime of a non-adsorbed macromolecule unaffected by the presence of the interface (ξ < ξc), weak localization regime, where macromolecule is partially adsorbed and its size gradually changes from that of 3D to that of 2D coil (ξc < ξ < ξ∞), and strong localization regime, where the macromolecule is completely flattened along the interface (ξ > ξ∞).
It was demonstrated that the behavior of such (A-graft-B)N macromolecules obeys the same scaling laws as adsorption of alternating (AB)N copolymers, but with lower values of numerical prefactors. The values of ξc depend on the polymer length N, and the values of ξ∞ are independent on N. Thus, transition into weak localization regime occurs at ξc ~ 2.6/N1/5 for (A-graft-B)N macromolecules (whereas for alternating copolymers ξc ~ 4/N1/5), and into strong localization regime at ξ∞~1.8 and ξ∞~4.35, respectively. That is, the lower values of the selectivity parameter are enough for amphiphilic homopolymers to be adsorbed at the liquid–liquid interface.
For multiblock copolymers, the transition values of the selectivity parameter ξ obey the scaling laws that include the block length nb: ξc ~ nb−4/5N−1/5, ξ∞~ nb−1 [14], [45]. For random copolymers, the scaling variable N1/2 appears instead of N1/5: ξc ~ N−1/2 [13] indicating significant adsorption weakness of such macromolecules.
It was shown that multichain adsorption of random copolymers [46], [47] revealed two regimes depending on polymer concentration. In low concentration regime (undersaturated surface regime), with the increase of the total amount of polymer in the system, the interface coverage grows. In the second regime (oversaturated surface regime), the interface is fully covered with polymer, however, polymer concentration in the interfacial layer continues to grow with the increase of the average polymer concentration, since it is possible to accumulate more chains at the interface by squeezing polymer chains and forming stretched hairpin-like loops.
This paper aims to study the multichain adsorption of (A-graft-B)N macromolecules as a function of polymer concentration and to distinguish different regimes [45], [46], [47], [48], [49], [50] in terms of the occupation of the interface layer and the spatial redistribution of the chains upon the increase of concentration. The structure of interfacial layer formed by (A-graft-B)N amphiphilic homopolymer is compared to that of copolymers with random, alternating and multiblock distribution of A and B groups.
