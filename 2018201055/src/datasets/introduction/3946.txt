Corn is the most important grain crop globally, used for human food, livestock feed and biofuel (ethanol production). Over 36% of global corn production is in the USA, largely within the Midwest Corn Belt (Ort and Long, 2014). The Corn Belt is generally considered the region of the USA extending across 12 Midwest states (Panagopoulos et al., 2015), largely planted in a corn-soybean rotation (Suyker and Verma, 2012). Even though maps of the Corn Belt and corn production areas date back to the year 1919 (Baker, 1927), the term “Corn Belt” is often subjectively defined and therefore geospatially variable. It has been coarsely identified by whole states with the greatest areas of corn (Daloǧlu et al., 2014, Grassini et al., 2014, Kellner et al., 2016, Tan and Liu, 2015). Others have identified a Western Corn Belt (Grassini et al., 2011, Morell et al., 2016, Sahajpal et al., 2014, Wimberly et al., 2017, Wright and Wimberly, 2013) and an Eastern Corn Belt (Auch and Laingen, 2015, Kellner et al., 2016) in the Midwest. Many studies within the region make no attempt to define the Corn Belt (Angel et al., 2017, Golecha and Gan, 2016, Liu et al., 2016, McLaughlin and Reckhow, 2017, Turhollow et al., 2014). Thus, one may be left asking, “What is the Corn Belt, where is it currently, and how is it changing?”
A few key studies have given geographical delineations of the Corn Belt. The USDA published a 1949 map of the Corn Belt as a contiguous region of the Midwest classified as predominantly “feed grains and livestock” (Bureau of Agricultural Economics, 1950). Later, Hart (1986) published a geospatial map of the Midwest Corn Belt in 1982 using county level statistics for corn acreage. He also mapped a soybean belt and changes in corn acreage from 1949 to 1982. Hart noted, “The transformation of the Corn Belt began in 1933 when hybrid seed corn was introduced, but it did not really take off until after World War II.” Laingen (2012) published an overlay of the contiguous Corn Belt geometries in 1919 (Baker, 1927) and 1949 (Bureau of Agricultural Economics, 1950) while providing an historical perspective of the term “Corn Belt” being first printed in 1882. Laingen (2012) then delineated the 2007 Corn Belt and analyzed changes from 1949 to 2007 in the geospatial area of corn. Finally, Metson et al. (2016) based a map of the Corn Belt on the criterion of corn grain and silage production exceeding 200 kg per km2 of land area. They used corn production data from the year circa-2000 (Monfreda et al., 2008), then applied a spatial filter to smooth the resulting shape. Their Corn Belt region was delineated to estimate transportation distances for phosphorus fertilizers.
There remains a need for an efficient, standardized yet flexible geospatial framework to quantify the Corn Belt in space and time for application to science, management, economics and policy issues. Others have developed advanced methods for classifying landcover from remotely sensed (Landsat) hyperspectral multi-temporal imagery (Yan and Roy, 2015) and delineating geometries of field boundaries (Yan and Roy, 2014, Yan and Roy, 2016). Here, we use available data (see Methods below) and publically available web services to quantify the intensity of corn areas at the county level, for example. The present objectives are to:
1.Map a recent (2010–2016) geospatial example of the Corn Belt (areas planted in corn above selected thresholds) and demonstrate its space-time dynamics,2.provide publically accessible technical methods in a computationally efficient web-based tool to repeat the analyses for different time periods of interest and user-specified thresholds, and3.illustrate potential interactions between the mapped Corn Belt and irrigated areas.
