Liver is the largest internal organ in the body. It neutralizes toxins, assists in the processing of proteins and fats from digested food, keeps important nutrients, and produces and secretes bile [1,2].
According to the American Cancer Society, liver cancer is the 8th leading cause of cancer related death in women and 5th in men worldwide [3]. The death rates due to liver cancer have tripled since the year 2000. One of the reasons is the lack of tools to detect early symptoms of the disease [4], and hence many patients are diagnosed with liver cancer in an advanced stage. Lesions of the liver are often found by chance during a routine check-up with ultrasound examination [5]. Thus, differentiating the lesion type at the time of diagnosis can be beneficial to the patients. Focal liver lesions can either be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). Examples of benign lesions are liver cysts, liver abscesses, hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia, and hepatic adenoma [6]. Malignant lesions are hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma, biliary cystadenocarcinoma, and lesions from metastases (MET) originating from cancers in other organs [6]. Preexisting conditions such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis can increase the risk of developing a liver cancer [7].
Histopathological examination (HPE) of a biopsy sample is the gold standard to characterize a liver lesion. However, biopsy is an invasive and costly surgical procedure. Ultrasound imaging has been used as a common diagnostic tool for initial diagnosis of the liver because it is non-invasive, non-ionizing and cost-effective. However, it is difficult for radiologists to determine the nature of the lesion based on the images alone. To overcome this shortcoming, we developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to aid in the characterization of liver lesion using ultrasound images.
The literature review on the development of CAD systems to discriminate between the different liver lesions is scarce (see Table 1). Aside these papers, there are also CAD systems developed for fatty liver disease and cirrhosis [8]. Acharya et al. [[9], [10], [11], [12]] investigated multiple techniques to develop a robust algorithm to assist in the early diagnosis of liver diseases such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. Having a CAD system to detect liver lesions at an early stage could be helpful in identifying the severity of the lesions, including cancer at earliest possible time [8].Table 1.

Several authors have used contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) images for the identification of focal liver lesions [[13], [14], [15]]. A few CAD systems were also developed using CEUS images. Sugimoto et al. [16] and Shiraishi et al. [17] used CEUS images for the automated identification of focal liver lesions.
In this work, we proposed to develop an automated CAD system for the classification of liver lesions into normal, benign, and malignant classes using conventional ultrasound images. CEUS images were not considered in this work as the examination is invasive and involves additional costs to the patients. In most countries, CEUS is performed as the second-line imaging method after inconclusive baseline ultrasound for the diagnosis of benign focal liver lesions [18].
