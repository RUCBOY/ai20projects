The technology of digital images has great impact in diagnosis of certain diseases in medical systems. With the combination of digital images and Internet, great improvement in health protection has been achieved [1]. Digital images have several usages in medical diagnostics such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Moreover, there are several techniques that are used with digital images such as noise detection, noise deletion, feature extraction, image segmentation, watermarking, and image compression. Health care systems are among the medical systems that use patients’ digital images with high privacy [1], [2].
In medical images adjacent pixels are strongly correlated but current image encryption algorithms are not powerful enough for proper image encryption thus, researchers tend to propose highly reliable image encryption algorithms [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Optical Encryption approach is an efficient image encryption method, which has been inspired from mathematical transform techniques such as fractional Fourier, discrete fractional Fourier, Fresnel, and etc. [2], [11], [12], [13], [14].
There are many directions and trends for the usage of chaos-based image encryption methods in the literature [4], [6], [15], [16], [17], [18], especially when security is a matter of concern. Permutation and diffusion are the two main steps in chaos-based image encryption [7]. In permutation pixels’ gray level are not changed and chaotic map reallocates image pixels. Next, chaos sequence is used to change the value of each pixel in diffusion step. Most of the chaos-based encryptions algorithms assign the parameter μ of the logistic map close to 4 (μ=3.99), which can ensure the chaotic behavior of the logistic map. Thus, the limitation in the range of μ ∈ (0, 4] indicates that the keystream generated from the chaotic sequences in the logistic map is vulnerable. One of the recently proposed chaotic map is coupled lattice map (CLM) which is more secure in comparison with the conventional lattice maps [19].
There have recently been proposed evolutionary algorithm-based image encryption techniques [5], [6], [8]. Specifically, Abdullah et al. proposed a genetic algorithm-based optimization approach for finding the best solutions at the end of each iteration [5]. First, the presented approach has been initiated with certain number of cipher-images generated using chaotic maps. Next, GA has been used to modify the cipher-images in order to achieve a cipher-image with the highest entropy and lowest correlation coefficient. There are some other evolutionary algorithm-based approaches for image encryption using same patterns. The category of evolutionary algorithm-based image encryption approaches is time consuming due to alternating iterations, which is one of the main deficiencies of these methods.
In this paper a novel approach has been proposed based on a modified GA (MGA) and coupled lattice map. First, CLM is used for generating secure cipher-images from the plain-images to form the initial population in MGA. Then, GA has been modified by proposing a new local search method as well as determining an experimental stop condition (termination criterion). The proposed modification accelerates convergence in the GA.
The organization of the paper is as follows: First, Section 2 explains CLM and GA. Then, Section 3 introduces the proposed method. Next, Section 4 simulates and analyses the results. Finally, the paper is concluded with overall findings and future works in Section 5.
