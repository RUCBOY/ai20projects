The ever increasing number of wireless devices is imposing considerable demands on the bandwidth allocated to wireless transmission; however, several researchers have reported that licensed spectrum usage remains underutilized [1], [2]. One approach to improving spectrum utilization involves cognitive radio (CR) technology, in which unlicensed users (secondary users, SUs) sense holes in the spectrum and then adjust transceiver parameters to access idle channels. CR networks (CRNs) comprising both licensed nodes (primary users, PUs) and SU nodes are current implemented in accordance with three main paradigms: underlay, overlay, and interweave [3], [4], [5], [6]. When sending a message using the underlay paradigm, the interference generated by the SU must fall within the tolerance range of the PU nodes. Using the overlay paradigm, an SU can assist PU nodes in the transmission of data in exchange for bandwidth. Under the interweave paradigm, an SU is able to use only the spectrum that is currently unoccupied by PUs. Furthermore, in the event that a PU appears, the SU must immediately surrender the bandwidth it is using. This paper addresses the interweave paradigm.
Communication is enabled by having two SU nodes simultaneously switch to the same channel, referred to as a rendezvous. Note that in a CRN, arranging for an SU to rendezvous with any of its neighbors is not a trivial problem. Two methods have been proposed to ensure rendezvous completion: common control channel (CCC) [7], [8], [9], [10], [11] and channel hopping [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. CCC-based schemes negotiate the channels used for data transmission by having the SU nodes transmit control packets on a common control channel (or set of control channels). Channel hopping schemes use a channel hopping algorithm to designate a channel for each time slot. Channel hopping has been widely adopted due to the difficulty in finding a channel that is commonly available to all SU nodes in a CRN.
Existing channel hopping protocols are vulnerable to malicious jamming attacks. Researchers have developed a number of channel hopping schemes aimed at resisting these attacks. These schemes can be classified according to whether the SU nodes are required to share access information (e.g., spreading code or hopping sequence) in advance [21], [22]. They can also be classified according to whether an SU node is pre-assigned to a specific role (i.e., as sender or receiver). Note that schemes based on pre-assigned roles are referred to as symmetric, whereas those without pre-assignment are referred to as asymmetric. Table 1 outlines representative jamming resistance channel hopping schemes based on the classifications above. Note that symmetric schemes using pre-shared access information are impractical for dynamic CRNs in which SU node neighbors change frequently.
Researchers have developed a number of asymmetric schemes that forego the use of pre-shared access information. The Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) approach requires that an SU node assume the role of sender or receiver before initiating communication [23]. Unfortunately, this approach cannot guarantee a successful rendezvous between two senders or between two receivers.
Thus, most existing anti-jamming solutions operate without a priori constraints: i.e., symmetric without pre-shared access information. The uncoordinated frequency hopping scheme (UFH) has senders and receivers follow their own hopping pattern to mitigate jamming threats, and communication links are established when a sender and a receiver switch to the same unjammed channel [24]. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) is an anti-jamming solution that requires perfect knowledge pertaining to the attacker’s strategy [25]. In the event that this knowledge is unavailable, SU nodes running MDP use maximum likelihood estimation and Q-learning schemes to guess the adversary’s strategy. Note that neither UFH nor MDP can guarantee a successful rendezvous between any given pair of nodes. Under the Sec-CH scheme [26], the time operation is divided into multiple consecutive slots of equal duration. There are two types of frame: Transceiving mode frame (T frame) and reception mode frame (R frame). SU nodes can either send or receive packets in T frames, but they can only receive packets in R frames. The channel hopping sequence for a given SU node a is derived from its channel hopping matrix Ma, which includes several columns. Note that a column is a sequence of alternating T and R frames, such that every T frame is followed by an R frame, and vice versa. There are two types of columns: bit-1 (starting with an R frame) and bit-0 (starting with a T frame). Each SU node has a unique binary identifier (ID), and each digit in the ID corresponds to a column. For example, digit 1/0 indicates that a bit-1/bit-0 column is selected. In many scenarios, the Sec-CH protocol works well in terms of time to rendezvous (TTR); however, it lacks the flexibility to function well in all scenarios. As in the Sec-CH scheme, an SU node running Tri-CH also builds a hopping matrix based on its ID [27]. A matrix includes several sub-columns combining J-patterns and S-patterns. In an effort to reduce the maximum time to rendezvous under jamming attack, each SU node is identified using a trinary ID in which each trinary-digit has three possible values (0, 1, or 2) mapped to three different sub-columns. Note that under the Tri-CH scheme, channel usage tends to be uneven and frequently accessed channels are vulnerable to attack.Table 1.

None of the anti-jamming channel hopping schemes mentioned above allows adjustments to the sending/receiving ratio, which is necessary to optimize the operation of networks consisting of SU nodes with uneven traffic loads. In this paper, we proposed a novel anti-jamming scheme, which allows for the sending/receiving ratio to be adjusted dynamically in order to maximize the throughput of an SU node. The proposed scheme, referred to as Load Awareness Anti-jamming channel hopping (LAA), is based on extended Langford pairing (ELP) [28]. In this paper, we extended our preliminary version [29] by numerically proving that the LAA anti-jamming channel hopping protocol can guarantee rendezvous between any pair of nodes. We also report on simulations demonstrating the superiority of LAA over Sec-CH and Tri-CH in terms of throughput and TTR.
