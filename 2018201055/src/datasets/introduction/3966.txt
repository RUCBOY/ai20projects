In most of the images, texture is considered to be the visual impression of coarseness or smoothness caused by the variability or uniformity of the image tone. Thus, the contribution of texture for low level image analysis is considered to be significant [1], [2]. In general, image analysis that is accomplished by characterizing and representing image regions according to their texture content is called texture analysis. An image texture is analyzed to quantify instinctive properties, such as smoothness or coarseness. It is described to be a function of the spatial variation in pixel intensity levels.
Texture-based analysis of images is useful in a variety of applications and has been a subject of deep study by many researchers. In addition, the textural properties of an image are expected to expedite valuable information for analysis in domains such as remote sensing and medical imaging [3], [4]. However, texture-based image analysis has many challenges to be addressed. Primarily, the quality of the image needs to be improved to avoid the misinterpretation of images by the human visual system.
Usually, the quality of an image is improved through successive applications of image enhancement techniques [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], such as contrast stretching, histogram manipulation and unsharp masking. Histogram equalization-based image enhancement methods [8], [9] are appropriate for images that have histograms with only single peak. Other enhancement methods [5], [6], [7] have restrictions for improving image textural features. In addition, these techniques provide major contributions for improving the statistical features such as mean and standard deviation of an image but only provide small improvements for textural features. Thus, a specific image enhancement technique is required as a pre-processing step that improves the textural features in images.
By visual interpretation, it is noticed that texture features are sharp details in images and it is inferred that differential operators may be considered for highlighting the textural information in images. Basically, first and second order differential operators such as gradient and Laplacian operators are used to highlight the edges and boundaries in images. It was also proved in the recent literature that fractional differential operators [10], [11], [12] are found to be more appropriate for image textural features than integral differential operators. Thus, fractional differential operators are considered for texture enhancement in images.
FD operators used in many image processing applications are devised in the form of filters to be operated on smaller neighborhoods in images; however, these filters do not include auto-correlation features that exist between pixels in a neighborhood. The detection of texture features using autocorrelation function is already proved in [13], [14]. The existing texture analysis measures are thoroughly reviewed in [15], among which autocorrelation feature is formulated as one of the noteworthy texture measures. Hence, an attempt is made in this work to improve the G-L fractional differential filter by incorporating auto-correlation effect between neighbouring pixels.
The efficacy of the proposed FD operator needs to be proved using a texture characterization procedure. For texture characterization, various texture analysis approaches exist in the literature [1], [2], [16], [17], [18], [19], [3], [4], where the spatial localities and rate of occurrences of intensity level differences pertaining to the image texture features are classified and categorized. Most researchers consider the process of texture analysis to be a process of texture segmentation [16], [17], where the different regions of an image are treated as different texture classes, leading to a multi-texture segmentation problem. On comparing with approaches such as wavelet domain, Fourier domain, and statistical and structural methodologies of texture analysis, Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) method is found to be better for quantifying the image textural features [1]. Hence, the performance of the proposed texture enhancement filter is demonstrated using GLCM method. Therefore, modified G-L fractional differential operator is proposed for texture enhancement in images and the enhancement is quantified using the GLCM measures contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: The review of the related work is detailed in Section 2. The essential hypothetical background of the G-L definition of fractional differential is reviewed in Section 3 and the modified fractional differential filter is built in Section 4. Experimental results of the proposed method on test images are discussed in Section 5. The work is concluded in Section 6.
