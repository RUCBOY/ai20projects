The fringe projection for 3D shape measurement has the advantages of non-contact, high accuracy, fast speed, and automated measurement. The Fourier transform profilometry (FTP) in fringe projection is widely used in online quality inspection of mechanical components, dress making, medical diagnostics, and so on [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].
In the 3D shape measurement, it is difficult to measure the object height by using only one grating owing to the difficulty of phase unwrapping. Hence many researchers used the suitable dual-frequency grating to combine the advantages of the low-frequency grating and the high-frequency grating [11], [12], [13]. Peng K et al proposed a dual-frequency online phase measurement profilometry method with phase-shifting parallel to moving direction of measured object [11]. Dai M et al proposed a dual-frequency fringe projection system for 3D surface shape measurement. In their method, they use low-frequency fringe patterns to guarantee the accuracy of low-frequency phase for high-frequency phase unwrapping [12].
However, due to the gamma nonlinearity effects of the projector system, the measurement accuracy of the 3D shape will be affected. The correction of gamma nonlinearity is very important in fringe projection 3D shape measurement [13], [14], [15], [16]. Ma S et al proposed a fast and accurate gamma correction technique based on a Fourier spectrum analysis. In this method, only two spatial-carrier fringe patterns with different pre-encoded gamma values are needed and the number of fringe patterns required for gamma pre-calibration is significantly reduced without loss of accuracy [15]. Xiao Y et al used an orthogonal sinusoidal grating pre-coded with two different known gamma values to evaluate the gamma value of the pattern. In their method, the captured fringe patterns are well-sinusoidal and the phase errors caused by the gamma nonlinearity are alleviated [16]. To avoid the nonlinear gamma of the projector during the course of the measurement of steep objects, Fu Y et al generated the dual-frequency fringe through software programming based on defocusing, so the fundamental frequency and the third harmonic components can be preserved [13].
There is still a challenge to measure steep or complex object shape by fringe projection technique. We propose a novel dual-frequency grating projection method for steep and complex object shape measurement and discuss the condition of correction of gamma nonlinearity for digital projector. The proposed method is validated by computer simulation and experiments.
