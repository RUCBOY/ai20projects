Astronomical datasets are constantly increasing in size and complexity. The modern generation of integral field units (IFUs) are generating about 60 GB of data per night while imaging instruments are generating 300 GB per night. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST; Ivezic et al., 2008) is under construction in Chile and it is expected to start full operations in 2022. With a wide 9.6 square degree field of view 3.2 Gigapixel camera, LSST will generate about 20 TB of data per night and will detect more than 20 million of galaxies.
Machine learning techniques have been increasingly employed in data-rich areas of science. They have been used in genomics, high-energy physics and astronomy. Some examples in astronomy are the detection of weird galaxies using Random Forests on Sloan data (Baron and Poznanski, 2017), Gravity Spy (Zevin et al., 2017) for LIGO detections and using convolutional neural network (CNN) in identifying strong lenses in imaging data (Jacobs et al., 2017).
Computer Vision is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on how machines can emulate the way in which human’s brains and eyes work together to visually process the world around them. For many years, the detection of objects was computed using manual feature engineering and descriptors such as SIFT and HOG (Dalal and Triggs, 2005). Thanks to the advent of large annotated datasets and gains in computing power, deep learning methods have become the favorite for doing detection and classification of objects.Table 1.

The classification of optical galaxy morphologies is based on a few simple rules that make them suitable for machine learning and computer vision techniques. The Kaggle Galaxy Zoo (Willett et al., 2013) was a competition based on a citizen science project where the aim was to predict the probability distribution of people’s responses about the morphology of a galaxy using optical image data, and the winning solution used CNNs (Dieleman et al., 2015).
We present a method for galaxy classification and identification with a novel data augmentation procedure which is part of AstroCV, a computer vision library for processing and analyzing big astronomical datasets. The goal of AstroCV is to provide a community repository for fast Python and C++ implementations of common tools and routines used in the areas of image processing and computer vision. In particular, it is focused on the task of object detection, segmentation and classification applied to astronomical sources.
In this paper we will focus onthe automatic detection and classification of galaxies. The detection and classification methods were trained end-to-end using public datasets from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), (Alam et al., 2015), and Galaxy Zoo Lintott et al., 2008, Lintott et al., 2011 explained in Section 2.1. We use YOLO method, (Redmon et al., 2015), for object detection which is explained in Section 2.2. Training process is described in Section 2.3, and results are shown in Section 3.
The open source code, training datasets, documentation and python notebooks of AstroCV are freely available in a Github repository.1
