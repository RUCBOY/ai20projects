The assessment of agreement has received considerable attention in the context of method comparison studies [[1], [2], [3]]. In particular, the Bland-Altman analysis [4,5] for evaluating agreement between two methods of clinical measurement has been extensively applied in biological and medical research. It was emphasized in [6] that the Bland-Altman analysis is widely used in ophthalmology research. The paper [4] has been heavily cited in three major ophthalmic journals: Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science (more than 441 citing articles), Optometry and Vision Science (more than 338 citing articles), and Ophthalmic and Physiological Optics (more than 184 citing articles) as of June 20, 2018. Overall, the article [4] has since been cited more than 40,728 and 30,412 times in Google Scholar and Web of Science, respectively. Moreover, the citations of [5] are 5,875 and 4,090 in Google Scholar and Web of Science. It is also the most frequently cited paper in Statistical Methods in Medical Research as noted in Ref. [7].
To appraise the comparability between measurement methods, the Bland and Altman 95% limits of agreement are comprised of the 2.5 t h percentile and 97.5 t h percentile for the distribution of the difference between paired measurements. Accordingly, the estimation of the two particular percentiles has important implications in determining the reference range for assessing agreement. The practical usage of percentiles is often characterized by a normal distribution. There are various parametric and nonparametric methods available for obtaining point estimates of normal percentiles. For example, [8] compared the unbiased estimator and several potential formulas with respect to performance characteristics of bias and mean square error. More advanced and theoretical investigations of normal percentile estimators can be found in Refs. [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]].
To accommodate the uncertainty due to sampling error in point estimation, approximate interval formulas were presented in Refs. [4,5] for estimating the normal percentiles. The approximate confidence intervals are computationally simple and do not require specialized software because they only involve the quantiles of a regular t distribution. The large number of citations revealed that the Bland-Altman procedure has become the major technique for assessing the method comparability. Exact interval procedure of normal percentiles has been well documented in the literature, such as [[15], [16], [17]]. It is important to note that the recent work of [6] and [18] recommended the exact confidence interval over the approximate procedure considered in Refs. [4,5]. Specifically, the comprehensive examinations of [18] revealed that, despite the simplicity and symmetry features, the two individual endpoints of the approximate confidence intervals generally do not maintain the assumption of equal-tailed error rates, especially when the sample sizes are small.
Although the point and interval estimation of percentiles are useful in their own right, the reference range or percentile range between the two paired-percentiles of the central proportion, such as the 2.5 t h and 97.5 t h percentiles, has an important role in representing the plausible scope of the population of interest. Accordingly, the Bland-Altman limits of agreement are usually viewed as a pair of bound for measuring agreement in method comparison studies. It is highly desirable, therefore, to obtain a single confidence interval to cover both limits of agreement simultaneously. This interval estimation problem for the range of agreement or the reference range of the lower and upper limits of agreement has recently been considered in Refs. [6] and [19]. Using the conventional two-sided tolerance interval procedure, [6] computed the inner and outer tolerance intervals to estimate the range of agreement. The joint interval method of [6] consists of two tolerance intervals with four endpoints, and thus the reference range of percentiles lies outside the inner confidence interval and inside the outer confidence interval with the chosen confidence level. However, [19] suggested that it is more appropriate to apply the outer confidence limits of the approximate confidence intervals of [4,5] than the ordinary tolerance interval procedure.
It is noteworthy that [19] emphasized the different motivations and usages of interval methods for the assessment of measurement agreement. In particular, the point estimates and prediction intervals of the limits of agreement are not suitable for estimating the range of agreement. More importantly, the evaluation based on a tolerance interval is weaker than that based on the outer confidence limits because the tolerance interval is designated to cover any reference range with the selected proportion value, not just the central proportion. Also, [7] gave detailed discussion of the fundamental discrepancy between the endpoints of the joint tolerance intervals and outer approximate confidence intervals described in Refs. [6] and [19], respectively. It appears to be a lack of consensus in the literature on which interval method is most appropriate for estimating the range of agreement. In view of the approximate nature of the outer confidence intervals and the relax requirement of the conventional tolerance intervals, the methods suggested in Refs. [6] and [19] are subject to further appraisal.
The aim of this article is to provide clear guidance on the use of accurate confidence intervals of the range of agreement. Both analytic examinations and numerical investigations are presented to justify the features of the suggested equal-tailed tolerance intervals and the nearly exact interval method based on the outer confidence limits of the exact confidence intervals of the two individual limits of agreement. In the process, the theoretical arguments and empirical appraisals help to illustrate the drawbacks of the currently suggested methods for conducting confidence interval estimation of the range of agreement. For the purpose of design planning, the corresponding sample size calculations for precise interval estimation of the range of agreement are delineated. The desired precision of a confidence interval is assessed with respect to the control of expected half-width, and to the assurance probability of interval half-width within a designated threshold. To enhance the utility of the suggested methodology in practical applications, both SAS/IML [20] and R [21] computer algorithms are presented to facilitate the implementation of the confidence interval and sample size computations.
