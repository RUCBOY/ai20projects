Human action recognition has effortlessly gained a lot attention of the researchers due to its inevitable contribution in video surveillance, sports video analysis,human computer interaction, video analysis and many more. The application of depth cameras for capturing the human-object interaction has given a new dimension for better analysis. The temporal relationship among different actions performed by human to accomplish a task requires continuous monitoring of intra-class variations which is challenging task. Tracking human actions kinematically is another important task. The challenge is to differentiate the poses and appearance that appears to be similar while performing different tasks. Another challenge involves where active appearance is sensitive to illumination and view.

A number of gestures are formed representing different messages for example quick head movements can be treated as a sign of surprise or alarm, visual attention of communication among group of people can be interpreted. Speech recognition is one of the major and vast areas of head pose estimation that includes identification of the messages from the people who are impaired of speaking and listening. Such applications may neutralize the gap between the common people to the handicapped one. Moreover, this approach can be applied for vehicular safety measure so that accidents occurrence due to unawareness of the vehicle pilot can be rectified by alarming uncertain situations.
