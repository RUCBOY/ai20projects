From smart lightbulbs, fridges and baby monitors to Raspberry Pi boards and implantable medical devices: all of these devices can be connected to the Internet with ease [1]. Such devices, Internet of Things (IoTs), have received more and more attentions with the development of society and economy [2]. However, managements of IoTs often suffer from extremely constrained processing and storage resources. In order to overcome such limitations in IoTs, one of the most promising approaches is to interconnect the IoTs with the cloud services [3]. Cloud computing has been playing a supporting role in IoTs, which is called cloud-based IoTs [[4], [5], [6]].
One of the most important cloud-based IoT services is Azure service like IoT Hub and Event Hub [7]. They manage, monitor and connect billions of IoT assets and provide services of cloud-scale telemetry ingestion from mobile apps, Internet websites and any streams of data. Such cloud-based IoTs help retain the confidentiality of both device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messages by setting up individual identities and credentials for each IoT devices.
As recently been emphasized by two American institutes, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and National Security Agency (NSA), there has been an increasing need for signature schemes being secure against quantum computer attacks, since RSA [8], ECC [[9], [10]] and related signature schemes are insecure under quantum computer attacks [[11], [12]]. Correspondingly, such cloud-based IoTs that use RSA and ECC signatures for the authentication of individual identities and credentials have become insecure [13].
To ensure the authentication of individual identities and credentials in the cloud-based IoTs under quantum computer attacks, there is a critical need for implementations of new quantum-resistance signature systems, such as Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV), for making the cloud-based IoTs more secure and reliable. UOV is one of the multivariate signature schemes, which has become a dynamic research area, as reflected by the ever growing number of researches in the most famous cryptographic journals and conferences [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]]. The security of UOV signature schemes is based on the Multivariate Quadratic (MQ) problem: Given a system P=(p(0),p(1),…,p(m−1)) of m nonlinear polynomial quadratic equations on the variables x0,x1,…,xn−1, find values x0,x1,…,xn−1 such that p(0)(x0,x1,…,xn−1)=0,p(1)(x0,x1,…,xn−1)=0,…,p(m−1)(x0,x1,…,xn−1)=0 [20]. Since the MQ problem has been proven to be NP-complete and is immune to the attacks by quantum computers, the implementations and applications of UOV have been one of the focuses in areas of cryptography and engineering [[21], [22], [23], [24], [25]].
Although UOV with the suitable parameters is secure against traditional computer attacks and quantum computer attacks, the implementations of UOV, especially implementations on could, IoTs and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), are susceptible to side channel attacks [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39]]. Such attacks make use of physical leakages emanating from the signature generations of public key cryptographic systems, while it performs a secret-key related operation, or exploits logical errors induced during secret-key related operations to retrieve the secret keys.
We present an efficient algorithm based on side channel analysis of UOV in this paper, which has a security level of not smaller than 80 bits. We implement UOV signature schemes on Sakura-G FPGA board via using Verilog-HDL code and Xilinx ISE software, where the power collection uses a 350 MHz Keysights oscilloscope (DSOX3034T). Based on the experimental results, we successfully recover all the secret keys of UOV signature, which shows that we should protect UOV and related signatures against side channel attacks when they are adopted in cloud-based IoTs.
The remaining sections of our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, UOV signature schemes are introduced. In Section 3, we propose an efficient algorithm based on side channel analysis of UOV. In Section 4, we implement UOV schemes on SAKURA-G board and use a Keysights oscilloscope to collect power consumption of UOV implementation. By using the efficient algorithm based on side channel analysis, all secret keys of UOV implementation have been recovered. In Section 5, conclusions are discussed.
