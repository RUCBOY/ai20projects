Saudi Arabia is a developing economy which is experiencing rapid technological growth, and has a relatively recently established higher education sector. While evidence from other countries would suggest that there are benefits to integrating technology enhanced learning within university degree programmes, Saudi Arabian universities have generally not yet done so (Alturise & Alojaiman, 2013). However, improving educational technology provision is a national priority for the future: the King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz Public Education Development Project1 which has invested US$3.1 billion to improve education in Saudi Arabia, aims to “utilize information and communication technology (ICT) in education to stimulate learning”.
This paper uses qualitative and quantitative data to examine the extent to which Saudi Arabian undergraduates currently use technology, both generally and in support of their learning. It also explores students’ attitudes to computers and the factors which influence those attitudes, using a standardised computer attitude scale and focus group data. It contributes data on technology usage patterns within Saudi Arabian university students, which will be of interest to educators and policy makers in that context, and additionally makes a wider contribution to the study of the factors which influence computer attitudes. The strong cultural gender roles in Saudi Arabia give reason to believe that there would be gender differences in attitudes to computers there. Other factors which can influence attitudes include: inequalities in technology infrastructure and socio-economic development in rural areas, parental encouragement and English language proficiency.
