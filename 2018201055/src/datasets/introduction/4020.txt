In recent literature, the effort to understand the mechanisms behind virus propagation has been one of the most important topics due to its significance in the development of antivirus software and magnitude of harm to the Internet. To cope with this problem, one of the imperious topics is to formulate reliable mathematical models that are applicable to effectively provide some insights into the characteristics of virus spread dynamics. Based on a newfangled observation that the diffusion of computer virus is closely similar to the biological epidemics [1], typical epidemiologic compartmental SIS
 (Susceptible–Infected–Susceptible) model and SIR
 (Susceptible–Infected–Recovered) model [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] have been widely used to describe the proliferation dynamics of computer virus. Thereafter, a number of extended models have been proposed based on various perspectives ranging from the virus characteristics such as virus latency [7], [8] and virus infection [9], [10], [11], to the propagation effect of network topology [12], [13]. These models are generally valuable in understanding the spreading dynamics of the computer viruses.
On the other hand, effective and reliable solutions to fight the computer viruses are also a pressing question. In past decades several antivirus models have been developed based on the realistic scenarios such as virus immunization [14], [15], virus control [16], [17], [18], [19] and antivirus ability [20]. Particularly, a novel antivirus mechanism called Kill Signals (KS, the warning for possible virus infection) has been proposed by Kephart et al. in [21], where a warning is issued in response to virus epidemics during its outbreak. The mechanism of virus elimination from a computer has been considered to be dependent on all of its neighbors. The KS is released by those infected computers to the rest of computers in the network; once successfully receiving the KS, an infected computer may immediately get cured and try to send a KS to its neighbors. The susceptible computer also receives immunization from the KS that contain the antidote programs.
Despite the progress in the KS warning mechanism, focus has been on the concept and numerical simulations on the infected nodes. There is almost no attention to its overall theoretical analysis. It is necessary to study the impact of KS mechanism on the global transmission dynamics of a virus spread. The modeling of the mechanism is very important to describe virus propagation and therefore the qualitative analysis is a most relevant concern in studying the feasibility of the model. The theoretical fundamentals of such a model are the epidemic threshold, existence, and local and global stabilities of the virus-free and virus equilibria.
Based on discussion in preceding section, this paper presents formulation and theoretical analysis of a new model, and provides an assessment of virus prevalence under the effect of the KS warning mechanism. The major contributions of this paper are as follows:


(1)A new SEIR-KS model is formulated and its comprehensive dynamic property is theoretically analyzed.(2)The epidemic threshold is obtained and the existence and uniqueness of the virus equilibrium are discussed.(3)It is established that the virus-free equilibrium and virus equilibrium are locally and globally asymptotically stable by applying Routh–Hurwitz criterion and Lyapunov functional approach.
