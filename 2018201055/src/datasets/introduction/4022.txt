From ‘foundations’ to ‘new paradigms’ is a wide canvas and this paper attempts to paint a picture of human–computer interaction from its earliest roots to future challenges. It is also iconic in that HCI as an academic discipline has always been positioned, sometimes uneasily, sometimes creatively, in the tension between solid intellectual rigour and the excitement in new technology. Stefano Levialdi, of whom this special issue is in honour, had a rich appreciation of both and so I hope this paper is one that he would have enjoyed as well as offering an overview of the field as it was, as it is and as it could be.
