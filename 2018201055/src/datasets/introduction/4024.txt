Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disturbance encountered in clinical practice, diagnosed when the level of serum sodium is abnormally low, typically less than 135 mmol/L. Hyponatremia has been reported to affect between 19–30% of patients admitted to hospital [1], [2] while more than 7% of ambulatory population with age above 55 years would also be affected [3]. It is marker of poor prognosis of the underlying disease, and its occurrence in hospitalized patients is usually associated with a higher mortality rate either during admission or after discharge [3]. Furthermore, patients developing acute hyponatremia (<48 h) are at risk for cerebral edema, tonic-clonic seizures, transtentorial herniation and death [4]. In this setting, selecting the appropriate treatment of hyponatremia is mandatory to prevent the poor prognosis associated with this disorder.
Electrolyte balance has been identified in some survey studies as the most challenging subject for medical students [5] and physicians-in-training. Furthermore, clinical management in hyponatremia is not considered easy by health professionals, with difficulties in classification, diagnosis and management. Unfortunately, there is a low level of agreement when comparing existing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and expert consensus documents (ECDs) [6]. Up to ten different text sources exist for hyponatremia diagnosis and treatment according to a recent review [7]. Agreement between the main reference guidelines seems to be higher on the classification and diagnosis of hyponatremia than on the treatment later applied.
Motivated by the challenge constituted by training unexperienced physicians in the diagnosis of hyponatremia, and with the aim to improve the performance and reduce the errors they commit as compared to hyponatremia experts [8], we developed a computer-interpretable guideline model (CIG) [9], [10], [27] of one of the existing ECDs [11], as recommended by experts of the Endocrinology service department in our healthcare institution, the University Hospital Clínico San Carlos, Madrid. This CIG can be executed as a web page to obtain an argument-based recommendation for diagnosis.
A CIG model as the one described, properly validated, would allow:
•Reinforcement of the active learning of the main concepts regarding the etiology of hyponatremia.•Double-checking the actual knowledge about hyponatremia, correcting misconceptions and learning new key aspects that are included in the guideline knowledge, extended with expert knowledge.
Our system is not devised to determine the diagnosis for real patients (as in-vitro diagnostics would). In its current phase, our aim is to use the CDSS as a training tool. The CIG provides a number of arguments for and against each classification and diagnosis, but the physician always decides which diagnosis is appropriate, regardless of CIG suggestions. Ideally, tutors with expertise in hyponatremia can use the system as a simulation-based learning platform and analyze the output recommendations for selected patient cases together with the physicians-in-training. Therefore, the tool will have both an informative dimension -rather than a probabilistic one- and will provide the chance for experts to detect model or system failures or disagreements with the tool that can eventually be taken into account for future versions of the CIG.
The structure for the rest of the paper follows the STARE-HI guidelines for health informatics evaluation studies [12], also including a section for related work.
1.1. Objectives and study contextThe aim of the present study is to describe and analyze the development of a knowledge-based CDSS training tool for the diagnosis of hyponatremia. The evaluation of the CDSS and the underlying knowledge was carried out using a retrospective dataset, with data collected using a paper form designed ad-hoc for the study (see Appendix A, multimedia component 2, in Supplementary material). This paper describes the methodology used and presents the results of the evaluation and performance of the system for a selected patient data set. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Clinical Research of our Hospital, under application number 15/506-E_BS.The study was developed as a collaboration between the Endocrinology, Metabolism and Nutrition Department and the Innovation Unit of the Hospital Clínico San Carlos, a 960-bed tertiary referral university hospital located in Madrid, Spain. The model presented was designed by a knowledge engineer familiar with CIG languages and a preventive medicine and public health specialist familiar with CPGs and clinical research methodology, both of whom were working in the Innovation Unit. The Endocrinology department provided the expertise in hyponatremia, the case studies, and initial evaluation of the tool. Readers can watch how the system works at the openclinical.net platform [13], [14], where several fragments of guidelines are available for demonstration purposes, and in the video capture available in appendix A (multimedia component 1) in supplementary material.1 The system has been designed to be of use to a wide range of specialties, including internal medicine, endocrinology, nephrology, geriatrics, oncology, emergency department and general practitioners.
1.2. Related workElectrolyte balance has been addressed by authors in artificial intelligence (AI) medical research several times in the past. The first studies were done in the seventies [15], starting with the seminal paper of Bleich et al. [16], in the eighties [17], [18], [19], [20], following the work of Patil and Szolovits [21], and in the nineties [22], [23]. These systems were designed to address identification of electrolyte balance disorders in general. Recently some others have addressed acid-base disorders using fuzzy-based expert systems [24]. As far as we know, only one recent reference paper exists, by Davids et al. [25], that address hyponatremia in particular. Authors developed a multimedia gamification online system for training physicians upon identification of any danger to the patient. The system indicates what “appropriate response” should be established as treatment. They set up two case-based tutorials to help the user understand the underlying physiological changes. Appropriate text messages are displayed, and changes in body compartment sizes, brain size, and plasma sodium concentrations are illustrated via animations. As opposed to the approach of Davids et al. [25], directed towards supporting the management of a diagnosed condition, our system is focused on prior fine-grained sub-classification of the diagnosis, based on a clinical practice guideline. This approach is essential in the field of hyponatremia, given that diagnostic errors are frequent [26]. In fact, a correct classification and diagnosis of this common electrolyte disorder is essential to avoid potentially harmful therapeutic mistakes.Several clinical decision-support systems have been recently built up on top of CIG models [8], [9]. We are aware of two clinically-validated implementations using PROForma language (that we used as technological support for our model), in both breast cancer and lymphoblastic leukemia [28], [29], [30]. The potential of CIGs has been demonstrated in the MobiGuide European project [31], [32], [33], a ubiquitous, distributed and personalized clinical decision-support system (CDSS) used by patients and their care providers through web and smartphones apps in two different domains: gestational diabetes and atrial fibrillation. The MobiGuide DSS applies CIGs to provide real-time patient-specific and personalized recommendations by linking the system with a personal health record (PHR) [34], [35]. Like MobiGuide, other recent experiences by Shalom et al. [36] has shown the potential to increase compliance using such systems.
