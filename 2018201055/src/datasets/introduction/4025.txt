The convenience and popularization of the Internet have brought huge benefits to human society. Meanwhile, it offers a shortcut to spread computer viruses, inflicting large economic losses  [1]. Consequently, the problem of how to effectively suppress digital viruses has long been a hot spot in the field of network security research. The epidemic modeling of computer infections is recognized as a feasible approach to the assessment of prevalence of electronic viruses as well as that of effectiveness of different virus-containing strategies  [2]. Since the seminal work by Kephart and White  [3], [4], multifarious computer virus spreading models, ranging from the coarsest population-level models  [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and the intermediate network-level models  [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] to the finest node-level epidemic models, have been proposed  [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].
Disruptive computer virusese are defined as those whose life period consists of two consecutive phases: the latent phase and the disruptive phase. In the latent phase, a disruptive virus staying in a host does not perform any disruptive operations. Rather, the virus tries to infect as many hosts as possible by sending its copies to them. In the disruptive phase, a disruptive virus staying in a host performs a variety of operations that disrupt the host, such as distorting data, deleting data or files, and destroying the operating system. For example, the notorious Melissa virus propagates by means of emails, paralyzing the email server. As the second instance, the CIH virus propagates through the Internet and emails, destroying the BIOS of all infected hosts on some prescribed dates. To assess the prevalence of disruptive viruses, a number of epidemic models, which are referred to as the Susceptible–Latent–Bursting–Susceptible (SLBS) models, have been suggested  [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], which have been extended towards different directions  [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]. Recently, Yang et al.  [35] established a node-level SLBS model, where all nodes have the same infecting rate, the same curing rate, and the same disruptive rate. In real-world applications, different nodes may enjoy different attributes and different safety levels. Therefore, they may have different infecting rates, different curing rates, and different bursting rates. In such scenarios, heterogeneous SLBS models may be more appropriate.
This paper addresses the issue of assessing the prevalence of disruptive computer viruses in the situation that every node in a network has its own virus-related attributes. For that purpose, a heterogeneous epidemic model is proposed. A criterion for the global stability of the virus-free equilibrium and a criterion for the existence of a unique viral equilibrium are given, respectively. Furthermore, extensive simulation experiments are conducted, and some interesting results are drawn from the experimental results. On this basis, some measures of suppressing disruptive malware are recommended.
The remaining materials of this work are organized in the following pattern. Section  2 formulates the new epidemic model. Section  3 theoretically studies this model, and Section  4 conducts extensive simulation experiments. This work is closed by Section  5.
