With the development of digital image processing technologies, CG is more and more photorealistic. As it provides conveniences to our daily life, it also brings serious consequence to the society if the high realistic CG is used in the occasions such as journalism, scientific research and justice. Therefore, digital image forensics is becoming a research hotspot in authenticating digital image’s authenticity, primitiveness and integrity [1], [2], [3], [4]. As an important branch of digital image forensics, discrimination of NI and CG has attracted many researchers’ attention in the past decade.
Since NI and CG are generated from different image acquisition pipelines, there should exist some significant differences between them. Although many previous works have been put effort on this topic from different viewpoints, the identification performance is still far from satisfactory.
Here, residual images of NI and CG are analyzed in detail and the texture difference of them is studied. Moreover, the differences between the fitting degree of the regression model of NI and CG are investigated. Based on these differences, features are extracted and SVM classifier is used to discriminate NI and CG.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the related works are introduced in Section 2; the feature extraction is investigated in Section 3; the discrimination scheme is described in Section 4; the experimental results and analysis are provided in Section 5; finally, some conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
