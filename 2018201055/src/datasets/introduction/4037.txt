Persons who have lost sight disability are called as visually impaired individual. These people often need other people's help because they do not have a sense of sight. Some products have been developed in the hardware and software fields so that these people who need special care can continue their lives. These products; cane, talking clock, kitchen scales, screen reading programs, recorders, Braille printers, etc. The common feature of these products is that they transfer to visually impaired individuals by voice and use them with Braille alphabet. The Braille alphabet is an alphabet that is developed for visually impaired individuals.
The Braille alphabet was developed in 1829 by Louis Braille. The Braille characters are represented with 6 dots in total while they consist of 2 columns and 3 rows. Current commercially available Braille displays use 8 dots instead of 6 dots to perform cursor functions. The Braille alphabet contains a total of 64 characters. When the PC became widely used, a refreshable Braille display was needed, and the answer is by using actuators to control the convex or flatness of Braille dots [1]. A Braille display comprises both mechanical and electronic parts for displaying a line of Braille codes [2].
Actuators are usually utilized in order to enable each Braille cell to write different characters. Apart from actuators, several electronic circuit elements can also be used. Some of those include; polymer actuator [3], [4], elastomer actuator [3], [5], piezoelectric actuator [3], [6], flapper actuator [2], [3], micro bobin actuator [3], [7], bistable electroactive polymers [3], [8], [9], pneumatic balloon actuators [3], [10], field-effect transistor and polymeric actuators [3], [11], relay [3], [12], [13], electro-mechanically [14] etc.
With advancements in computer technology, new applications featuring human-computer interaction are being developed [15]. In this study, a document reader which comprises 96 Braille cells and has various functional features for the visually impaired people has been developed. The visually impaired person can read the document at that moment with this device. Characters obtained from Optic Character Recognition (OCR) algorithms after any document is scanned or characters derived from any document stored in a computer are transmitted to the Braille cells, enabling a visually impaired person to read by using his hands. The device's Braille display section consists of 2 rows, each containing 48 Braille cells. The device also enables visually impaired people to listen to any text sent from a computer through USB or Bluetooth.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, operating logic of Braille cells and panels are explained. Our proposed method and developed electronic circuits are described with details in Section 3. Finally, we discuss the results in Section 4.
