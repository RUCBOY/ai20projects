Physician-patient communication remains the cornerstone in the physician-patient relationship [1], [2], [3], [4]. Good physician communication leads to more detailed histories, better adherence of patients with physicians’ advice and treatment plan; and better clinical outcomes of chronic diseases [3]. With the rise in the use of electronic medical records (EMR), a new member, the computer, has been added to this relationship and concerns were raised about its impact on the physician-patient communication.
The current literature still poses a debate about the impact of the computer use on physician-patient communication. Some debate that computer use leads to over-reliance on electronic resources, deterioration of the relationship[5],and a certain disengagement of the physician from the patient centered interview leading to a less productive interview and worse outcomes [6]. In the past decade, 3 systematic reviews have been published [7], [8], [9]. Conclusions of the systematic reviews are: (1) an overall high satisfaction of patients with physicians’ use of computers is reported; (2) the detailed analysis suggests both negative and positive effects on different aspects of the patient-doctor communication. The use of the computers enhances patient engagement and information sharing; on the other hand, it leads to less emotional talk and patient rapport. (3) The data collection method was through videotaped/observed encounters and post-visit satisfaction questionnaires. The majority of the studies addressed the physician’s perspective and only few explored the patient’s perspective.
Patient experience, perspective and satisfaction is of utmost importance for healthcare delivery. [10]Measurement of patient experience provides the opportunity to develop strategic quality improvement initiatives to improve the care and effectively manage healthcare performance [11]. Measuring patient experience can be done using mixed methods, quantitative or qualitative approaches. Although qualitative approach would evaluate better the reality of the patient experience and give patient a voice to improve the care, it is not suitable for comparisons [11]. On the other hand, quantitative approach allows for larger sample size and more testing of associations and comparisons [11]. Sitzia and Wood [10] found that cross sectional sample and self-reported questionnaires were mostly used in published articles that assessed patient satisfaction.
There exist certain concerns about the measurement of patient experience [11] especially when measured immediately post the doctor visit in the clinic [12]. In-visit surveys allow more accurate recall of the experience especially when dealing with communication skills relevant to the encounter as compared to experience with the clinic processes (such as access to clinic, waiting time, etc). On the other hand, patients might be reluctant to give their physicians low ratings despite the anonymity. Wongus et al. [12] have shown that there is no difference between the mean score of patient satisfaction between within-the-visit survey and 30 day post visit mail survey. In another study, the presence of unmet expectations and decreased satisfaction was highest immediately post visit as compared to 2-week and 3 months post visit especially in the domain of patient-doctor communication [13].
Therefore, this study aims to assess the patients’ perspective of the effect of the physician’s computer use during the clinical encounter on the interpersonal and communication skills of the physicians using a validated communication assessment tool (CAT) [14]. Percentage of time physicians use the EMR during the encounter (typing and gazing) was found to vary between one physician and another from 24.9% to 49.6% of the visit [15]. Therefore we will compare the patient perspective of the physicians’ communication skills across four categories of computer use by physicians (no use, little amount, moderate amount and a great deal).
