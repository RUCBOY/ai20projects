The advent of computers has brought tremendous changes to our daily life as well as the way businesses are conducted. Computer skills represent an increasingly important component of human capital that is required by today's workplaces (Benbasat et al., 1980, Levina and Xin, 2007). In literature, researchers have shown that computer skills can improve worker productivity (Hitt & Brynjolfsson, 1996), create new businesses (Fairlie, 2006), and afford wage premium to employees (DiMaggio & Bonikowski, 2008). However, few studies have examined how computer skills might affect worker employment.
Examining the impact of computer skills on employment is of great theoretical and practical importance. Employability is a critical factor in attracting employees to develop necessary skills, particularly computer skills, which are increasingly required by the modern work practices (Levina and Xin, 2007, Waterman et al., 1994). Potential computer skill-biased employability could motivate employees to acquire these skills, thus influencing employees' decisions to develop related human capital. Consequently, investigating the potential impact of computer skills on employability would affect education, training, and career development of individuals, and would have profound implications for educational policies, future supply of a qualified workforce, and, even for the overall competitiveness of a nation. In this study, we draw upon theories of human capital and social capital to derive and test hypotheses relating employee computer skills to worker employment. We make use of data from the 2003 Computer Use Supplement Survey and 2004 Displaced Worker Survey from the US Current Population Surveys (CPS) to test the hypotheses. Our results not only shed light on how computer skills have affected worker employment but also contribute to the broader issue of how information technologies (IT) has changed the lives of individuals in this increasingly computerized society.
