It is reported in the Cisco Visual Networking Index [1] that smartphone traffic will exceed PC-oriented traffic by 2021. On the other hand, the number of machine-to-machine connections is expected to reach 14.6 billion by 2022 due to proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT), smart city applications and cyber physical systems. Wireless heterogeneous networks (HetNets), integrated with cloud computing [2], are serving as an enabling technology to cater for the growing demands in both communications and computations. However, cloud servers are usually far away from mobile devices and can cause tremendous transmission delays during computation offloading. This can harm the quality of service (QoS) of mobile users since intensive user tasks like deep neural networks (DNNs) on mobile devices require quick responses. Meanwhile, the battery power may drift fast due to long communication distance from device to cloud.
Multiple-access edge computing (MEC) serves as a complement for cloud computing can overcome those limitations with edge servers deployed at base stations (BSs), access points (APs) and IoT gateways [3]. Take DNN inference as an example. The data sampled by industrial internet of things devices can be used for DNN inference. With edge–cloud cooperation, the inference service delay can be reduced [4]. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning, the UAV edge base station can assist the computation of deep learning tasks from UAVs for path planning based on the obtained UAVs’ sensing data [5]. Both in [4], [5] and many other studies, the training or inferring tasks are modeled by arrival bits per time slot, thus it is also adopted by this work.
