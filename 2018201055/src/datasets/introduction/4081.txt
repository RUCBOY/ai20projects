In patients with early-stage breast cancer, the presence or absence of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis is the most important prognostic factor used in adjuvant therapy decision making [1]. The 5-year survival for patients with node-negative disease is 82.8% compared with 73% for 1–3 positive nodes, and 45.7% for 4–12 positive nodes [2]. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) and histologic examination is considered the standard for axillary evaluation of breast cancers.
Ultrasound (US) is widely used for breast cancer screening, diagnosis and preoperative staging [3]. US combined with fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy is an important modality to evaluate the ALN metastasis, however, the sonographic criteria for determining malignancy in ALN do not present significant predictive values and the accuracy of fine-needle aspiration or core needle biopsy depends on the operators’ experience and skill [4]. In addition to various imaging modalities [5], [6], several nomograms and computer-aided prediction (CAP) systems by use of primary tumor characteristics such as tumor size, tumor type and grade, lymphovascular invasion, and hormonal status have been developed to predict ALN status in breast cancer [7], [8], [9]. However, the performance was not high and need further development.
Computer-aided diagnosis system based on tumor morphology and textural features in US images have been successfully used to detect and diagnosis of breast cancer [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the CAP systems of ALN status using the tumor surrounding tissue features in US images have not been reported. We hypothesized that breast tumor surrounding tissue features in US images might be useful to develop the CAP systems and to predict ALN status in breast cancer.
The purpose of this study is to develop a CAP system to determine the ALN status in breast cancer using the tumor surrounding tissue features in US images.
