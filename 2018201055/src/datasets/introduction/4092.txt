Each year, an estimated 300,000 maternal and six million under-five deaths occur globally [1], [2]. Though these rates are an improvement from two decades ago, maternal and child mortality remains a challenge, and few low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) successfully achieved the reduction targets of both Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 [3].
Measurement of progress towards maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH) goals is difficult [4]. National-level MNCH data in LMIC are commonly collected using comprehensive household coverage surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) [5] or Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) [6]. However, coverage survey data collection processes are complex and lengthy [7]. Survey implementation, quality assurance, and data management are especially challenged by weak infrastructure such as poor roads and inconsistent electricity, as well as limited resources, funds, and trained personnel. Costs and time for questionnaire printing, collation, quality checks, data entry, and analysis are limiting factors [8], [9], [10].
Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) involves interviewer-administered digital questionnaires using a computerized device and has been proposed and tried as an alternative to overcome the challenges associated with traditional paper-and-pencil interviewing (PAPI). CAPI is increasingly being implemented in LMIC settings, such as for district-level maternal and neonatal health evaluations in Burkina Faso [11], Tanzania, Uganda [12], and Malawi [13], and for national-level DHS data collection in Nepal [14]. When compared to PAPI, the technical advantages of CAPI include improved data quality [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], lower long-term costs [13], [15], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], and time-efficiency (e.g. direct export of collected data into an electronic database) [20], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].
However, shifting from PAPI to CAPI in LMIC involves potential obstacles. While some papers have documented acceptance of electronic data collection among local health professionals and data collectors based on post-survey feedback [8], [16], [19], [23], [27], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], acceptance among survey respondents and community members has been variable. Anecdotal experiences documented from Costa Rica [8], Tanzania [27], [32], Nepal [14], Sri Lanka [30], and Fiji [16] expressed positive CAPI uptake by survey respondents, citing local intrigue for CAPI devices and the perception of professionalism associated with CAPI. Suspicion towards CAPI has been reported from South Africa [34] and Angola [36], especially related to concerns of being secretly recorded by the cameras on CAPI devices. In Ethiopia, significantly more refusals in CAPI versus PAPI cohorts were noted [10]. In Kenya, devices used for ‘audio computer-assisted self-interviewing’ were reportedly associated with devil worship by community members [37].
The Healthy Child Uganda (HCU) partnership within the Maternal, Newborn and Child Health Institute at Mbarara University of Science and Technology in Uganda frequently collects coverage-type data among women and households for evaluation and research purposes. Understanding respondent perceptions are important in helping to determine the appropriateness and best practice methods of shifting from PAPI to CAPI for MNCH-coverage surveys. To date, no published studies have prospectively explored acceptability of CAPI for MNCH-specific surveys among Ugandan or female survey respondents, nor evaluated the factors influencing CAPI acceptability. This study assessed the acceptability of CAPI and its influencing factors to inform MNCH data collection in rural Southwest Uganda.
