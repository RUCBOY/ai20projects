The wide band-gap delafossite-type ABO2 compounds, where A = Cu, Ag…, and B = Al, Ga, In, Y..., crystallize in two polytypes structures: hexagonal 2H (space group: P63/mmc) and rhombohedral 3R (space group: R3‾m) crystal structures [[1], [2], [3]]. Delafossites with the general chemical formula ABO2 belong to a particular group of solids characterized by sheets of linearly coordinated A cations stacked within the edge-shared octahedral layers of BO6. Delafossite materials are a new family of transparent conducting oxides having remarkable optoelectronic properties [4,5]. The delafossite materials, especially the copper and silver-based ones, are of particular interest due to their bandgap values that are suitable for various optical devices [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. One of the unique features of this family of compounds is that it can be combined with p-type and n-type semiconductor materials to shape up pn-junctions that can be used for electricity generation as inner layers in solar cells. Because of this unique feature, these materials are acknowledged as a reference in visible-spectrum optoelectronics and with this, a new area of research has been emerged in solar cell technologies [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Dietrich & Jansen [14] reported the synthesis of the AgScO2 in the 3R structure. Shannon et al. reported the synthesis and structural parameters of some 3R structured delafossite compounds [2]. Later on, Kandpal et al. [15] reported the influence of the d10-d10 interaction in some 3R structured delafossite compounds. They also predicted their suitability as transparent conducting oxides. Nagarajan et al. [16] reported the synthesis and conductivities of a series of delafossite compounds. They predicted that the Ag-based delafossite compounds have lower conductivities than the copper-based ones. Sheets et al. [4] experimentally predicted that the optical band gap of AgScO2 is 3.8 eV which is larger than the fundamental band gap of 2.4 eV obtained by the same authors using the “linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO)" method. Using a minimum jump method coupled with high-throughput computations, Cerqueira et al. [17] reported that the bandgap of AgScO2 is equal to 2.1 eV which is significantly lower than the predicted value by Sheets et al. [4]; 3.8 eV. Such an ongoing debate on the electronic and optical properties of delafossite compounds [18,19] encouraged us to perform a detailed study on the physical properties of some delafossite materials. Although the Ag-based delafossites are potential candidates for p-type transparent conducting oxides (TCO) and have interesting electronic and optical properties, they drew less attention than the copper-based delafossites. This may be due to their difficult synthesis chemistry [19].
To our knowledge, information on the physical properties of the 2H–AgInO2 and 2H–AgYO2 compounds are scarce. This motivates us to explore their structural, electronic, thermoelectric, thermodynamic as well as the optical properties of their thin films via FP-LAPW method as implemented in the WIEN2k code [20,21]. Besides, we checked their dynamical stability by calculating the phonon dispersion curves.
The organization of the paper is as follows: We briefly explain the method of calculations in Sec. 2. In Sec. 3, we present, analyze, and discuss our obtained results concerning the studied properties. Finally, our findings and conclusions are summarized in the last section (Sec. 4).
