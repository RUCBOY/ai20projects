Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious endocrine disorder characterized by chronic high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) caused by deficiency in the secretion of insulin, or ineffective use of insulin by the body [1]. In general, insulin is produced by beta cells of the pancreas to maintain normal blood glucose level in the body. The characteristic symptoms of DM are weight loss, blurred vision, dehydration and frequent urination. Prolonged uncontrolled DM may lead to specific complications such as nephropathy leading to kidney failure, retinopathy resulting in blindness, and neuropathy with increased risk of ulceration, Charcot foot development and amputation [1]. These complications may affect the quality of life, cause disability and even early death.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 3.7 million deaths were reported in 2012 due to high blood glucose levels [2]. In this, 1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes and remaining 2.2 million deaths were due to heart diseases, renal disease and tuberculosis in relation to high blood glucose. Further, the majority of these deaths (43%) happen prior to the age of 70, which are considered as premature and accounting for 1.6 million global deaths [2]. In any case, diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are among the most common foot complication that critically affect about 15% of the diabetic population [3]. Moreover, diabetic patients are 12%–25% more likely to develop foot ulcers in their lifetime [4], [5] with nearly 85% of the lower limb amputations due to non-healing and infected foot ulcers [6]. The risk factors leading to the development of foot ulcers are primarily neuropathy and arterial disease in the lower limb [7]. It is approximated that 50% of the diabetes patients with foot ulcer will have neuropathy, nearly 20% of them will have lack of arterial blood perfusion as illustrated in Fig. 1, and almost 80% of them will have both conditions [8], [9].Download : Download high-res image (619KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Illustrations of blood circulation in normal and diabetic foot.
The diabetic foot wounds often develop in patient who at least have two risk factors simultaneously, with peripheral neuropathy as the major one [10]. Nearly 66% of the diabetic patients are at risk of developing peripheral neuropathy [11]. Because of this neuropathy, the foot sensation is impaired and may leads to foot deformity which causes gait abnormalities [10]. For diabetic patients with neuropathy, foot ulcerations may develop due to a minor wound. This minor wound can be caused by bruise, blister, improper footwear or even barefoot walking. Equally important, the foot may also experience unnatural biomechanical loading as result of insensitive and deformed foot, and limited joint movement. This yields large pressure on certain regions which in turn results in the formation of callus (dense skin) [10]. Generally, the further increase in loading results in bleeding into the skin and ultimately ulcerations. Consequently, the wound healing process on the insensitive foot will be impaired if patients continue to walk.
Typically, diabetic patients will have their feet screen at least once annually to determine patients with at risk foot and to search for signs of peripheral arterial disease or peripheral neuropathy. Minimally, the examination and inspection of the feet comprised of foot and medical history examination and, neuropathy assessment [10]. The foot and medical history examinations includes health conditions of the vascular, skin, bone and joint, and the previous history of ulceration or amputation [10]. For neuropathy assessment, the following methods are being conducted: enquiring on pain or tingling symptoms in the lower extremities; pressure perception using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments; vibration perception using 128 Hz tuning fork; discrimination using pin prick on dorsum of foot superficial; tactile sensation using cotton wool or by lightly touching the toes tips with index fingers; and assessing the Achilles tendon reflexes [10].
The advancement in infrared (IR) camera technology, in terms of resolution and response time, has transformed the field of measuring temperature and is now being extensively used for medical purposes [12]. The IR techniques allow rapid capturing of large number of pixels, or picture elements [13]. The individual pixels at the respective points denote the temperature. Collectively, these pixels create an image illustrating the surface temperature distribution. Essentially, temperature changes are linked to certain diseases detected by viewing the temperature distribution on the body using IR thermography. The IR thermography has been employed in various medical studies, namely vascular disorders [14], [15], [16], [17], rheumatoid arthritis [18], breast cancer [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], muscular pain [24], [25] and dry eye [26], [27]. Also, infrared thermography has been widely used for diabetes detection such as to analyze body temperature variations [28] and metabolic parameters [29], estimate blood glucose [30], detect temperature variations in hypoglycemia [31], and compare infrared thermography with biochemical assay methods [32]. Also, IR thermography is used in many diabetic foot studies as tabulated in Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4. These diabetic foot studies are based on the temperature distribution of the plantar foot that rely on blood perfusion. In conditions, when blood circulation is significantly reduced (ischemic), especially at the peripheral limbs, the temperature pattern will change [33].Table 1.
