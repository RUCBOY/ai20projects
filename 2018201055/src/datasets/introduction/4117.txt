Studies of human-computer interaction have focused on the development, implementation, and performance evaluation of interactive computing systems and software designed for human use [1]. Human-computer interaction is widely considered an integral component of many education and training systems at various levels of technology access [2]. Of the many education and training systems developed in recent years, one of the most intensively studied is interactive computer game-based learning systems, which have been developed and applied in many teaching-learning activities, especially for children and adolescent learners [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] because children in these age groups are intrinsically motivated to play games and often lack interest or motivation in their courses [4].
Studies agree that various approaches to gamification-in-learning are more effective for increasing knowledge absorption and cognitive development compared to traditional learning approaches (non-gamification in learning) [4], [8]. Issues related to computer game-based learning systems and their applications have attracted interest in many fields of education technology [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [9]. In the literature on antecedents and consequences of education technology adoption and use by learners, one important stream of research that has emerged in the past decade is learner acceptance of computer-based learning systems. Studies show that the key factors in user acceptance of these systems are perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, and satisfaction [2], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. Studies of these factors have improved understanding of learner behavior and understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the use of computer-based learning systems.
Although these studies have improved understanding of learner acceptance of education technologies, they do not adequately explain how perceived interactivity of an education technology affects the use behaviors and perceptions of learners. This question is important because interactivity affects learning efficiency in both the traditional classroom and computer-based learning systems [15].
The technology acceptance model (TAM) introduced by Davis [16], [17] has been validated as reliable for predicting the acceptance or adoption of new technologies by end-users [18], [19], [20], [21]. The six components of the technology acceptance model (TAM) [16], [17] are external variables, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude toward use, behavioral intention to use, and actual use. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are the two main determinants of whether an individual adopts a new technology [2], [19], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Asan and colleagues [26] reported that the behaviors of technology users depend on their familiarity with the technology; moreover, their use of the technology tends to increase when they perceive that the technology is effective and easy to use for achieving their goals. Hence, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use were the mediating variables in the technology acceptance analysis in the current study.
Both variables have been widely used in studies of educational technology, and their validity is well established [2], [12]. The target technology in the current study was a computer game-based learning system. According to Hackbarth et al. [28], the perceived playfulness of an interactive game-based system is a system-specific characteristic. That is, a learner may perceive different levels of playfulness in different computer game-based learning systems [19]. Thus, we extended the TAM model by including a variable for perceived playfulness. Based on previous studies of human-computer interaction, the proposed research model considered how the use of the proposed computer game-based learning system was affected by both human-related factors (i.e., perceived interactivity) and by computer-related factors (i.e., perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived playfulness).
Another important measure of the value of a technology system is user satisfaction [2]. Learners with high satisfaction are also likely to continue using the system [30]. Based on the above concepts, this study integrated perceived interactivity in an extended TAM model (i.e., integrating perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived playfulness) used to investigate antecedents of learner satisfaction and continued use of a learning system. The objective was to improve understanding of the determinants of continued use of an interactive computer game-based visual perception learning system by learners after their initial adoption of the system.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have integrated perceived interactivity in an extended model of TAM to investigate learner satisfaction with an interactive computer game-based learning system and continued use of the system. Thus, the objective of this study was to fill this gap in the literature. Specifically, this study had three aims. The first aim was to examine how the extended TAM (perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and perceived playfulness) is affected by the perceived interactivity. The second aim was to examine how users’ satisfaction with the system is affected by the extended TAM. The third aim was to examine how continued use of the learning system is affected by users’ satisfaction with the system.
