Breast ultrasound (US), a popular adjunct to mammography, has been used to examine women with dense breasts for cancer diagnosis [1], [2]. Compared with mammography, US has the advantages of being radiation-free and well tolerated by patients [3], [4]. For distinguishing between malignant and benign breast lesions, Stavros et al. [5] proposed several US characteristics, including shape, orientation, margins, lesion boundary, echo pattern, and posterior acoustic features, in the descriptions of breast masses. These US characteristics are also quantified in many computer-aided classification systems for automatic breast cancer detection [6], [7], [8].
The American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6666 trial showed that the combination of US and mammography resulted in a significant improvement in cancer detection from 7.6 to 11.8 per thousand patients [9]. Moreover, the 70% of lesions and nearly 82% of cancers detected by US alone with normal mammography and physical examination in women with dense breasts were 1 cm or smaller [10]. Although US screening is useful in detecting breast tumors, radiologists are burdened with large US screening populations and may overlook potential abnormalities in the US review. More nonpalpable cancers occulted on mammograms might be recognized with the improvement of US techniques [10].
Recently, several computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) approaches have been developed and surveyed for automatically detecting and classifying breast cancer in US imaging [6]. However, features such as echogenicity work well for recognizing large tumors, but not small tumors [6]. In the present study, adaptive filtering was introduced into a CAD system to emphasize the meaningfulness of tumor size; moreover, a novel regularization technique for CAD, named the adaptive CAD (A-CAD) system, was proposed for improving the performance of screening US image classification. The A-CAD system used various quantitative US characteristics to provide consistent and objective suggestions to radiologists in interpreting US screening images. Unlike the conventional CAD system, the composite prediction model in A-CAD was constructed from all quantitative features based on two different tumor size groups (<1 cm and ⩾1 cm) to highlight the characteristics of the breast tumors detected in screening ultrasound.
