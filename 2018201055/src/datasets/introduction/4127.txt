The image reconstruction is a mathematical method that joins projections of an imaging modality and transfers them into a computed digital image. Image reconstruction problems necessitate complex computations, and generally require various approaches for different imaging modality. As a typical inverse problem, tomography image reconstruction is usually considered as an ill-posed problem [1]. The difficulty of reconstructing images from projection data happens in a different kind of medical imaging modalities specifically in computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at blood vessels in your brain, neck, heart, lungs, kidneys and legs. MR spectroscopy (MRS) is a modality that is available on most state-of-the-art clinical MR scanners. For the brain in particular, MRS has been a powerful research tool and has also been proven to provide additional clinically relevant information for several disease families such as brain tumors, metabolic disorders, and systemic diseases. MRS is restricted to the analysis of individual regions of interest (ROI) much larger than the resolution of MRI. [2], positron emission tomography (PET) [3], single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) [4], electron magnetic resonance (EMR) tomography [5], electron microscopy, radio astronomy, and seismic imaging.
The tomography image reconstruction [6] of an image is formed of deciding an image object f (x, y) from a collection of projections (Radon transform) pθ(r) given by Eq. (1).(1)pθ(r)=∫−∞∞∫−∞∞f(x,y)δ(r−xcosθ−ysinθ)dxdy.where r is taken on the x–y plane such that r = xcosθ−ysinθ. The discrete inverse radon transform is carried out with the Filtered Back Projection (FBP) algorithm. FBP is established on the basis of Fourier Slice theorem [1]. The excellence of reconstruction from entire projections with FBP is widely acceptable, based on the number of angles and sampling points.
The projections pθ(r), accumulated along a group of static field-gradient orientations in polar grid, are utilized to acquire the sample spin density f (x, y) by Eq. (2) FBP,(2)f(x,y)∫0πpθ∗(r)dθ=∫0π[∫−∞∞Pθ(k)|k|e−2πikrdk]dθ,here pθ∗(r) is the projection Pθ(k) filtered by the expression inside the square brackets.
Few important reconstruction methods such as convolution [7] and FBP [8] are convincingly effective and fast, but their quality are low when the projection data are noisy and limited [9]. An Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) [10], Multiplicative ART [11], [12], Simultaneous ART [13] are shows better resolution for in vivo imaging in real time [9]. However, these techniques suffer with enormous computational complexity [14], that is corresponding to the square of the image size multiplied by the number of projections [10].
In the framework of soft computing strategies to image reconstruction from projections, artificial neural networks have been utilized as a very popular and important tool [15]. In an earlier study recurrent neural network algorithm has been utilized for image reconstruction [16], fast tomography reconstruction from limited data has been reported using ANN [17] and the reconstruction technique using BP-ANN has been implemented on a sequential computer [9], which require ANN very long training time.
The parallel approach to ANN has been explored in a variety of manner, specifically, training session parallelism, exemplar parallelism, node parallelism, and weight parallelism [18]. Parallel approach of BP-ANN has been exposed to be an efficient resolution to all cases of long training times in sequential ANN training on a cluster computer [19], [20], [21], [22]. The training datasets are decomposed into a number of subsets and the subsets are allocated to different computing nodes for parallel processing [23] on a cluster computer [24]. As an extension of the recent work carried out on a sequential computer [9], the present work deals with dataset decomposition principle.
The next section deals with the methodology of the parallel approach of the work. Section 3 discusses the design and implementation details. The results are discussed in Section 4 and concluded in Section 5.
