Traveling salesman problem (TSP) [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6] is a classical problem of combinatorial optimization problems, which can be applied to many fields such as computer science, logistics scheduling and industrial engineering. Because TSP has extensive applications such as transportation, circuit board design and logistics distribution, scholars at home and abroad have done a lot of researches on it. Early researchers used precise algorithms to solve this problem, including branch and bound method, linear programming method, dynamic programming and so on. However, with the increasing of the scale, the precise algorithms will become powerless. Therefore, in the later research, scholars focused on using heuristic algorithms, mainly including genetic algorithm (GA), ant colony algorithm (ACA), and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC). The representative works of TSP are as follows: Durbin and Willshaw [1] published their work in Nature, proposed an analogue approach to TSP based on an elastic net method; Wang et al. [2] applied multi-offspring genetic algorithm to TSP; Ezugwu et al. [3] gave a symbiotic organisms search optimization algorithm for TSP; Choong et al. [4] applied artificial bee colony algorithm using a modified choice function to TSP; Chen and Dai [5] gave a survy of the algorithms for TSP, and discussed the future research; Guo [6] introduced the basic knowledge, applications and some solving methods of TSP.
In the given cities and their distances, TSP is to find a Hamiltonian tour where the traveling distance is as small as possible. TSP belongs to NP-complete problems, it can be transformed into lots of variants. More importantly, it provides an ideal platform for studying combinatorial optimization problems. Many combinatorial optimization problems, such as knapsack problem, assignment problem and shop floor scheduling problem, are NP-complete problems with the same difficulty as TSP. If one of them can be solved by polynomial deterministic algorithms, then all other NP-complete problems can also be solved by them. Many methods were originally developed from TSP and its variants, and later extended to other NP-complete problems, thus it is significant to study TSP and its versions problems [6].
Bottleneck traveling salesman problem (BTSP) [7], [8], [9] is a variant of traveling salesman problem, its objective is to make the maximum edge of a Hamiltonian tour as small as possible. Some works for BTSP include: Ahmed [7] used a hybrid genetic algorithm for solving BTSP, the hybrid algorithm incorporated 2-opt search, local search and immigration to the basic genetic algorithm for optimizing the solutions, and the experiments showed the effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm; the literatures [8], [9] studied more details about BTSP. However, some real-world problems with multiple objectives or tasks cannot be modeled by BTSP, thus it is necessary to design new optimization model for modeling this problem.
Based on TSP, multiple traveling salesmen problem (MTSP) [10], [11], [12], [13] was given, it is an extended model of TSP, and can be used to model the optimization problems with multiple tasks, such as printer scheduling problem and task scheduling problem. Some works of MTSP are included: Zhou et al. [10] made a comparative study of improved genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization for MTSP; Kitjacharoenchai et al. [11] discussed the mathematical model and heuristic approach for drones MTSP; Lu and Yue [12] proposed mission-oriented ant-team ant colony optimization for min–max MTSP; Venkatesh and Singh [13] utilized two nature-inspired methods to solve the multiple traveling salespersons problem.
Another well-known variant of TSP named generalized traveling salesman problem (GTSP), as one problem of generalized combinatorial optimization problems, is also studied: Snyder and Daskin [14] proposed a random-key genetic algorithm for GTSP; Gutin and Karapetyan [15] gave a memetic algorithm for GTSP; Ardalan et al. [16] presented a novel imperialist competitive algorithm to solve GTSP; Yuan et al. [17] applied a branch-and-cut algorithm to solve GTSP with time windows; Baniasadi et al. [18] proposed a transformation technique for the clustered GTSP with applications to logistics; Venkatesh et al. [19] used an artificial bee colony algorithm with variable degree of perturbation to solve the generalized covering TSP.
Besides above mentioned studies, other works are as follows: Karaboga and Gorkemli [20] used combinatorial artificial bee colony algorithms for solving traveling salesman problem; Taillard and Helsgaun [21] proposed a low-complexity constructive method for general and large TSP; Osaba et al. [22] applied an improved discrete bat algorithm to solve symmetric and asymmetric traveling salesman problems; Agatz et al. [23] developed several fast route-first, cluster second heuristics based on local search and dynamic programming for TSP with drone; Veenstra et al. [24] proposed a large neighborhood search heuristic and introduced new removal operators for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with handling costs; Ha et al. [25] discussed min-cost traveling salesman problem with drone and gave two algorithms for solving it; Osaba et al. [26] presented a discrete water cycle algorithm for solving the symmetric and asymmetric traveling salesman problem; Taş et al. [27] proposed and compared several mathematical programming formulations for TSP with time-dependent service times.
After MTSP, more complex TSP variants were studied. Because MTSP cannot model multi-machine engineering systems (MES), Li et al. [28] provided colored traveling salesman problem (CTSP) for modeling MES, and used genetic algorithm, greedy genetic algorithm (GAG), climb-hilling genetic algorithm (HCGA) and simulated annealing genetic algorithm (SAGA) to solve CTSP; Dong and Cai [29] proposed a novel genetic algorithm with ITÖ process for large scale colored balanced traveling salesman problem, where the city number is more than 1000; Dong et al. [30] presented a hybrid algorithm based on particle swarm optimization, simulating annealing and genetic algorithm for colored bottleneck traveling salesman problem (CBTSP); Meng et al. [31] proposed a population-based incremental learning algorithm for a serial CTSP; Meng et al. [32] presented a variable neighborhood search for a general CTSP, it is different with the radial CTSP in literature [28]; Dong et al. [33] used the artificial bee colony algorithm with generating neighborhood solution for large scale optimization of the radial CTSP.
In recent years, some studies for large scale optimization are as follows: Yang et al. [34] provided a segment-based predominant learning swarm optimizer for large scale optimization; Wang et al. [35] used semi-definite relaxation and applications to study large-scale binary quadratic optimization; Zhang and Chiang [36] designed a novel consensus-based particle swarm optimization-assisted trust-tech methodology for large scale global optimization; Hu et al. [37] used a fast identification cooperation co-evolution algorithm for large scale optimization.
The current followed trend and developments are also studied in the literatures: Hassanien and Emary [38] discussed the principles, advances and applications of swarm intelligence, and gave a comprehensive description of the latest swarm algorithms such as bat algorithm and firefly algorithm; Del Ser et al. [39] identified open challenges concerning the most relevant areas within bio-inspired optimization, and talked about the most followed current trend and gave an exciting future for bio-inspired computation; Kar [40] discussed the popularly used bio-inspired algorithms, such as genetic algorithm and ant colony optimization, and introduced the principles, developments and scope of application; Dong et al. [41] applied a discrete ITÖ algorithm to solve colored traveling salesman problem; Wang et al. [42] proposed a novel ITÖ algorithm for influence maximization optimization of large scale social networks; Su et al. [43] used hill-climbing genetic algorithm for 2D triangular protein structure prediction; Örkcü [44] gave a hybrid genetic algorithm with simulated annealing for subset selection in multiple linear regression models; Jun and Park [45] proposed a hybrid genetic algorithm for the hybrid flow shop scheduling problem; Sonmez and Bettemir [46] discussed another hybrid genetic algorithm for discrete time–cost trade-off problem; Zhang and Zhou [47] utilized dynamic multiscale region search algorithm using vitality selection to solve traveling salesman problem; Zhang et al. [48] discussed a multiagent reinforcement learning algorithm for fully cooperative tasks; Mar et al. [49] studied the relational reinforcement learning with guided demonstrations; Liu et al. [50] presented an algorithm-dependent generalization bounds for multi-task learning.
According to the mentioned researches and developments, current solving trends in the literatures show that: (1) more and more TSP variants are proposed for modeling real-world problems and applications; (2) the researchers not only focus on small scale and medium scale optimization for this problem, but also study large scale optimization; and (3) the swarm intelligence algorithms are suitable for solving TSP versions, studying better intelligent optimization algorithms for these problems is significant.Download : Download high-res image (346KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. The example data of MBTSP and CTSP.
Although the above developments have been achieved in recent years, there are still the following problems: on the one hand, some real-world problems cannot be modeled by the existing BTSP variants; on the other hand, the traditional algorithms for these kinds of problems are limited both in solution quality and solving speed. Aiming at the problems, this paper provides a new optimization model called multiple bottleneck traveling salesmen problem (MBTSP), which can model the optimization problems with multiple tasks such as the workflow scheduling of multiple machines, and proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm named VNSGA for multiple scales MBTSP. The MBTSP, having the node set divided into subsets, belongs to the class of generalized combinatorial optimization problems. This category of problems generalizes the classical optimization problem, having the following primary features: the nodes of the underlying graph are divided into a certain number of subsets called clusters, when considering the feasibility constraints of the initial problem, these are expressed in relation to the clusters rather than as individual nodes. For VNSGA, the feasible solutions are constructed by dual-chromosome coding, then it applies crossover operator, mutation operator and variable neighborhood search to optimize the solutions. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm VNSGA can demonstrate better solution quality than the compared traditional algorithms.
The contributions of the paper are as follows: (1) a new optimization problem model named MBTSP is presented, it can be used to model the optimization problems with multiple objectives or tasks; (2) small scale, medium scale and large scale MBTSP experiment data is published for studying; (3) the large scale optimization for MBTSP is studied; (4) a novel hybrid genetic algorithm with variable neighborhood search is firstly proposed for multiple scales MBTSP; and (5) the experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.
The other parts of the paper are as follows: the second section is the definition of MBTSP and relevant theory; the third one gives the VNSGA algorithm for MBTSP; the fourth is experiments and analysis; the last one gives the conclusion and future works.
