Thin scratches on surfaces have interesting optical properties. In 1992, Plummer and Gardner [1] reported the discovery of holographic behaviour in lap abrasion, with three-dimensional effects; mechanically produced scratches acted as a reflection hologram.
Different approaches to a technique for obtaining images from regular scratches were reported in 1995 by Beaty [2], referring to some previous works mentioning the synthesis of 3D images [3], [4], [5]. Beaty developed the circular-scratch technique into a method for creating three-dimensional images. Scratch holography has been the usual name for describing these displays. In [6], Abramson affirms that for the first time, these 3D displays by scratch techniques were obtained by Weil, who introduced its patent in December 1934 in the UK [7], and referred to the technique as incoherent holography [8], [9]. Others similar techniques in copper or aluminum metal are described in [10], [11].
Some elements of the theory for such a “scratch” technique, and how scratches work in the formation of 3D images, have been discussed and explained from different particular viewpoints by Plummer and Gardner [1], Eichler et al. [12], and also by Beaty [13]. These theoretical analyses consider only the circular geometry of scratches. More recently, Brand [14] analysed geometrically, in a more general way, the shape of the surfaces for constructing specular holograms to be formed by fabrication techniques such as milling, grinding, stamping, ablation, etc. Duke [15] used hand-made and mechanical engraves of some particular curvilinear geometries to form abrasive holograms on aluminum plates and by an etching press.
Hologravures as computer-generated holographic laser-engravings using circular-arcs as code curves were presented by Augier and Sánchez [16], [17], [18]. This approach is a generalisation of the scratch-holographic record. Engravings and technology were created in order to allow the competitive use of these displays and to widen its applications, scope and quality by making computer-generated engravings directly by a laser. This technique allows reproduction of hologravures from an original computerised design. As in [16], we have conserved the general use of the term “holography” when referring to this technique of “scratches”, able to encode three-dimensional information, and to the corresponding reconstructed images. Although these displays are not holographic in the strict and original sense of that term, they possess a group of optical properties in common with conventional holograms [1], [2], [8], [13]. Consequently, a hologravure is also considered as a holographic-engraving process to record directly by laser an encoded "virtual-scene" from a 3D computer-generated world onto a 2D engraving, and to recover optically the original scene as a 3D reconstructed image from the real world, by means of appropriate illumination. Thus, for a determined size of the plate, undistorted stereo images can be observed for a wide range of viewpoints under an adequate position of the light source. Hologravures have been exhibited in public art exhibits, in conditions of standard gallery illumination. An example in the transmitted light mode, showing photographs of appropriate quality, can be found in [19].
In these engravings, two-dimensional representations on the recording material are considered as a 2D code that allows the corresponding 3D object image to be recovered. When the engravings are recorded in transparent materials, the reconstructed images can be observed in both the transmitted and reflected illumination modes. Some interesting applications are shown in [16], [17], [18].
Considerations about the internal shape of scratches, as grooves, are not usually found in the thematic literature, although in isolated cases we can find some remark. For example, in [1] the circular scratches made by a lap on nickel plated aluminum piece was analised as curved line-scatterers reflecting the light equally in all radial directions, where each incoming ray is scattered as a hollow cone of rays. The line-scatterer is represented in [13] as a bent rod, and each ray from the point source produces conical sets of scattered rays. It is shown not rigorously how the images are formed; the circular line-scatterer produces both a reflection-mode image sent to one side of reference plane, and a transmission-mode image sent to the other. In [12] the intensity distribution of the fan beam produced by circular scratches is considered experimentally. This paper shows photographs from positions of a possible observer, of a single circular broad scratch with a semicircular profile produced by a turning lathe, illuminated by a light point-source in transmission mode. From each position, one can see two light spots at opposite sites on the scratch. In [16] the quality of the lines traced by the CO2 laser on some materials, as acrylic, polycarbonate, acetate and glass was considered. Microphotographs of the scratches drawn by steel point or laser traces on these materials and measurements of scratch average width are shown. Except in the case of engravings on common glass sheets, where can be observed that the grooves are broken, the reconstructed images from hologravures on other materials were qualitatively satisfactory.
The purpose of this work is to construct a basic theory of hologravures founded on general principles of the light ray behaviour. This approach is a new theoretical and experimental study on general curvilinear-encoding of image information as a novel perspective, allowing the design of engraved images for specific ends. Curves of very general geometric shapes can be used for encoding 3D image information from virtual models onto a 2D engraving. The experimental study of particular cases of curvilinear codes, showing their influence on the 3D reconstructed images, is developed by means of the same CO2 laser-engraver used in [16]. This technique allows an adequate comparison with theoretical analysis.
A sufficiently broad theory allowing the analysis of general curvilinear scratch-codes and its influence on the 3D images obtained from a holographic engraving has not been previously available in the thematic literature. This work contributes to a more complete background of this theory.
