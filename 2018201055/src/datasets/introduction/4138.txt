Non-ionic surfactants, such as alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs), are among the most widely used classes of surfactants in detergents and emulsifiers. These surfactants are most frequently used in domestic, industrial and institutional applications, including paper production, pesticides formulations, leather and textile processing, and cleaning products [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. Other uses of alkylphenols (APs) are in the preparation of antioxidants, curing agents, and heat stabilizers for polymer resins, and in some cases they are applied as an antioxidant itself [7]. The most important members of APEs are nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs) and octylphenol ethoxylates (OPEs), which account for approximately 80% and 20% of the total APEs production respectively [[8], [9], [10]]. Once released into the environment, APEs can degrade to short chain APEs (mono-tri) and alkylphenols (APs) such as octylphenol (OP) or nonylphenol (NP). These degradation by-products are persistent in the aquatic environment, bio-accumulative, and toxic to aquatic organisms [6]. NPs and OPs have been phased out in most developed countries and most of their uses are currently regulated [11]. However, in many developing countries such as those in Africa and Asia, no schedule has been made to reduce the use of NP and use of APEs in these countries may be increasing. For example, the production of NP in 2001 reached approximately 16 000 tons in China [12] increasing to 31 434 tons in 2011 [13].
Dust ingestion [14], air inhalation [15,16], dietary exposure via food and/or water intake [2,16] as well as skin contact [16] with products containing nonylphenol ethoxylates have been shown to be possible routes of human exposure to nonylphenol ethoxylates [2,[14], [15], [16]]. A number of studies have documented adverse effects associated with high level exposure to NPs. These effects include irritation of the lungs, digestive system, and irritation of the eye and skin [17,18]; other effects include antiandrogenic activity [17] and hepatotoxic effects [18,19]. Subsequently, the European Union has included NPs to the list of endocrine disrupting chemicals [20].
Dust from indoor environments can contain elevated concentrations of environmental contaminants and has been shown to be an important source of human exposure to several toxicants [21,22]. Recent studies have shown the significance of house dust as a medium and exposure route for endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) such as NPs and NPEs [14,15,23]. Indoor dust has been implicated as a receptacle and a concentrator of many organic contaminants; hence, levels of contaminants in indoor dust can be used as a proxy to assess the exposure potential to contaminants in the indoor environment [21]. A number of studies have shown the presence of NP and NPEs in settled dust [14,15,[23], [24], [25], [26]]. However, the data with regards to the occurrence of these compounds in African house dust are not available. Therefore, the current study was undertaken to (i) assess for the first time, the levels of APs and APEs in different microenvironments (i.e. homes, offices and classrooms) in Africa; (ii) assess the magnitude of contamination by comparing results obtained with international data; and (iii) estimate occupational exposure to APs and APEs via dust ingestion.
