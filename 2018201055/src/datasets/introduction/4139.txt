Panic disorder (PD) is an anxiety disorder with a high prevalence in society (Kessler et al., 2005, Kessler et al., 2006, Rangé and Borba, 2008). The intense frequent symptoms can impact the quality of life, even causing professional and social difficulties or incapacitation. Patients diagnosed with PD suffers from repeated and unexpected attacks of intense anxiety, which are not restricted to a determined situation or circumstance. The attacks can result in fear of death, fear of losing control, dizziness, palpitations and tachycardia, breathlessness, asphyxia, and others (Rangé and Borba, 2008, APA, 1994, APA, 2013). In this context, PD and its cognitive, behavioral and neurobiological bases have been widely investigated in the last couple of years.
The cognitive model of PD explains that there is an inadequate and dysfunctional processing of external stimuli and bodily sensations in these patients (Rangé and Borba, 2008, APA, 1994, Pauli et al., 1997, Beck et al., 1992, Clark, 1986). They misinterpret some environment or bodily stimuli as signs of danger, setting off the sympathetic activation and consequent bodily sensations of anxiety. These uncomfortable sensations are misinterpreted as confirmation of the danger potential of stimuli or situation, which can produce even stronger anxiety (Rangé and Borba, 2008, Beck et al., 1992). This vicious cycle then presumably induces panic attacks. Neurobiological hypotheses and cognitive processing hypotheses both attribute the PD anxiety to a dysfunctional interaction between the pre-frontal cortex and the limbic system (Windmann et al., 2002).
These hypotheses led many researchers to investigate what were the cognitive deficits related to PD. Mixed results were reported in relation to working memory and PD. Although many research studies showed that patients with PD do not present impairments in working memory (Boldrini et al., 2005, Deckersbach et al., 2011), others subscribe results that points to deficit in this cognitive ability. This impairment can be related to difficulties in the information processing and, consequently, to the misinterpretation of bodily symptoms. In the study conducted by Dratcu and Bond (1998), patients with PD presented impairments of both working memory and explicit memory. The authors explained that such deficits may be related to a high level of excitement and anxiety in patients during the task execution. The post-traumatic stress disorder study conducted by Clark et al. (2009) shows that these patients present a quite different electrophysiological profile, with indicators of both an abnormal fear response and disrupted information processing mechanisms relevant to attentional focus during working memory operations.
In this context, CS movies and virtual reality are techniques that have been used as an important tool to investigate neurobiological parameters. According to Kalckert (2016), virtual reality is an elegant method as it allows perfectly aligning the apparent (visual) position and proprioceptive position of the participant. CS can induce anxiety in patients with PD and agoraphobia (de Carvalho et al., 2008) in an environment fully controllable by the investigator (Botella et al., 2004); and also has been used in research with anxious patients and as a treatment tool of psychotherapy (Riva, 2005). To explore the effects on human brain cognitive functions after the exposure to the CS, we used the quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) functional network analysis methods to examine topological changes in the connection of cognitive regions (Riva, 2005, de Tommaso et al., 2016, Pavone et al., 2016, Vourvopoulos et al., 2016). It is a useful tool to extract the indicators of cognitive load in real-time (Dan and Reiner, 2016). Research studies have been using the qEEG to investigate the communication among brain structures through the coherence function. This function analyzes how much two brain networks are functioning with similarity, in order to study the interactions between brain areas and neural dynamics (Minc et al., 2010). Studies suggest that synchrony communication between frontal and parietal regions support working memory processes (Salazar et al., 2012).
Our electrophysiological variable of interest is the Gamma band (30 and 80 Hz) (Farzan et al., 2010, Li et al., 2015, Ozerdem et al., 2010, Özerdem et al., 2011) because of its strong relationship with cognitive processes (Herrmann et al., 2010), such as attention, working memory and sensorimotor integration (Kim and Kim, 2006, Müller, 2000, Omlor et al., 2007). Previous studies reported a decrease in gamma coherence (GC) as an electrophysiological marker of cognitive impairment (Farzan et al., 2010, Omlor et al., 2007). At the same time, several laboratories have reported an increase in amplitude of gamma-spectrum during sensory and cognitive processes (Herrmann et al., 2010, Teixeira et al., 2011, Basar-Eroglu et al., 1996, Szurhaj et al., 2005). GC has been used in psychiatric studies, investigating bipolar disorder (Özerdem et al., 2011, Velasques et al., 2013), schizophrenia (Farzan et al., 2010) and autism (Peiker et al., 2015). Until the present moment, there is none published study correlating PD and GC, what could be relevant to describe the interference of anxiety on communication of brain areas and how this can affect the information processing. A large portion of computer simulation (CS) potential regarding the research of PD and GC is still unexplored (de Carvalho et al., 2008). With this in mind, we investigated whether PDP manifest working memory impairment and how an anxiogenic CS movie can interfere in a visual oddball task performance.
We hypothesized that the patients diagnosed with PD will present a disturbance in frontoparietal communication, expressed by lower gamma coherence when compared with HC. This hypothesis is based on the already documented working memory impairment in anxiety disorders (Howard et al., 2003, Tallon-Baudry et al., 1998) and PD (Castillo et al., 2010) and the relationship between gamma coherence and working memory (Howard et al., 2003, Tallon-Baudry et al., 1998, von Stein et al., 2000). Therefore, the aims of the present study are: 1) to analyze if there is a difference between PDP and HC in gamma coherence of frontoparietal network; 2) to verify if the high levels of anxiety (produced by a computer simulation) affect working memory of PDP.
