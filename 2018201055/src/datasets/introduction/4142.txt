Contemporary paradigms for non-intrusive biosensors consist of wearable and non-contact sensors. Wearable sensors are made as articles that are worn by people in their daily functioning (e.g., watches used for heart rate monitoring (Picard, 1997)) and can be used to acquire a number of physiological signals such as heart rate, skin conductance, etc. Lin (2011). When using wearable sensors, it is important to consider their degree of intrusiveness as they form an additional layer between the human-machine interactions (Lin, 2008). Non-contact sensors include vision-based sensors such as the tracking of body movements through computer vision (Micelli et al., 2009, Placidi, 2007, Betke et al., 2002, Pavlovic et al., 1995, https://www.leapmotion.com/, Basso Moro et al., 2014), visual attention tracking through eye-gaze monitoring (Lin et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2003, Breugelmans and Lin, 2011a, Breugelmans and Lin, 2011b, Breugelmans et al., 2010, Breugelmans et al., 2009) and video/camera systems for facial expressions (Pantic and Rothkrantz, 2003). For those applications that require contact-based sensing which is ubiquitous in human-machine interaction (Meng and Lee, 2006), Lin developed a new paradigm for biosensors called the natural-contact biosensor (Lin, 2011). The basic idea of the natural-contact sensor is to build unobtrusive transducers into the surfaces where natural physical contact between the user and the machine occurs. The follow overview discusses some developments in the field of biosensing in relation to computer control, and how these developments might be applied to the field of rehabilitation sciences.
