Tires are a key component of automobiles. They come in direct contact with the road and have a significant influence on vehicle performance, including braking force, handling and noise [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Automobile tires are designed to handle various road conditions, and are available as all-season tires, snow tires, mountain tires and mud tires. The shaping of these tires surfaces is very complex, and inadequate rubber flow during tire manufacturing can result in defective tires [6], [7], [8].
The manufacturing of automobile tires begins with the mixing process, which combines crude rubber with carbon black, sulfur, etc. to form a rubber with desirable properties. This is followed by the extrusion process, which produces layers that have the characteristics of each tire component. The rubber layers are then wound to form a cylindrical green tire (GT). Lastly, the GT undergoes vulcanization to become a tire with a designed balance of elasticity and rigidity through the curing process. During the curing process, an expansion tube (bladder) is fitted inside the GT. When high-pressure steam is applied to the bladder, the GT expands onto the mold, adopting its shape, and forming a tire with a complex and unique groove on the tread layer [9], [10]. Since the final shape of the tire is determined during the curing process, it is also known as the shaping process.
A typical automobile tire consists of more than ten layers (tread rubber, carcass rubber, inner liner rubber, sidewall rubber, rim cushion rubber, bead rubber, bead filler rubber, etc.). The outermost tread layer, which comes into direct contact with the road, consists of a main groove, sub groove and kerf. Poor fitting of the rubber into the mold during the shaping process can result in defects, which affect tire performance. In turn, this causes problems with overall vehicle performance, such as braking force, handling and noise [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Assessing rubber flow is thus very important to ensure the proper treading of tires during the shaping process.
There have been numerous studies on tire design, performance and production. J. K. Lee and D. M. Kim analyzed friction on tire tread and stress on tires during driving [2], [16], [17], [18], [19]. K.W. Kim and B. S. Kim studied standing waves in relation to tread patterns and the relationship between groove arrangement and noise [15], [20], [21], [22]. Extrusion, one of the rubber layer shaping processes required for tire manufacturing, has been extensively studied [23], [24], [25]. However, little published research exists on the prediction of rubber flow in a mold during the shaping process. Recently, a computer simulation of rubber flow during the shaping process has been suggested and performed [26]. This research was a very limited simulation, and no experimental verifications were involved.
The present study is an extension of that previous work, and examines in detail the rubber flow in the outermost tread layer of the GT during the shaping process, both experimentally and theoretically. White rubber strips were locally inserted in the tread rubber layer to allow visualization of the rubber flow. Observations were made on the specific flow of the tread rubber in the mold, and the simulation was compared with experimental results. Research results obtained in this study can provide a detailed understanding of rubber flow in a complicated mold, and this also serves as a guide-line for the profile design of the tread layer.
