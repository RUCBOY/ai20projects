Interest in the interactions of hydrogen with various materials is multifaceted [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. It suffices to mention power engineering, protection of metals against hydrogen corrosion, chemical reactor design, rocket engineering. High safety motors can be designed using hydride hydrogen battery. Some problems of hydrogen materials science related to this paper were investigated in Refs. [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. This work is a direct continuation of [17], [18], [19], [20].
Practice has shown that the limitations are not only diffusion processes but also physical-chemical effects on the surface [1], [2]. Transfer parameters depend on the process characteristics of producing the material batch, and one needs effective algorithms for modeling instead of focusing on “tabular data”. We shall focus on the thermal desorption method (TDS) and take into account only the limiting factors and the information capacities of the TDS-experiment.
Let us elaborate on the paper [14] mobilizingly entitled “Towards a better understanding of measurements obtained by hydrogen thermal desorption spectroscopy …” The paper summarizes the studies [11], [12], [13], presents a historical overview, compares the results of theoretical and experimental works. Authors of the paper use the finite element analysis software ComsolMultiphysics (associated with the computing environment MATLAB) to interpret the TDS peaks. Unfortunately, it is hardly possible in this standard software package to account for the boundary conditions caused by the dynamics of adsorption–desorption processes. Specialized software needs to be developed to deal with this problem. At the stage of TDS-degassing the authors of [14] accept zero boundary conditions for the concentrations of hydrogen (the authors specify it as shortcoming), and then focus on a detailed and reasoned analysis of the influence of traps with different binding energies.
In our present work the potential for interpretation of various TDS-peaks is not narrowed but (not without regret) expanded. Basic Fick's law is taken for the diffusion equation. The material is considered to be homogeneous. Capture by defects is negligible. Heating of the plate is relatively slow and uniform. The model does however take into account the dynamics of surface processes. Hydrogen atoms can be accumulated on the surface. Not all the atoms instantly combine into a desorbing molecule. The square-law characteristic of desorption conforms to the Sieverts' law (equilibrium concentration of dissolved hydrogen is proportional to the square root of the saturation pressure). For the considered range of high temperatures, we assumed that near-surface bulk hydrogen concentrations quickly (proportionally) “control” the surface concentrations (the condition of rapid dissolution in comparison with the typical diffusion time scale). These specifications define the range of the model's adequacy.
Even these simplifying assumptions are enough for a two peak structure of the TDS-spectrum to appear at some ratios of diffusion and desorption activation energies. Let us assume that desorption and diffusion processes are time-spaced. By way of clarity only, we go into detail on the experimental procedure. Surface processes are intensified faster than diffusion with a rise in temperature. Desorption “cleans” hydrogen off the surface and near-surface layers. This is how the first peak appears. As hydrogen in the subsurface volume is exhausted, the desorption flux begins to decline. The heating is however continued! The high concentration gradient near the surface is revealed and diffusion gets involved. Conformant to Fick's law, hydrogen is intensively translocated to the surface. Where desorption fails to control the increased influx from the bulk, the surface concentration increases and the second peak of desorption appears. Importantly, this interplay of desorption and diffusion is observed only for a certain ratio of the parameters. Desorption from a relatively extensive surface may overlook the increased influx from the small volume of a thin plate. In this case only a barely visible bend will appear on the TDS-spectrum curve.
Note that multiple peaks on a TDS-spectrum can be added if components corresponding to traps with different binding energies are added to the diffusion equation (see, e. g., [20]). The mathematical implementation is easy. But this kind of model would require the development of specialized software (in Ref. [20] difference schemes were used). For the simplified model in this paper, the authors offer an alternative numerical method for TDS spectrum simulation. With this method it suffices to integrate a system of low-order (compared, e. g., with the method of lines for the solution of distributed boundary-value problems) ordinary differential equations (ODE). Thereby experts in hydrogen materials science can use standard software packages (e. g., Scilab freeware). The suggested method is rather approximate, but mathematically there is no sense in striving for “visual coincidence” of model and experimental curves where the experimental error is estimated at tens of percents.
