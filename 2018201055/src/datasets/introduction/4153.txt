Quick access to the still growing collections of medical documentation is one of the reasons that the demand for IT solutions supporting management of such documentation among plastic surgeons in Poland is very high [1]. IT solutions dedicated to plastic surgery are an example of specific software that processes sensitive data occurring in both text and graphical form. Photographic documentation is very important for plastic, reconstructive, and especially aesthetic surgery practice [2], [3]. The usefulness of photos depends to a large extent on their quality, which concerns, inter alia, their high resolution and standardization [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. In turn, a higher quality of the photographs often is associated with the greater amount of memory needed to store them [9]. Taking into account the fact that during one visit even several dozens of photographs can be taken, management of photographic documentation becomes an essential challenge in plastic surgeons' practice.
Successful deployment of software dedicated to plastic surgeons must comply with the expectations of different groups of users. For example, the same medical record can be processed at the same time by a physician and photographer. In this context, it is very important to carry out the initial stages of software development life cycle (SDLC) in great detail. In the literature they are often described as: requirements capture, analysis and design [10]. They are the basis for implementation (creating), testing, and finally deployment of software. Cases of inefficient e-Health investments, constantly encountered in practice [11], [12], [13], is often equated with the presence of the so-called e-Health paradox [14], reminding us of the need to carry out the initial stages of SDLC.
