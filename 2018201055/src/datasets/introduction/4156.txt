Nuclear power plants are one of the major sources of electricity generation. In Russia, 40% of NPPs have nuclear reactors with graphite used as the neutron moderator and reflector. The design of nuclear reactors did not provide for decommissioning solutions, and there were no safe technologies to handle irradiated reactor graphite [1], [2].
Decommissioning of uraniumâ€“graphite reactors is a combination of complex tasks involving the selection of appropriate methods and techniques for the radioactive graphite handling [3].
One of the ways to reduce the radioactivity of graphite is high-temperature treatment in different environments. Some of the radionuclides pass to a gaseous state under the action of temperature and are removed from the system [4], [5].
Oxidation of radioactive graphite by gaseous gasifying agents, such as air, oxygen, carbon dioxide, steam and their respective mixtures, is tested on a laboratory scale. Computer modeling of the reactor graphite reprocessing by heating in a carbon dioxide environment makes it possible to predict the behavior of radioactive elements.
The paper considers the behavior of calcium, strontium and cesium during the reactor graphite heating in the carbon dioxide atmosphere. The heating of graphite in the carbon dioxide atmosphere may take place during a beyond design basis accident in a graphite moderated gas cooled nuclear reactor.
