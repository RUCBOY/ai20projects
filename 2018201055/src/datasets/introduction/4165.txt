In recent years, a variety of manufacturers have begun to incorporate elastography, a real-time tissue stiffness measuring technique, in ultrasound equipment. The results show that the shear-wave elastography (SWE) has the ability to yield accurate differentiation of benign from malignant breast lesions [1], [2], [3], [4]. The SWE uses the acoustic radiation force instead of the manual tissue compression and is less operator dependent in data acquisition compared to strain elastography [5], [6]. The SWE is a technique based on the local estimation of shear-wave propagation speed. The elastic modulus (E) of linearly isotropic tissues is proportional to the square of shear-wave speed (E = 3ρcs2; ρ, tissue density; cs, shear-wave velocity). From the velocity information, the elastic modulus (in kilopascal unit, [kPa]) can be calculated and displayed in a color-coded image with the option of measuring quantitative elasticity values. Several studies have reported that malignant breast masses show higher elasticity values than benign lesions on SWE images [4], [7], [8]. Using quantitative SWE features, both of the sensitivity and specificity of B-mode US can be improved [4]. However, the reproducibility of the result is still interpreter dependent and significant interobserver variability has been found in reader studies [9], [10]. Therefore, a computer-aided analysis of SWE images is needed to evaluate lesion stiffness objectively and to aid in the task of classification of benign and malignant breast tumors.
The computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of elastography has been explored with SWE images to differentiate benign from malignant breast tumors [11], [12]. On histopathologic analysis, malignant breast tumors often accompanied by the dense fibrous tissues in the peritumoral area compared to benign breast tumors [13], [14]. This finding is concordant with SWE results that the most common site of tumor-associated stiffness is generally in the surrounding stroma rather than the tumor itself [2], [15]. In previous study [12], ten quantitative SWE features of the tumor and peritumoral areas, respectively (elasticity modulus mean, maximum and standard deviation, hardness degree and elasticity ratio) were proposed for diagnosing breast tumors. In this study, a CAD method is proposed based on SWE features extracted from surrounding tumor tissues for classification of benign and malignant breast tumors. The elasticity values of the tumor including the distribution of tissue strains and the distances of the stiff pixels are quantitated and analyzed to the tumor in the elastogram. The performance of a developed CAD based on SWE features is evaluated with a large database. In addition, B-mode features [16] are extracted and combined with the newly developed SWE features to diagnose breast tumors.
