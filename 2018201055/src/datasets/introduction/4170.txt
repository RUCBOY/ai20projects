The initial impetus for this work comes from the field of First Temple Period (i.e., Iron Age in Israel) Hebrew epigraphy (the study of the development of writing through time). Most of the surviving inscriptions dating to that period in Israel are written with ink on potshards (ostraca). These inscriptions are very badly preserved, as they spent three millenniaunderground, and the surviving characters are incomplete, noisy and sometimes barely legible (see Fig. 1).
Traditionally, a newly discovered inscription is first being transcribed manually to create a handmade binarization of the document (facsimile—Fig. 2). These facsimiles are then used to decipher the meaning of the transcribed document, as well as to date inscriptions from unclear contexts [1]. However, the process of creating such transcriptions is subject to human error and in many cases mixes documentation with interpretation. For example, Fig. 4 shows an instance of a transcribed character that did not exist in the original text. As a consequence, one cannot rely on these human-made binarizations as a basis for other document analysis tasks (be it automatic or manual).Download : Download high-res image (423KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

In numerous document analysis tasks, the initial procedure is the creation of a binary image, separating the foreground (characters) from the background. However, in cases of severely damaged documents, such as the ones we are dealing with, the existing algorithms fail to give a satisfactory result (see [3] for example). The reason for this lies in the following facts: (a) the original writing is occasionally erased and therefore its binarization would justifiably be incomplete; (b) the imperfections induced by the long deterioration process might seem as an authentic signal, hence the result would contain unwanted segments (see Fig. 3 for a segmentation of a character using various methods vs. the proposed method). Moreover, contrary to common document analysis systems, where the binarization is just a pre-processing step in a pipeline, the characters’ restorations themselves are of great importance to the field of Iron Age Hebrew epigraphy.Download : Download high-res image (332KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2.

Therefore, we have undertaken to tackle this issue by introducing mathematical techniques from the fields of computer aided design (CAD) and image processing in order to create a semi-automatic approximation of the original characters. Naturally, the resulting restorations will have common characteristics, which will simplify possible future tasks of comparing between scripts originating from different periods or from different regions (i.e., paleography).Download : Download high-res image (549KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 3.

There have been other attempts to introduce mathematical tools to the field of epigraphy but this discipline of research is still in its infant steps (recent work on digital epigraphy can be found in [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], some works related to Iron Age Hebrew epigraphy can be found in [3], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]). Nevertheless, those attempts are not connected directly to the techniques presented below. There are works dealing with reconstruction of damaged handwritten characters as a result of graphics removal (e.g., see the works [18], [19], [20], [21]). However, the deficiencies dealt with in these articles are relatively easy to model, in contrary to the case of natural deterioration processes. Other research fields that are more closely related to our stroke restoration algorithm, are approximation using splines [22]; Active Contours [6] and variational methods in image processing [23], [24].Download : Download high-res image (181KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 4.
