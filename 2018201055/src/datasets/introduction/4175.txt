Liver cancer is the tenth most common cancer and the fifth and ninth most common causes of cancer death in men and women, respectively, in the USA [1]. Many cancers have a high survival rate if detected and treated early [2]. Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most common and robust imaging techniques for the detection of liver tumors [3]. CT provides images of the whole liver through multiphase sequential scans after the injection of contrast media [4].
Several studies have discussed CAD systems for liver tumors using CT images [5], [6], [7]. Chen et al. [5] reported a CAD system that used boundary detection to automatically identify the contours of the liver, and a neural network (NN) classification system using a spatial grey-level co-occurrence matrix (SGLCM) [8], [9] to distinguish a normal liver and two types of liver tumors, hepatoma and hemangioma. Gletsos et al. [7] used average gray levels and 48 texture characteristics with three hierarchically placed feedforward NNs to classify tumors into healthy, cyst, hemangioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma groups, however segmentation of the tumors was done manually using regions of interest. In the study by Zhang et al. [6], the authors used an automatic edge detection and subtraction process [10] to detect hepatocellular carcinoma and a 3-layer feedforward NN to differentiate the degree of cirrhosis in the liver, which was derived by integrating two shape and seven grey-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features [8].
This study developed a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system with semi-automatic region growing segmentation technique. Three kinds of features were extracted for analyzing between benign and malignant, including features of texture [11], [12], [13], [14], shape [15], [16], [17], [18], and kinetic curve [19], [20], [21]. Texture was quantified using GLCM [8] including the relative position and density of the tumor. Shape was classified using an elliptic model [17], [18], and a kinetic curve was generated to represent changes in density between each phase on the CT images. To simplify the kinetic curve, we used the four features proposed by Chen et al. [20], [22] including maximum enhancement, time to peak, uptake rate, and washout rate.
