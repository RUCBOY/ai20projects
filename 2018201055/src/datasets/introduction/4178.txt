Computer generated hologram (CGH) is attracting more and more attentions now as it is a key technology for dynamic 3D holographic display [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]. Heavy computation load of holograms generation is one of the main bottlenecks in real-time holographic imaging. Many accelerated algorithms have been proposed in recent years to improve the calculation speed of CGH. These methods can be divided into two categories: the point-based method and the fast-Fourier-transform-based (FFT-based) method [6]. The point-based method is the simplest and most flexible approach, which can achieve higher reconstructed images quality than the FFT-based method [7]. In addition, it is suitable for parallel processing and hardware implementation to achieve fast computation speed In this study, we focus on the point-based method majorly.
Coherent ray trace (CRT) is an original point-based CGH algorithm but it is time consuming and is rarely used directly in rapid generation of fringe patterns [8]. Lucente [9] proposed a look-up table (LUT) method in 1993 to increase the computation efficiency of CRT method. The calculation speed of this method was significantly increased while lots of memories were consumed to store the table. To overcome this storage problem, Kim [10], [11], [12], [13] proposed a Novel-LUT (N-LUT) algorithm whose space complexity decreased significantly. In 2009, Pan [8] proposed a split look-up-table (S-LUT) method which can achieve much faster computation speed than the LUT method with a smaller size table Generally, these look-up table methods have a high requirement on memory space.
In 2012, Nishitsuji et al. [7] proposed a calculation method of CGH using the circular symmetry of zone plates. In this method, a pattern generated from one point light source was regarded as a zone plate and holograms could be synthesized by generating and overlapping the zone plates of all points using their circular symmetry properties. Yang [14] also proposed a similar approach which was called the line scan (LS) method. Using the centrosymmetry and axisymmetry of the principal fringe patterns in the N-LUT method, only the intensity data of the scan line in the principal fringe pattern needed to be calculated and stored. In another Radial Symmetric Interpolation (RSI) method, which was proposed by Lee [15], [16], [17], [18], a Fresnel zone plate is periodically sampled along a diagonal line and the wave information of a point hologram is calculated by linear interpolation. Thus the amount of computations is reduced compared to the analytic method. Methods of [7], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18] all compute intensity values of holograms along a diagonal line only and here we call these approaches line hologram methods uniformly. Xie [19] calculated the complex amplitude distribution of the center point of an object in advance and the field distributions of rest points on the hologram plane could be given from the pre-calculated field by applying translation and aberration operations. The computation speed of this approach is much faster than that of the conventional CRT method.
The generation of CGH is high parallelizable and high data dependent [20]. Parallel computing can speed up the calculation process of CGH but increase the communication load between processors [21]. Shimobaba et al. [22], [23], [24] developed special-purpose computers HORN for holography using FPGA technology which shown excellent computational speed [25]. However, high cost and long development time are restrictions of this approach. With the development of GPU devices, GPU-based technology are more and more used in the generation of CGH [26].
In this article, we present a depth compensating accelerated generation method of CGH using the symmetry and similarity of zone plates. We are aimingat providing an approach to obtain a higher calculation speed of CGH with less memory storage. Instead of slicing object points into layers, we use depth compensating to compute the patterns of points with different depth positions. An improved LUT method is proposed during the calculation of distances between objects and hologram pixels in the XY direction The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, conventional point-based acceleration approaches for generation of CGH using symmetry and similarity of zone plates are introduced. In Section 3, our accelerated calculation method of CGH is presented in detail. Optical and numerical experiments are carried out in Section 4 to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Conclusions and future work are presented in Section 5.
