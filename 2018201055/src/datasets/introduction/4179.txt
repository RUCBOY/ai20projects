With the continuous progress of science and technology, people's requirements for computing speed are also increasing. The main means of increasing computing speed for computers is to increase the processing power of the CPU, and to enhance the CPU's processing power mainly depends on the increase of chip integration [1], [2], [3]. Since the first tube computer was invented in 1946, the Moore's Law is always verified by the CPU's development. However, due to the limit of RC time-constant, CPU's integration will reach its upper limit sooner or later [4], [5], [6], [7]. Ternary optical computer (TOC) is a photovoltaic hybrid computer, which uses mature liquid crystal technology to realize optical computing. It uses the common, cheap, stable electronic chip as control components, and uses opt-electronic hybrid manner to store data. TOC's architecture includes three key elements, which are using optical signal to computing, using electrical signal to control and using opt-electronic hybrid manner to storage data, respectively [8], [9], [10], [11]. The second-generation experimental system of TOC has thousands of data-bits that can be reconstructed easily, and these data-bits can easily be extended. Based on the second-generation experimental system, a series of experiments have been carried out, which confirmed that the main advantages of TOC are giant data-bits parallel computing and reconfigurable processor [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. In addition, TOC uses liquid crystal devices (LCDs) and embedded systems as the main components [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. The energy consumption of these components is very small, so TOC's energy consumption is accordingly small even if it has a large number of data bits [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. In current experiments, the energy consumption of a TOC, whose computing power is equivalent to dozens of CPU, is not more than a PC. In the current study phase about TOC, double-rotator-structure ternary optical processor (DRSTOP) proposed by the author is better than the others in reconfiguration speed and efficiency. DRSTOP's computing capacity can reach 2000 bit×1 GHz. When facing large-scale data processing problem, the computing capacity of DRSTOP is equivalent to hundreds of CPU. Besides, it does not require special cooling equipment, which means that it can save considerable energy [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. It can be seen, DRSTOP has a wide range of applications and high application value. The work and control mechanisms of DRSTOP discussed in this paper will play a key role in specific applications.
