Data mining refers to the extraction of valid patterns, hidden information and relationships from large datasets [1]. This interdisciplinary subfield is employed in banking, insurance, and marketing for cost reduction and quality improvement [2]. Recent years have witnessed a surge of interest in utilizing machine learning and data mining in the field of medicine for early diagnosis [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10].
Cardiovascular disease is the most widespread cause of death the world over. Particularly, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common cardiovascular condition.
CAD occurs when at least one of the left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary (RCA) arteries is stenotic [11].
In order to diagnose CAD, physicians currently employ different methods, among which angiography is widely regarded as the most precise method. It is, however, associated with high costs and major side effects, hence researchers have long sought to devise precise diagnostic modalities. In fact, a large number of investigations have been conducted in this field [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], with the UCI datasets [35] being the most frequently utilized sets. These datasets, however, are not up-to-date.
In the present study, given the risks of invasive diagnostic procedures such as angiography and auspicious experiences in the field of data mining, attempts were made to propose a model for identifying coronary arteries disease.
The suggested detection model, based on artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms, can detect coronary artery disease based on clinical data without the need for invasive diagnostic methods.
The present research primarily introduces the required background information; in the subsequent four sections, the proposed method, experimental results, related works and conclusions will be discussed.
