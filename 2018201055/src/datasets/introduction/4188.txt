Edge detection has been a fundamental operation in computer vision. It is used most frequently for image segmentation based on abrupt changes occurred in image intensities [1]. Edge detection is considered a critical preprocessing step for many applications such as object recognition, segmentation, and active contours. Traditional methods for detecting edges used many techniques to compute the gradients, then non-maximal suppression [2], [3].
It is difficult to find a unified approach to edge detection due to the variety of visual phenomena to which correspond salient edges. Similarly to traditional methods, many recent papers have used the gradient to detect image edges [4], [5], [6]. Other methods were inspired from the natural computing [7], [8], [9], [10], these methods used neural network or membrane computing to find edges. Type-2 fuzzy systems were also employed to detect image edges [6], [11], that can be combined with Sobel detector to achieve the same purpose [11].
Giannarou et al. [12] presented a framework that combines preselected edge detectors based on the correspondence between their outcomes. The authors proposed two techniques to analyze statistically the correspondence of edge images emerging from multiple operators. Their first technique used the ROC analysis and the second one used the weighted Kappa coefficient method, however, there is a trade-off between detection of minor edges and noise reduction in the weighted Kappa coefficient method. In [13], the Kerr type of nonlinear optical material was used to detect image edges, its operations speed is very high but it is suitable just for white and black images. Later, a vector quantization combined with an edge detection method was used to segment images and was presented on SOM neural network to realize the algorithm adaptively [14], this approach is mainly devoted to medical images. Many other methods [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] have concerned about edge detection, Wu et al. [17] proposed an edge detection method based on a local dimension of complex networks using the weighted combination of the euclidean distance and gray-level similarity indices. There is a trade-off between finding image edges with precision and the time requirement. The majority of the cited works tried to improve the detection quality without decreasing the complexity of their methods.
Wavelet transform has been a good method for edge detection, which has been shown by several recent studies [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. Wavelets based methods are more exact than other methods and are considered better than traditional methods [27]. Faber Schauder Discrete Wavelet Transform (FSDWT) is one of the most important wavelets since it has numerous important properties in image processing. To our knowledge, the first and unique work using FSDWT in edge detection was the work of Douzi et al. [28]. The problem of wavelet-based methods is the choice of extrema coefficients, this choice is done based on a given threshold which is not automatic in several methods.
In this paper, we present a new method to detect image edges based on the FSDWT and Otsu threshold. We have chosen the FSDWT because it can be used as a multi-scale edge detector and it has a simple lifting scheme with only arithmetic operations which make our algorithm low complex. In addition, we use the Otsu threshold to choose the FSDWT extrema coefficients which are located on image edges. Since the three fundamental steps performed in edge detection are [1]: image smoothing, edge points detection and edge linking, our proposed method begins by smoothing the image, then detects edge points and finally links edges. Our main contributions are:
•Automatic image smoothing as a preprocessing step based on the bilateral filter.•FSDWT extrema coefficients selection based on Otsu threshold.•A low complex edge detection method owing to the use of FSDWT.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the FSDWT and the Otsu threshold. Section 3 gives details about the proposed method. Section 4 discusses the experimental results and comparisons and section 5 draws the conclusion.
