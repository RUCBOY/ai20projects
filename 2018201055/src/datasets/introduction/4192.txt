Consumer-oriented Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) are software systems that aim to help information consumers making informed decisions about their health [1]. With shared decision making on the agendas of many health organizations [2], [3], [4] and an increasing number of patients who are willing to be involved in their own health decisions [5], consumer-oriented CDSSs can be an effective tool to enable patient empowerment, thus allowing patients to become active participants in decisions about their healthcare and, at the same time, allowing them to make sensible use of healthcare resources. Among the different types of existing consumer-oriented CDSSs [1], symptom checkers allow patients to register a set of symptoms and receive a list of possible diagnoses or advice about what actions might be appropriate to perform (self-triage) [6]. The first symptom checkers were static websites or CD-based applications [7], and they were not widely deployed by health trusts. However, with an increasing pressure on primary care, and studies showing that up to 50% of the visits to a general practitioner’s (GP) office were unnecessary [8], [9] and up to 70% were minor health incidents [10], consumer CDSSs, and particularly symptom checkers, have caught the attention of health organizations. Nowadays, several health organizations have started using symptom checkers to develop broad diagnostic and self-triage systems to guide each patient to the most appropriate action [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. For example, the symptom checkers offered by the Mayo Clinic [14] and WebMD [16] provide information about the possible diseases linked to the symptoms reported by the patient. The British NHSDirect provides a more self-triage oriented service that combines a web application for patients to report symptoms with a call center where nurses provide advice. The appropriate use of symptom checkers can have a significant impact both on patient health and health organizations [6]. Regarding patient health, a symptom checker can help patients to perform self-care, avoiding unnecessary medical attention [8] (e.g. visits can be managed by consulting with a pharmacist) [8], or it can help them to access and process health information rather than search Google, thus avoiding the problems involved in consulting raw information with different quality and technical levels [17], [18]. Regarding health organizations, symptom checkers relieve the pressure of unnecessary visits by guiding patients to the appropriate health circuit. For example, in 2011, NHSDirect avoided 1.5 million unnecessary surgery appointments and 0.7 million emergency calls [15], [19]. Although more evaluations are needed, recent studies have indicated that investments in web-based symptom checkers already have good outcomes for emergency cases but need improvement in non-emergency and self-care cases [6], [20]. This is interesting, since the investment needed to develop them is moderate compared to other health interventions. For example, Elliot et al. reported that the accuracy of web-based symptom checkers and telephone triage lines are comparable [21].
However, when direct human support is not provided by these systems, the appropriate communication of health information by the user is paramount, so the system provides appropriate guidance. This involves a challenge in the design of inquiry methods and user interfaces for symptom checkers since health information usually contains clinical terms, quantitative measures and time patterns [22] that users need to understand to provide accurate communication about their health conditions. In fact, little is known about how patients understand health information [1] or how patients perceive their conditions in contrast to how health professionals characterize and see them [3]. Therefore, assumptions about general user interface design cannot be readily applied and metrics for symptom recording Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) still need to be established. This makes the design and evaluation of each symptom checker’s user interface a unique process. That evaluation needs to effectively assess how successful the system is in communicating the clinical concepts that patients must understand to accurately communicate their health information. In fact, there may be many differences among users and many may have problems interpreting their health information considering that only 30–60% of citizens are health literate [23]. How successful that communication is will be the main factor influencing how accurate the system is in providing advice to the patient. Otherwise, even with advanced recommendation algorithms, if poor quality information is provided, the system will end up in a “garbage in, garbage out” situation. In such cases, a consumer CDSS may mislead the user rather than provide support for health related decision-making, driving some of them to increase unnecessary GP visits, or worse, advise others to perform self-care when they may be suffering a life-threatening condition. Therefore, besides measuring design usability flaws, techniques to evaluate Human Computer Interaction (HCI) between users and CDSSs are needed to determine if a cognitive gap exists between the clinical concepts that the GUI exposes and the user’s interpretation of the information requested. Only when that gap is minimized will it be effective and safe to deliver a symptom checker.
