Cancer is the uncontrolled growth and spread of cells. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that has risen to be the second cause of death among women. A fundamental characteristic of all forms of cancer is that the earlier they are detected and attended to, the easier they are able to be cured. This is because the growth rate of the affected cells can be exponential [1]. The Cancer Health Center (CHC) noted that most cases of cancer are detected and diagnosed after a tumor can be felt or when other symptoms have developed [2]. Breast cancer has the second highest mortality rate in women next to lung cancer and is the most common type of cancer in 140 countries of a total of 182 evaluated nations [3]. The US prediction on breast cancer towards 2019 revealed that about 268,600 new cases of invasive breast cancer would be diagnosed, 62,930 new cases of carcinoma in situ will be diagnosed, and 41,760 women will die from breast cancer [4]. Although these figures may appear to mirror what is obtainable in most developed economies, research has also shown that almost 50 % of breast cancer cases and 58 % of deaths occur in less developed countries. The low survival rates can be explained mainly by the lack of early detection of the disease with over 33 % and 81 % of the population in ages 30–49 years, and 30–59 years, respectively [[5], [6], [7]]. Recently, the American Cancer Society estimated that in 2019 [78], 30 % (14,460) of women diagnosed of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), a type of breast cancer, were in the age gap of 60–69; 28 % (74,820) of those in that same age group progress to have the invasive cancer (an advanced stage of breast cancer); and 24 % (9920) eventually died. In a separate report, US alone was reported to have 1,806,590 new cancer cases and 606,520 cancer deaths were projected for the year 2020 [79], while [80] showed that the estimated rate of new cases is 128.5 per 100,000 and death rate is 20.1 per 100,000 women per year.
The challenge of early detection of breast cancer has promoted research in computer-aided detection (CAD) systems. The high impact of CAD has increased the number of cancers detected by 19.5 %, increased early-stage malignancies detected from 73 % to 78 %, achieved a recall rate of 7.7 %, and detected 50 % of the cases of architectural distortion missed by human experts [8]. Although different approaches like rule-based systems, logic and prolog are some traditional CAD systems adopted for this purpose, however, some of these systems have not been successful at limiting the number of false diagnoses. This has, therefore, advanced research in the area of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) in drastically limiting false diagnosis, false positive rates and increased early detection. CNN and deep learning techniques generally are a type of CAD systems which are based on recognition of patterns while processing images to extract certain set(s) of features. We have directed the focus of this research at the use of deep learning methods for mammograms. This will help us detect if it is of malignant or benign or normal case based on the digital image. We exploit the presence of architectural distortion (AD) in mammography to carry out this differential task. This is necessitated due to the fact that 12–45 % of cancers missed in mammographic screening are AD [3]. Note that malignant cells are cancerous cells which start from abnormal cell growth and might spread rapidly or invade nearby tissue while benign cases are considered as noncancerous, these can be easily removed from the body [9].
Mammography is a type of medical imaging used for screening and diagnosis of breast cancer. It is the most useful and common tool employed by the radiologist when looking out for speculated masses, microcalcifications, bilateral asymmetry and architectural distortion [3,10]. This implies that making findings from it largely depends on experts – the radiologists. However, screening carried out using this tool is highly characterized with false positive results, over-diagnosis of insufficient lesions, different interpretations of screening results, unreliable/low accuracy of detection and diagnosis, increasing need for carrying out additional examinations, and limitation of the radiologist who makes the findings, thereby leading to patient anxiety [11,12]. These notwithstanding, mammography has made significant contributions towards the early detection of breast cancer, even the detection of something as subtle as architectural distortion [10,13,14]. On the other hand, the technique of biopsy is another method applied to confirm the presence of breast cancer [81]. The study in [82] attempted to apply the combination of K-means, fuzzy C-means, competitive learning neural networks and Gaussian mixture models as clustering techniques in detection of breast cancer based on biopsy images. Architectural distortion is the alteration of the architecture of a normal breast. The presence of architectural distortion does not necessarily mean that it must present with mass or calcification. But this distortion in breast architecture usually manifests in mammographic finding as speculations radiating from a point, focal retraction, and straightening at the edges of the parenchyma [15,16]. Architectural distortion, due to its subtle nature and low prevalence, is, however, frequently discovered in retrospective assessments of false-negative mammography and may represent the earliest manifestation of breast cancer.
Deep learning models have demonstrated great results by improving the state-of-the-art in identifying subtle abnormalities like architectural distortion [69,70]. The application of deep learning technique has proven that using classical methods such as Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) [83], multi-resolution wavelet [84], Gabor Filter [[85], [86], [87], [88], [89]], pattern recognition [90] for feature selection and classification in characterization of abnormalities in breast images are ineffective and deficient [91]. Hence the adoption of the use of deep learning models which are based on the deep arrangement of layers which are able to extract features in images (and other forms of data) with multiple levels of abstraction [17]. CNN, which is a type of deep learning model, is used in detecting architectural distortion in digital mammography, in addition to localization of regions of interest (ROIs), classification of findings, image retrieval, and risk assessment. The layers which often stack up to build a CNN model are convolutional layer, pooling layer and fully connected (fc) layer [18]. Variation of hyperparameters (depth of model for example) in CNN has produced different CNN architectures namely: CiFarNet [19], AlexNet [20], GoogLeNet or Inception v1 [21], Inception v3 [22], Inception v4 [23], Xception [24], ResNeXt-50 [25], ResNet [26], VGG [27] and LeNet [28]. These novel architectures have attracted a wide range of acceptance and application among researchers largely due to their outstanding performances even in the detection of architectural distortion [[29], [30], [31], [32]].
Generally speaking, studies have supported the need for advanced tools and techniques for accurate diagnosis and classification of breast cancer since the segmentation and classification phases are challenging [73,74], hence the motivation for the adoption and adaptation of deep learning techniques for these tasks. In addition to that, the major challenge of using CNN for detection of abnormality in mammography is limited data which usually lead to high false positive rates, a poorly trained CNN model that does not generalize and results in overfitting [[33], [34], [35]]. Secondly, another related challenge which may lead to high false positive rate is associated with low contrast in the datasets of mammogram images available for use in CNN models [36]. This calls for the furtherance of research to advance CNN beyond the limitations of radiologists and traditional CAD systems which are duped into having sensitivity ranging from 62 to 87 % and specificity from 75 to 91 % for human experts [37], and sensitivity of 50 % with the number of false positives per image equal to 1.0 for traditional CADs [35]. Thirdly, there are few research efforts geared towards the detection of architectural distortions in digital mammograms, and these are often missed or difficult to detect when screening mammograms [32,43]. The fourth research opportunity aimed at improving deep learning models for detection of ADs remains variation in sizes of ROIs. Although the first problem has been partly addressed by using transfer learning (TL) and data augmentation techniques, these solutions are yet to sufficiently harness for a significant reduction of false positive rates of detection [38] and improved detection of AD. Whereas some literature has argued in favor of the use of both the ground truth-size-based ROIs and fixed-sized ROIs, others have attempted to adapt CNN models to whole mammography images. These input size variations are still a hot topic of research.
The effectiveness of mammography as a tool for screening and diagnosing breast cancer is still relevant [39]. Furthermore, it is also well observed that deep learning models are capable of yielding unprecedented performance on some tasks, given sufﬁcient data [40,35]. In addition to this, the standard and synthetic approaches for data augmentation have produced significant performance in curtailing overfitting. Although techniques like dropout, batch normalization, batch re-normalization or layer normalization have also contributed immensely to tackling overfitting of deep learning models, we still argue that the use of the synthetic approach for data augmentation is not yet sufficiently exploited.
To address the above challenges, we propose an improved computational solution to aid the accurate detection of breast cancer abnormality architectural distortion. This study employed the use of data augmentation [41] technique in generating new synthetic dataset to achieve a CNN model that effectively generalizes. This research investigated the effect of combining both fixed-sized and variable-sized images into the proposed CNN model. The model was adapted to be able to compare images from the left and right breasts and also the craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral-oblique (MLO) view of each breast. Also, we tweaked the model to increase the performance of our proposed CNN architecture by generating augmented data to increase training data.
The main objective of this study is to design a CNN-based model for the detection of architectural distortion, and apply data augmentation technique to improve the accuracy in reducing false positive classification of architectural distortion. The novelty of our work lies in the proposed CNN model designed, implemented and trained from scratch, the combination of datasets resulting in a good number of experimentations, and the outstanding classification performance for architectural distortion. Specifically, the technical contributions and novelty of the proposed model are hereby highlighted below:
•Design of a novel CNN-based model for detection of architectural distortion. The proposed model is able to accept multi-size inputs and images of different views.•Application of a data augmentation approach based on the traditional method of flipping and rotating of images. We experimentally chose the best values for the required parameters (e.g. angle of rotation of image).•Enhancement of the proposed CNN model to investigate the likelihood of obtaining performance improvement when whole images are served as input.
It is noteworthy to mention that the new deep learning model presented in this study was able to achieve a reduction of false positive rates due to the detection of architectural distortion in images in digital mammography. Similarly, we applied the proposed model and the augmentation technique to a good number of benchmarked datasets to validate the robustness of the model. Further, to validate the efficiency and practicality of the proposed model, it was applied to different augmentation operations. This was done under different experimentation to investigate what combination of operations presents the optimal performance of the proposed model. Finally, a performance evaluation analysis reported in the later section of this paper shows that the new CNN-based model achieved superior accuracy when compared to similar existing state-of-the-art CNN models.
The remaining part of this paper is organized in the following order: Section 2 is focused on reviewing related works in data augmentation techniques, image cropping approaches for the extraction of ROIs, and use of deep learning models in detecting abnormalities in mammography. Section 3 presents the technical contributions of this paper. In Section 4, we report the experimentation carried out based on the proposed model. Furthermore, Section 5 presents the results and discussion of the experimentation. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 6.
