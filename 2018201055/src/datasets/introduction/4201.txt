Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a health disorder in which a malfunction in the secretion of insulin causes hyperglycaemia. It is also a disorder of social importance due to its high incidence - DM is estimated to affect 592 million people in 2035 [1]. In the long term, it can cause microvascular complications that affect the retina, resulting in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), which is the leading cause of blindness in active population [2]). There are three forms of DR: 1) Macular edema, i.e. the build-up and spill of fluid in the macula; (2) weakening and changes in retinal blood vessels, resulting in microaneurysms, haemorrhages, malformation and vascular tortuosity (Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy, NPDR) that can subsequently cause an abnormal growth of retinal blood vessels (Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy, PDR); and 3) retinal capillary closure, a form of vascular change considered as a potential blinding complication in diabetes [3].
DR severity is well known to have a close association with the duration of DM. However, most diabetic patients have no symptoms in early retinopathy stages, when treatments to prevent vision loss (laser therapy and/or vitrectomy and/or intraocular pharmacological intervention) are effective. By analysing the cumulative evolution of DR throughout 25 years, the Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy (WESDR) found that patients who were diagnosed most recently with a similar duration of diabetes had a lower prevalence of PDR regardless of glycosylated haemoglobin levels, blood pressure levels and the presence of proteinuria [4]. Among individuals with type 1 diabetes, DR is not often present at the time of diagnosis. However, as many as 21% [5] (nearly 40% in UKPDS [6] of individuals with type 2 diabetes already have retinopathy by the time diabetes is diagnosed). This difference is the basis for the American Diabetes Association's recommendation of initial screening within 5 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes and shortly after diagnosis for type 2 diabetes. In case no evidence of retinopathy is found in one or more eye exams, examination every 2 years may then be considered. If DR is present, subsequent examinations for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients should be repeated annually by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. If the retinopathy is progressing or sight threatening, more frequent examinations will then be required [7]. Therefore, systematic screening programmes in the diabetes community are needed for early DR detection, and to reduce blindness in diabetic patients.
Nowadays, DR screening programmes are performed by fundus imaging analysis. While this procedure does not replace the examination performed by an ophthalmologist, it does provide reliable information as to whether a patient is beginning to be affected by the disease [8], [9]. However, due to the high incidence of DM, the number of daily examinations required for the proper control and follow-up of patients is very high. For instance, based on 2035 estimations, 3.2 million eyes would need to be examined every day. In this context, integrating systems that analyse fundus images and automatically detect signs of DR will ensure sustainability and quality in the prevention of the disease. This is why there has been a great interest in the development of systems that detect early ophthalmic signs of illness in recent years (see Refs. [10], [11], [12], [13]).
Some prototypes of such systems have already been presented [14], [15], [21], [16], [17], [19], [18]. They are mainly evaluated by measuring sensitivity and specificity of automated retinopathy detection, regarding clinical diagnoses provided by ophthalmologic specialists. The system proposed by Usher et al. [14] classified a set of 1406 fundus images from 703 diabetic patients as abnormal or normal (affected by DR or not) according to the presence or absence of microaneurysms, haemorrhages and exudates. At the 0.890 sensitivity setting, the system obtained a specificity of 0.624. Philip et al. [15] presented another disease/no disease grading system based on the detection of red lesions (microaneurysms and haemorrhages). The sensitivity and specificity of automated grading (detecting technical failures or any retinopathy) of a set of 14,406 images from 6722 patients attending a DR screening programme were 0.862 and 0.768, respectively. Abramoff et al. [21] evaluated the performance of a DR-related lesion detection system (red and bright lesions) built from published algorithms in a large screening population (10,000 patients from the EyeCheck diabetic screening project [22]), reporting a sensitivity of 0.84 and a specificity of 0.64. Niemeijer et al. [16] extended the evaluation to 15,000 eye exams (60,000 images) to propose information fusion methods and evaluate their effect on the performance of a complete comprehensive automatic DR screening system. The best performing fusion method obtained an area under the receiver operator characteristic curve of 0.881, reaching a sensitivity of 0.929 at a fixed specificity of 0.6. Dupas et al. [17] evaluated an algorithm for the automated detection of microaneurysms on 761 fundus images included in the Messidor database [23]. The sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm to detect DR were 0.839 and 0.727, respectively. On this same database, Antal et al. [19] evaluated an ensemble-based DR screening method based on microaneurysm and exudate detection, reporting a sensitivity of 0.90 and a specificity of 0.91. Abramoff et al. [18] validated a computer DR detection programme on 874 people (1748 images) with diabetes at risk for DR. The programme is based on published methodologies for image quality assessment and detection of microaneurysms and haemorrhages, exudates and cotton wool spots, as well as, irregular lesions. Authors reported a sensitivity of 0.968 and specificity of 0.594, none of the 6 false-negative results had sight-threatening diseases. Finally, deep learning techniques are being used recently to design DR-detection algorithms, with very promising results. For example, in Ref. [20], a convolutional neural network was used to detect DR in EyePACS-1 (9963 images, 4997 patients) and Messidor-2 (1748 images, 874 patients) data sets. Sensitivity/specificity results were: 90.3%/98.1% and 96.1%/93.9%, respectively. Results are shown in Table 1.Table 1.

The structure of the paper is as follows: The material used to evaluate the DR detection system will be described in the next section, together with the procedure used to design it. The methodology and the generation of automated diagnoses are explained and illustrated in Section 3, while the results from comparing system and human diagnoses are presented in Section 4.
