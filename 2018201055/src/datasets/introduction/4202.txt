Schizophrenia is a severe mental disease which has a major impact on patients’ quality of life (QoL). Psychiatric admissions are frequent (Gustavsson et al., 2011, Wittchen et al., 2011) and hospitalization costs account for the largest share of the total direct costs in several countries (Heider et al., 2009). The cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are likely to impair psychosocial functioning (Wykes et al., 2007, Hoe et al., 2012, Peña et al., 2012) and may also have a major bearing on mental healthcare costs (Mackin et al., 2011; Harvey et al., 2012).
Cognitive Remediation Therapy (CRT) is a form of psychological intervention which “aims to improve a wide range of cognitive domains with the goal of durability and generalization” (Cognitive Remediation Experts Workshop, Florence, April 2010). Previous meta-analyses suggest that CRT produces improvements in cognition, and the moderate effect sizes in schizophrenia (McGurk et al., 2007, Wykes et al., 2011) and in early schizophrenia (Revell et al., 2015) bear witness to its effectiveness. CRT also achieves an additional improvement in functional outcomes (Vita et al., 2011, Wykes et al., 2012) and may promote the ability to learn and enhance the effects of other treatments (Mueser et al., 2013). It has even been suggested that CRT may favor neural plasticity (Eack et al., 2010, Penadés et al., 2013).
Positive associations between neurocognitive performance and QoL have also been found (Addington and Addington, 2008, Alessandrini et al., 2016, Savilla et al., 2008), and authors have suggested that neurocognitive dysfunction may have a bearing on self-esteem (Hesse et al., 2015; Lysaker et al., 2007) and on measures of well-being (Garrido et al., 2013). However, CRT is time-consuming, and concerns have been raised about its costs (Owen et al., 2010). For this reason, investment should be channeled towards helping patients, studying the economic dimension of treatments, and using budgets as effectively as possible (Cloutier et al., 2016, David, 2010, Tajima-Pozo et al., 2015). With regard to cost-effectiveness, only a few studies of the effect of psychological intervention for schizophrenia patients on acute psychiatric admission rates are currently available (Hastrup et al., 2013, VanMeerten et al., 2013).
Computer-Assisted Cognitive Remediation (CACR) is a practical treatment strategy in schizophrenia (Grynszpan et al., 2011, Katsumi et al., 2015). However, there are two key factors to consider with regard to its use: the durability of its outcomes over time, and its cost-effectiveness. As far as its durability is concerned, cognitive improvement has been confirmed after six months of follow-up (Bell et al., 2007, Fisher et al., 2010, Subramaniam et al., 2014), after one year (Bell et al., 2008, Hogarty et al., 2006, Tan and King, 2013) and even after two years (Tao et al., 2015). Most studies in the literature focus on psychosocial functioning (Deste et al., 2015, Eack et al., 2010); very few have focused on well-being measures in the long term (Fisher et al., 2010, Poletti et al., 2010, Wykes et al., 1999). A small number of studies have highlighted the cost-effectiveness of CRT (Patel et al., 2010, Reeder et al., 2014), while others have described the effect of CACR on clinical course (Trapp et al., 2013) or analyzed its impact on the use of psychiatric services (Vita et al., 2016). However, until now no study had assessed the longer-term effect of CACR on the cost of acute psychiatric admissions beyond one year of follow-up.
The aim of the current study is to investigate the effectiveness of CACR in improving neurocognitive, quality of life and self-esteem outcomes 12 months post-treatment, and also to analyze its impact on health care costs and on acute psychiatric admissions in the longer term. We hypothesized that patients who received CACR would present a sustained benefit over a 12-month follow-up period, and that the number of acute psychiatric admissions 12 months, 24 months and 36 months post-therapy would fall, as would the associated costs.
