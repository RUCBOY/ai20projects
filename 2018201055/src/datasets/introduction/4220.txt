A naive picture of the cooling of micro-segregated mixtures would be that, because of the enhancement of the Boltzmann factor, the micro-segregation would increase, further increasing the concentration fluctuations. However, concentration fluctuations can occur differently at different k-vectors, as measured by the partial structure factors [1]. Macroscopic thermodynamic concentration fluctuations occur at k = 0 [2], [3], which are not necessarily related to specific forms of local clustering - or micro-heterogeneity - which could occur at non-zero k-vectors [1]. This distinction is not immediately intuitive, but is a logical consequence of density correlations defined as  <δρi(1)δρj(2) >, where δρi(a)=ρi(a)−ρ¯i is the fluctuation of the density of species i at location a around the average density ρ¯i, and  <.. > designates a statistical ensemble average. Obviously, the first moment  <δρi(a) > =0 because of the macroscopic homogeneity, but the second moment depends on the relative position between two molecules, hence on all the associated k-vectors. Previous experimental and computer simulation studies of fluctuations in room temperature aqueous alcohol mixtures under ambient conditions, have shown that both concentration fluctuations - as measured through the Kirkwood-Buff integrals (KBI) [4], [5], and micro-segregation - as observed through computer simulations [6], [7], are notably increased, specifically with the increase of the number of methyl groups of the alcohol molecules [8]. In a recent study of the temperature dependence of aqueous methanol mixtures [9], we have found that these mixtures looked near ideal, as far as their KBI were concerned, while showing more specific micro-segregation than for room temperature, as witnessed by the increase of the structure-factor pre-peak.
In this study, we extend to very low temperature regions the simulations of two specific mixtures, namely when mixing water with ethanol or tert-butanol (subsequently abbreviated as tbutanol), with the aim to determine the respective status of concentration fluctuations and micro-segregation under these constraints. This is particularly relevant for the case of aqueous-tbutanol, for which several studies have pointed out the strong micro-segregation under ambient conditions [10], [11], [12], [13], as well as the high concentration fluctuations as measured through the Kirkwood-Buff integrals, obtained through calorimetric measurements [14] as well as radiation scattering experiments [15], [16]. The present simulation study clearly indicates that the KBI markedly decrease at lower temperatures, making these mixtures look nearly ideal. Yet, these mixtures still exhibit micro-segregation of the water and alcohol molecules.
Similarly to the previous one, the present study is strictly restricted to static properties, with the aim to relate configurational molecular properties to correlation functions and related KBI thermodynamical properties. The investigation of dynamical properties, in particular those related to lifetime of clustering, and in relation to spectroscopic properties and other experimental properties, will be developed in subsequent studies.
The picture which emerges from this study is that, lowering the temperature, which amounts to increase the various Boltzmann factors, selectively enforces water segregation with respect to the alcohol segregation, since water molecules form linear chain-like clusters, which wind through the mixture. It is this specific topological form of the aggregation of water which leads to the decrease of thermodynamic concentration fluctuations. This picture is more appealing when stated in the opposite direction: the increase of temperature melts/destroys the supra-molecular chain clusters of water, hence increasing the concentration fluctuations as well as making the segregated water domain larger and more disordered. Indeed, as the water clusters become larger, the Hbonding patterns become more diverse, and the linear clustering specificity of smaller cluster is lost.
Chain-like water clustering might appear at first as strange, since water is well known to be a tetrahedral liquid [17], [18], [19]. However, the tetrahedral connectivity would hold only in the optimal bulk conditions. Even then, it was recently proposed that pure water may be formed mostly of dimers instead of tetramers [20]. In any case, it is conceivable that, under dilution, that water molecules may not be able to group into tetramers, and would statistically achieve better H-bonding through chain-like patterns. This was found to be the case in aqueous mixtures of dimethyl-sulfoxyde [21], whereas in aqueous tbutanol mixtures water would form larger clusters with increased tetrahedral connectivity [22]. The fact that, under mixing conditions, water would decrease its number of hydrogen bonding with decreasing temperature is not obvious, and would probably depend on the nature of the solute. The behaviour of water in cold mixtures has been previously addressed by other authors [23], [24], [25]. For example, the behaviour of water in cryoprotectant mixtures is of genuine physical interest [24].
As stated in the beginning, a generic mean field argument, involving spherically averaged interactions, would predict the demixing of water and alcohol when lowering the temperature, and in particular it will predict the associated increase of concentration fluctuations. It is the opposite which is observed here. This is due to water giving up tetrahedral connectivity to prefer chain connectivity under crowding with the solute molecules. This failure of the mean field argument, seems to contradict the near ideal behaviour of these mixtures, demonstrating that mean field and low fluctuations are not necessarily collateral properties. This is possible precisely because water molecules can change their Hbonding topologies, hence allowing to transfer concentration fluctuations at k = 0 into a domain pre-peak at k≠0. This is an interesting illustration of the plasticity of water. Many aqueous mixtures, such as 2-butoxyethanol-water [26] or tetrahydrofuran-water [27] mixtures, exhibit lower critical solution temperatures (LCST), and subsequent demixing at high temperatures. The mechanism for remixing at lower temperature could reside in the property of water that we point out here, namely transfer k = 0 concentration fluctuations modes into k≠0 localized aggregates.
