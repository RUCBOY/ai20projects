The soil bacteria Agrobacterium are a natural vector for the transfer of single-stranded (ss) transfer DNA (T-DNA) from the tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid into the plant cell. The T-DNA nonspecifically integrates into the host’s chromosome through the agency of agrobacterial and plant proteins and is inherited at subsequent cell divisions (see reviews in Gelvin, 2009, Gelvin, 2010, Gelvin, 2012, Chumakov, 2013, Liang and Tzfira, 2013). T-DNA translocation relies on a type IV secretion system and presumably occurs during a close membrane contact mediated by a protein structure or channel (Jakubowski et al., 2009, Lessl and Lanka, 1994). The T-DNA–VirD2 complex, together with the virulence proteins VirE1, VirE2, VirE3, VirD5, and VirF, is transferred via a VirB-dependent channel (Jakubowski et al., 2009, Banta et al., 2011, Chandran et al., 2009). A mutation in Agrobacterium protein VirB10, a member of the regulatory membrane complex, was shown to affect the extracellular VirE1, VirE2, VirE3, VirD2, VirD5, and VirF proteins and T-DNA secretion through a VirB-dependent pore channel (Banta et al., 2011). It has also been reported that the T-DNA–VirD2 and VirE2–VirE1 complexes are transferred to the plant cell independently (Sundberg et al., 1996, Mysore et al., 1998, Сhen et al., 2000, Simone et al., 2001, Humann et al., 2006, Guo et al., 2007).
In 1987, Engstrom et al. were the first to suggest that agrobacterial VirB proteins are involved in conjugative contact and pili formation (Engstrom et al., 1987). In 1993, Kado et al. first presented evidence that the virB2 gene encodes the synthesis of propilin, a structural T-pili protein (Lai and Kado, 1998, Jones et al., 1996). It was found that VirB2 protein is secreted from agrobacteria and forms long flexible hollow structures (T-pili) (Engstrom et al., 1987, Kado, 1994, Eisenbrandt et al., 1999, Kurbanova et al., 2001), which also include VirB5 and VirB7 proteins, located at the end and base of T-pili, respectively (Schmidt-Eisenlohr et al., 1999, Aly and Baron, 2007). It is believed that T-pili play a key role in agrobacterial infection and ssDNA transfer into recipient cells (Anthony et al., 1974, Fullner et al., 1996, Kurbanova et al., 2001). There is some evidence that the VirB/VirD4 channel is required for DNA and T-pili excretion from the agrobacterial cell (Banta et al., 2011). The architecture of the T-pili channel for T-DNA transport is not entirely clear, but it seems that the outer diameter of the ssT-DNA-VirD2 complex (4 nm) is greater than the inside diameter of the T-pili channel (Volokhina et al., 2012). So, there has not yet been any direct evidence for T-DNA transfer via the T-pili channel across plant cell membranes.
VirE2 is a single-stranded (ss) DNA-binding protein (Christie et al., 1988, Dombek and Ream, 1997, Abu-Arish et al., 2004, Dym et al., 2008, Bharat et al., 2013), that in addition to protecting ssT-DNA from the host cell endonucleases (Yusibov et al., 1994, Volokhina and Chumakov, 2007), may also perform other functions. The VirE2 protein can interact with an artificial lipid membrane, increasing its electrical conductivity in the presence of an electric field (Duckely and Hohn, 2003, Chumakov et al., 2010). It is believed that the VirE2 pore facilitates the transfer of ssDNA through a lipid bilayer (Dumas et al., 2001), and purified recombinant VirE2 stimulates the accumulation of short synthetic oligonucleotides in HeLa cells treated with lipofectin (a transmembrane transport stimulator) (Dumas et al., 2001), as well as in native HeLa cells (Volokhina et al., 2012). However, there is no any direct evidence for T-DNA transfer via a VirE2-depending pore across plant cell membranes.
In a buffer, VirE2 is present as a complex made up of two or more proteins, as determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) method (Volokhina et al., 2011). In a probabilistic model for a structure composed of two and four VirE2 proteins, integration into a lipid bilayer was demonstrated (Volokhina et al., 2012). To date, however, there has been no direct evidence that VirE2 mediates the formation of a channel in the host cell membrane for T-DNA transfer through VirE2-dependent pores.
The aim of this work was to perform a computer simulation of VirE2′s pore-forming capacity and an evaluation of constructed VirE2 complexes by the molecular dynamics and normal modes methods.
