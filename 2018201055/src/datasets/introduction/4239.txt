Buildings that have all structural elements permanently loaded with tension are usually called pneumatic structures (from Greek “pneuma” meaning breath of air) [1]. Pneumatic structures were introduced to the building technology and practice only few decades ago [2], [3], even though they had been in use many years before [4] as open pneumatics (membranes) for sails, tents and shelters. According to Pauletti [5] three basic types of pneumatic structures are known: air-supported (insufflated), inflated and aspired structures. The first two seems to be the most widely spread and used. The air-supported structures require steady flow of air to keep them under tension, whereas the inflated structures gain stability due to the fixed air pressure, being usually higher compared to the pressure needed to keep the air-supported structures erect. The aspired structures are characterized by the inner sub– pressure making them possible to achieve specific shapes, such as the Floating Theatre constructed by Herzog in 1970 and exposed in Osaka EXPO′70 (Japan). Herein, we are focusing on an air-supported structure made by DUOL company (Slovenia) [6], resembling from the constructional point of view the air-supported structure presented for the first time by David H. Geiger (United States pavilion) at the 1970 Expo in Osaka [7], [8].
Because the use of air-supported structures is spreading fast, there is an urgent need for the evaluation of their properties. In this respect, the illumination of their interior with light is one of important issues that help designers and users decide how to make and use them consciously and with minimal cost.
Many aspects of pneumatic skins in architecture have been reported by A. Gomez-Gonzales et al. [9]; the possibility to erect a large structure in confined urban spaces and catenary shape to resist the gravity loads combined with excellent materials; the possibility to use translucent fabrics providing sufficient daylight inside the structure and diminishing the needs for electrical lighting during the day. However, so far little research has been undertaken looking at their optical properties. In this study we aimed at getting information about the optical properties of the membrane fabrics of the double skin air-supported structure of DUOL. Total transmission values (TTvis) were obtained from the spectral total transmission measurement (TT(λ)) of the air-supported membrane fabrics determined with the help of integrating sphere.
The type of fabrics has always been and still is the key for successful commercialisation of pneumatic structures [5], [10]. In general, textile membranes and/or foils are used. Architectural fabrics are often woven polyester (PES) yarns that are partially or completely coated with polyvinylchloride (PVC) such as used for DUOL air-supported structure, or made from glass fibre yarns that are coated with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE) or silicone. Yarns assure strength and longevity, while the over-coated thermoplastic polymer enables welding of fabrics. Optical properties are of paramount importance; due to the presence of PES fabrics and high thickness, fabrics scatter light and become translucent. (TTvis) is in the range from 0 up to 40%. For example, translucency of the DUOL membranes is below 10%.
From the optical point of view, foils (for example ETFE ethylene tetrafluoroethylene) in the form of inflated lenses (National Space Centre in Leicester (2001) and Eden Project, biomes in Cornwall (2001) both by Nicholas Grimshaw) perform better compared to yarn reinforced fabrics. Importantly, they are very light, presenting merely 1% of weight of a comparable glass structure, and at the same time show transmittance up to 95%. Allianz Arena in Munich (Swiss architects Herzog and de Meuron, 2005) and the 2008 Beijing Water Cube designed by PTW Architects (Australia) are typical examples.
However, foils have some drawbacks. Due to much higher light transmittance compared to fabrics, in pneumatic structures based on ETFE foils overheating is usually a problem. This has led to suggestions [11], [12] to use switchable electrochromic [13], [14], thermochromic [15] and thermotropic [16], [17] systems made of polymeric foils. The corresponding optical switchable (i.e. chromogenic) systems provide solar light intensity modulation through the system by the application of electric pulse and/or increasing temperature of the glazing system, respectively.
One the other hand, high optical transmittance of foils makes it possible to use them as bi- or multifunctional membranes, where two (or more) different properties are combined at the same time. For example, foils could be used with silica aerogels [18], where aerogel does not jeopardize optical throughput of the foil/aerogel/foil composite membranes. Such attempts to compensate high thermal transmittance of single or multilayer membrane envelopes are not new and were discussed already in 1987 by Huntington [3], highlighting the Lindsay Park structure (today Repsol Sport Centre) in Calgary, built in 1983. In the envelope of this building a translucent thermal insulation with 20% light transmittance was incorporated between outer and inner membranes with 18% and 90% transmittance, respectively. At present, there exist at least two commercial types of aerogel-based daylight systems on the market, i.e. Scoba-lit and Okagel® windows [18]. The aerogel used in these two systems has a thermal conductivity of 0.018 W/(m.K) and a heat transmittance coefficient between 0.6 and 0.3 W/(m2. K) for layers of 30 and 60 mm thick Okagel®, respectively. In this study we considered Spaceloft® Aspen Aerogels, Massachusetts, USA), a fibrous nonwoven batting (10 mm thick) with incorporated aerogel, which is pliable and soft enough to form blankets translucent for light. Accordingly, the aerogel blanket enclosed in two PE (polyethylene) fabrics was inserted between two ETFE foils and the optical properties measured with the help of integrating sphere. The corresponding TTvis and TRvis values were then used for the computer calculations of the light illuminances in the air-supported structure having identical dimensions as the DUOL structure.
In this study, we focused on experimental determination of the distribution of light on the floor of the playground inside the DUOL air-supported structure by using daylight factors (DFs) [19]. It should be noted that the number of experimental determinations of illumination levels inside and outside the buildings with the help of DFs values is relatively low [20], [21], when compared to the numerous validation studies done with the daylight simulation programs. Simultaneous indoor and outdoor measurements of direct and diffused illuminances in a full scale test building have been done by the British Building Research [22] and Daylighting Laboratory of the National Research Council Canada (NRC) in Ottawa giving data for various test cases with low, intermediate and high complexity, such as basic side lit space with a standard double glazing space with diffuse light-shelf [20], translucent panels instead of clear glazing [23], and external venetian blinds [24]. Accordingly, 45 different floor positions inside the DUOL structure were selected, the corresponding DFs were experimentally determined [25] for two sets (set1 and set2) of different sky conditions and the observed differences compared to the DFs values obtained by the DAYSIM [26] computer program calculations. Preliminary studies of the DUOL air - supported structure have been presented recently at the PLEA 2015 conference [27].
In the beginning, the DFs were determined by simple spreadsheet calculations [28] and split flux method, followed by advanced calculation techniques based on radiosity [29], [30]. In the late 1980's Greg Ward at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [31] introduced backward raytracing Radiance program which served for the development of a DAYSIM program, making it possible to make daylight simulation studies based on daylight coefficient method, originally produced by Tregenza and Waters [32].
It should be noted that the Radiance program allows simulation of buildings with complex geometries and various reflection and transmittance properties of the envelope. The Radiance (and DAYSIM) program has been validated in series of simulation predictions [23] showing how closely simulations could predict physical measurements under many different sky conditions in full–scale spaces with either clear glazing, without or with venetian blinds [33] and lightshelfs applied [20], [34], or translucent glazing [23]. The DUOL structure could be considered as an extreme example, because its whole structure works as translucent glazing. For the DAYSIM calculations the structure was segmented into smaller sections with the cylindrical central part described by rectangular surfaces and double curved ends approximated by triangular surfaces facing sky. CIE standard overcast sky [25] was used in the calculations, because it resembled the overcast sky of the day (5000 lx) when the actual measurements were performed, and it allowed highly reliable comparison of the calculated DFs to the experimentally obtained quantities. Due to the limited experimental data, because direct and diffuse light measurements were not available, the Perez all weather sky model data [34], [35], [36] could not be used, which limited our calculations of the DFs at CIE (static) sky illuminance conditions. Finally, the DAYSIM computer calculations were used for the determination of the DFs values for various DUOL interiors painted with various colour patterns. The corresponding DFs distributions served as indicators for the light levels inside the structure and helped us to obtain the information about the influence of various colours on the internally reflected component (IRC) of light inside the DUOL air-supported structure. The DAYSIM computer calculation showed quite high DFs values (i.e. from 4.3 to 5.1%) for the air-supported structure equipped with the ETFE/PEfabric/aerogel/PEfabric/ETFE optically translucent/thermal insulating composite membranes.
