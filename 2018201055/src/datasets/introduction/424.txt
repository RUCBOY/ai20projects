Holography can produce realistic virtual images due to its capability to properly convey the depth cues that we use to interpret 3D objects. Computational holography is technique used for holographic construction and reconstruction with digital representations plus numerical calculation. The development of phase only spatial light modulator (SLM) provides an efficient way to dynamically reconstruct computer-generated holograms (CGHs) [1], [2], [3], [4]. The applications of CGHs involve not only holographic display but also pattern recognition [5], optical encryption [6], beam shaping [7], optical tweezers [8], etc. Although CGH has the potential to reconstruct all 3D information of an object, complicated 3D modeling and time-consuming computation are big challenges faced by current 3D holographic display.
According to the classification of primitives, 3D CGH calculations can be realized by using point-, polygon-, layer-, and stereogram-based methods [9], [10]. In the point-based approach, the 3D scene is represented as aggregated point sources [11], and the CGH for this 3D scene is then calculated by accumulating the light from the point sources into CGH. Although the computational process of this CGH is simple, the amount of calculation is usually very huge. Point-based method with look-up tables (LUTs) is an effective way for the wavefront of point light sources can be precalculated [12], [13]. However, the amount of memory space employed to store the precalculated wavefront data is also very huge. The polygon-base method represents the 3D scene as aggregates of small planar polygons. The calculation of the optical field of the polygon facet is performed by finding the relationship between the angular spectra represented in the hologram plane and in the local plane containing the polygon facet [14], [15], [16]. The most essential but cumbersome operation is the coordinate rotation in the Fourier domain, which is also computationally expensive. The layer-based method expresses a 3D scene as a combination of a set of predefined parallel depth images [17], [18]. The hologram is obtained by numerically propagating individual layers to the hologram plane and accumulating them with different ways. This method greatly reduces the calculation load of 3D scene while the image quality is relatively decreased. The calculation speed could be further increased by different approaches, such as region fraction [19], and inverse Fresnel diffraction approach [20]. Stereogram-based method spatially multiplex 2D parallax views of the 3D scene. CGH is segmented into multiple holographic elements, and the parallax views are captured by perspective projections from corresponding viewpoints. The computational cost is decreased greatly, but the quality of depth images is problematic due to the fact that the reconstructions are essentially 2D images.
In this paper, two simple but effective methods have been proposed to realize holographic 3D display by PFreD and PFraD. Our method belongs to the layer-based methods, specifically, it is a kind of region fraction method. A 3D object is first divided into many layers in longitudinal direction, which are parallel to the CGH plane, and then these layers are calculated into corresponding sub-holograms with PFreD or PFraD. The final CGH is generated in a side-by-side way of the sub-holograms. Fig. 1 schematically shows the 3D reconstruction of the proposed method. As we can see in Fig. 1(b), the sub-holograms, which are calculated from a series of squares with different size in Fig. 1(a), are arranged side-by-side without superposition. The results reconstructed from the hologram are shown in Fig. 1(c). Every layer has been centered along the axis of propagation again.
