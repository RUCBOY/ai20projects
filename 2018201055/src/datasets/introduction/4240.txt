Laser based holographic projection from a computer-generated hologram (CGH) can provide high brightness, high contrast and wide color gamut images. Moreover, since holographic technique has potential for reconstructing all the three-dimensional (3D) information of an object in space, holographic projection is also considered to be the most potential technique to achieve true 3D display without any wearable devices. However, the huge amount of three dimensional information results in long calculation time in CGH generation for projection 3D object. Many methods have been proposed in order to accelerate the calculation of CGH. For example, the point based method with look-up tables is an effective method in which the wavefront of point light source is pre-calculated and saved in a look-up table (LUT) [1], [2], [3], however, it requires large memories for the storage of LUT. Other popular methods include the layer-based methods [4], [5], [6] and the polygon-based methods [7], [8], [9]. In these methods, the basic idea is to model the 3D object into numerous 2D planes, either parallel planes or tilted planes, and the calculation of CGH can be converted from 3D information to 2D planes in which the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm could be employed for further accelerating. Nevertheless, the total calculation time of CGH is proportional to the numbers of the modeled planes. While this number is always large (sometimes more than ten thousands planes) in order to accurate sample a 3D object, these methods are still remains cumbersome. Recently, a simple method of CGH calculation based on the nonuniform sampled wavefront recording plane (WRP) method is proposed [10], which is derived from the well-known WRP methods invented by Shimobaba [11], [12]. This method allows calculating CGH only from 2D intensity map of a 3D object by establishing a virtual plane close to the object, therefore the calculation can be accelerated by using the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) algorithm.
Another important field of holographic projection is color projection. Holographic color projection can generally be realized by: time division [13], [14], depth division [15], [16] and space division [17], [18]. In time division method, three sub-holograms of red, green and blue component of color object are calculated and displayed on the SLM in sequence, in which we need to control each laser source and sub-hologram synchronously. In addition, this method requires very high frame rate devices to display sub-holograms for the effect to be seen by a human eye. Another kind of method use only one SLM to achieve color projection, Makowski proposed a method by dividing one SLM into three regions with each region loaded one component hologram [17], but the resolution is lost by taking advantage of only one third of the whole SLM for one color component. More effective method is to use multiplexing by encoding three color components into one SLM with whole area [18]. However, most of these methods only consider the projection of two dimensional color images. For dynamic holographic 3D projection, Gaolei Xue proposed a method to reconstruct full color 3D object by modeling its complex amplitude [19]. In this method, the CGH of each color component is calculated using polygon-based methods and three CGHs are synthesized into one CGH by multiplexing encoding method. However, the calculation time of the CGH will be proportional to the numbers of the modeled polygons.
In this paper we propose a method to simply calculate CGH for color holographic 3D projection, based on the combination of the nonuniform sampled WRP method and the multiplexing encoding technique. The CGH calculation is simple and fast, the calculation time is independent on the number of object points. The CGH is capable to reconstruct zoomable color 3D object in holographic projection system.
