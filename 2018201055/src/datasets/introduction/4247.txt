The presence of the transversal intersection between stable and unstable manifolds for fixed point or periodic orbit is one of the main technical tools used to prove the chaotic behavior of the deterministic dynamical system (see for example [16] and the literature given there). In the context of the small perturbations of an integrable system the basic analytical technique used to establish the transversality is the Melnikov method [23] introduced in 1963. V.I. Arnold generalized these ideas to produce the first example of what is now called Arnold Diffusion [1]. In fact the (now widely-used) Melnikov function (see for example [19], [28]) is, up to a constant, exactly the integral that Poincaré derived from Hamilton–Jacobi theory to obtain his obstruction to integrability in the restricted three body problem in [27].
Melnikov type methods are based on investigating integrals along homoclinic orbits to normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIMs) [9], [11], [12], [19], [23], [28]. There are natural problems with such approach: It is very rarely the case that one can establish analytic formulae for such homoclinics. In most cases they are not known, and then computing integrals along them is impossible. The second problem is that even if one has an analytic formula for the homoclinic, the integral in question can be very hard to compute. In most real life systems such integrals would not be expressed through simple formulas.
One way to overcome such problems, adopted in [18], is by using exponential dichotomy and rigorous numerics. This evolves using approximate homoclinics, error bounds, and computer validated Newton type operator.
We resolve these two problems in a different way. Firstly, we investigate the dependence of the manifolds on the parameter using geometric and computer assisted tools. The slopes of the manifolds depending on the parameter follow from cone condition type bounds in the state space extended by the parameters. Second order derivatives also follow from geometric structures. This way we obtain bounds on the stable and unstable manifolds of NHIMs, together with their dependence up to second order on the perturbation parameter. We then propagate these bounds using rigorous (interval based) integration up to a section where they meet. Based on the bounds, and in particular using the dependence on the manifolds on the perturbation parameter, we establish transversal intersections for a given, explicit, range of perturbations. The range is large enough so that for the larger parameters from the range we can detect the transversal intersections directly, and continue to higher perturbations using standard techniques.
Our contribution to the existing theory is twofold:
Firstly, in this paper we develop a method for establishing center unstable manifolds of NHIMs, in the context of ordinary differential equations. The main benefit from our approach is that we do not need to assume that the NHIM exists in order to apply our method. (Our method is constructive, not perturbative.) We formulate assumptions, which guarantee the existence of a center-unstable manifold within an investigated neighborhood. The assumptions of our theorem depend only on the bounds on the first derivative of the vector field. These guarantee that the center-unstable manifold exists, and is a graph of a function within the investigated region. The method gives explicit bounds on the slope of the manifold. Moreover, by considering bounds on the second derivative of the vector field, we obtain explicit estimates on the second order derivatives of the center-unstable manifold. By changing the sign of the vector field, the method establishes existence of center-stable manifolds. By intersecting the center-stable manifold with the center-unstable manifold we establish the existence of a NHIM within the investigated region. Our method also establishes bounds on the first and second order dependence of the manifolds on the parameters for families of ODEs. Summing up: the method is explicit, establishes existence of the manifolds over a specified, macroscopic domain, all assumptions can be verified from simple estimates on the first and second derivative of the vector field, and gives explicit estimates on the dependence of the manifolds on parameters.
Our second contribution is developing a Melnikov-type theory for establishing transversal intersections of stable/unstable manifolds of NHIMs. The method is based on interval arithmetic integration of ODEs and propagation of local bounds on the manifolds up to the point of their intersection. The benefit from our approach is the following. We do not have to know any analytic formulae for the homoclinics. They are established using rigorous computer assisted numerics. Secondly, we do not need to compute any integrals. All bounds on the manifolds are propagated by our integrator in form of rigorous, interval arithmetic bounds for the jets. This method allows us to establish intersections of the manifolds for specific ranges of parameters. These ranges are large enough to later continue the proof of the intersections of the manifolds using standard continuation arguments.
We emphasize that, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first computer assisted Melnikov type method, which works over an explicit parameter range. Since our method does not rely on analytic computations along homoclinics, we believe that our approach is very versatile and can be applied to numerous problems that are not accessible to the standard methods.
The paper is organized as follows. We first address the problem how to establish transversal intersections of manifolds for given ranges of perturbation parameters, under the assumption that we have bounds on the first and second derivatives of the stable/unstable manifolds of NHIMs. This problem is introduced below in subsection 1.1, and the main idea behind our approach is explained in subsection 1.2. We then follow up with full details in section 3, where the formulation is made precise and the main results are proven. Secondly, we address how to establish the needed bounds for the derivatives of stable/unstable manifolds. In section 4 we recall the results from [7], where such bounds are established in the setting of discrete dynamical systems. In section 4 we also extend the method to obtain explicit bounds on second derivatives of the manifolds. In section 5 we further extend the results from section 4 to the setting of ODEs. We make sure that the needed assumptions follow from the bounds on the vector field, so that we do not have to integrate the ODEs. As the by-product we obtain also a generalization of results from [7] about establishing of NHIM for ODEs. In section 6 we give an example of application of our method.
An alternative to [7] and its extension presented in this paper for obtaining bounds on derivatives of stable/unstable manifolds of NHIMs, is the parameterization method [3]. This method is suitable for application to computer assisted proofs. (For examples of such applications see [2], [4], [8], [15], [21], [24], [25], amongst others.) We believe that our approach to Melnikov method (from sections 1.1, 1.2, and 3) could also be successfully combined with [3].
In the two subsections that follow we specify the setup under which our paper is written and outline the main idea.
1.1. The setupIn this section we formulate our main goals and set up the notation. The problem is formulated in the simplest possible setting. We consider a non-autonomous perturbation of an autonomous ODE on the plane. This enables us to present the main features. Our method though can be applied in a much more general setting.We consider a vector fieldf0:R2→R2, and a functiong:R2×R×R→R2. We assume that g is 2π periodic in the last coordinate. We shall consider the following family of time periodic ODEs(1)(x,y)′=fε(x,y,t)=f0(x,y)+g(x,y,ε,t). We assume that for ε=0 there holds g(x,y,0,t)=0. This means that we treat g as a perturbation, with ε being the perturbation parameter.We shall assume that for ε=0, (1) has a hyperbolic fixed point (x0,y0) and that we have a homoclinic orbit along the stable/unstable manifold of (x0,y0).Since the fixed point is hyperbolic, for ε≠0 it will be perturbed to a 2π periodic hyperbolic orbit. We shall use a notation γε(t) for this orbit and assume that such orbits exist for ε∈E, where E⊂R is a closed interval around zero.In order to investigate the intersections of the stable/unstable manifolds of γε we consider a section Σ, which is transversal to the homoclinic orbit (which exists for ε=0). For ε≥0, the stable manifold of γε for the problem (1), with initial condition starting at time τ will hit Σ at a point, which we denote as ps(ε,τ). Similarly, by pu(ε,τ) we denote the point of intersection of the unstable manifold with Σ.Remark 1The construction of the points ps(ε,τ), pu(ε,τ) is made precise and carried out in full detail in section 3.1. Fig. 1 gives a graphical illustration of the setup.Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. The perturbed orbit γε(s) in green (which coincides with Λε), its unstable manifold in blue and stable manifold in red. The two points on Σ = {y = 0} are pu(ε,τ):=Pu(wu(ru,ε,κu(ε,τ))) and ps(ε,τ):=Ps(ws(rs,ε,κs(ε,τ))). In red, we have the trajectory along the solution of the ODE, which leads to pu(ε,τ). The (signed) distance between pu(ε,τ) and ps(ε,τ) is the δ(ε,τ). (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)We then define the (signed) distance δ between the two manifolds on Σ as(2)δ(ε,τ):=pu(ε,τ)−ps(ε,τ). The main question is to establish conditions on δ(ε,τ) that ensure that the stable/unstable manifolds of such orbits intersect transversally, for all ε∈E∖{0}.The above setting, in which we are perturbing a fixed point, is the simplest one. In general we could be interested in intersections of stable/unstable manifolds of perturbed NHIMs. The tools for establishing such manifolds and their perturbations, together with all the ingredients needed to apply our method are developed in [7] for maps, and are generalized to ODEs in section 5. There are no obstacles to generalizing to such setting. We restrict ourselves though to the simplest case for the sake of clarity of exposition and postpone detailed treatment of the general case for NHIMs for later publication.
1.2. The main idea in simplest termsWe consider a C2 function δ:R×S1→R, which is defined in (2). Since for ε=0 the stable and unstable manifolds coincide forming a homoclinic orbit, we know thatδ(0,τ)=0for all τ∈S. For fixed ε∈R we will use the notationδε(τ):=δ(ε,τ). Let E be a closed interval in R, which contains zero. Our aim is to give a simple set of assumptions that will lead to a conclusion that for any ε∈E∖{0} the function δε will have nontrivial zeros. In other words, that there exists a ξ(ε)∈S1 such thatδε(ξ(ε))=0,dδεdτ(ξ(ε))≠0.For A⊂R×S1 we shall write[∂δ∂ε(A)]:=[inf(ε,τ)∈A⁡∂δ∂ε(ε,τ),sup(ε,τ)∈A⁡∂δ∂ε(ε,τ)].When comparing an interval I⊂R with a number a∈R, by writing a<I we mean that for any b∈I, a<b.Our idea is based on the fact that for any ε∈E∖{0}(3)δε(τ)ε∈[∂δ∂ε(E×{τ})]. This means that if we can establish that for some τ1,τ2∈S1(4)[∂δ∂ε(E×{τ1})]<0<[∂δ∂ε(E×{τ2})], then for any ε∈E∖{0}, by (3) and (4),δε(τ1)ε<0<δε(τ2)ε. Hence, by the Bolzano theorem, there exists a ξ(ε)∈[τ1,τ2], such thatδε(ξ(ε))=0.If in addition to (4) we have that(5)[∂2δ∂τ∂ε(E×[τ1,τ2])]>0, then for any τ∈[τ1,τ2]ddτ(δε(τ)ε)∈[∂2δ∂τ∂ε(E×[τ1,τ2])]>0. Thus, for each ε∈E∖{0}, the point ξ(ε) is unique anddδεdτ(ξ(ε))≠0.To sum up the above discussion, in order to show that for any ε∈E∖{0} we have nontrivial zeros of the function δε, it is sufficient to verify (4) and (5). We emphasize that in this approach we have an explicit range E of ε for which the nontrivial zeros exist.Summing up, to compute the Melnikov distance δ, our method combines two ingredients, both computer assisted:•the geometric method to establish explicit bounds for normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds and their stable and unstable fibers, together with their dependence on parameter;•the rigorous C2-integration of our system away from the NHIM. This method can be generalized to many dimensions.
