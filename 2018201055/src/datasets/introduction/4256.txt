Membrane distillation (MD) has significant potential for small-scale solar thermal seawater desalination in remote coastal areas. In the MD process, a microporous hydrophobic membrane is used to facilitate the transport of water vapour while retaining liquid water and hence all non-volatile substances and dissolved salts; therefore, ultrapure water can be obtained from seawater MD desalination [1], [2]. Unlike pressure-driven membrane desalination processes such as reverse osmosis (RO), MD utilises a vapour pressure gradient induced by a temperature difference across the membrane as the driving force for water transfer. Thus, water flux in MD is not affected by the feed water osmotic pressure [3], [4].
MD is arguably the most suitable platform for small-scale and off-the-grid seawater desalination applications [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. MD is less susceptible to membrane fouling than RO given the absence of a high hydraulic pressure and the discontinuity of the liquid phase across the membrane. As a result, MD can be operated without feed water pre-treatment, making it an ideal process for small and stand-alone seawater desalination applications. Furthermore, MD systems can be made from inexpensive and noncorrosive plastic materials to reduce process investment and operational costs. Finally, MD can be operated at low feed temperature [10], [11], [12]; thus, low-grade heat sources such as solar thermal energy can be utilised to meet MD energy demands.
MD can be applied in various configurations including direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD), air gap membrane distillation (AGMD), permeate gap membrane distillation (PGMD), vacuum membrane distillation (VMD), and sweeping gas membrane distillation (SGMD). Amongst these configurations, DCMD has the simplest arrangement and thus is probably best suited for small-scale seawater desalination applications [13], [14]. In DCMD, the hot feed and the cold distillate are in direct contact with the membrane, allowing for efficient heat and mass transfer to and from the feed and distillate membrane surfaces, and thus facilitating high water flux [14], [15]. However, the direct contact configuration also facilitates the heat conduction through the membrane, thus rendering DCMD less thermally efficient than other configurations.
Numerous experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the feasibility of DCMD using low-grade heat sources such as waste heat and solar thermal energy for desalination applications. Dow et al. [14] reported a sustainable operation of a pilot DCMD system over 3 months using waste heat from a thermal power station. They obtained an average water flux of 3 kg/(m2 h) and thermal efficiency of 0.42 [14]. The low thermal efficiency obtained by Dow et al. [14] was deemed acceptable given the freely available waste heat from the power plant. Suárez et al. [16] examined a lab-scale desalination process using DCMD with low-temperature heat extracted from a salt-gradient solar pond. Their results revealed a limited thermal efficiency, with only about 35% of the heat extracted from the solar pond was utilised for the water transfer across the membrane [16]. In another study, Shim et al. [17] evaluated a DCMD system coupled with a solar thermal collector for seawater desalination application. The solar thermal collector could provide more than 77% heating energy of the DCMD process. However, because of the low process thermal efficiency, a large area of solar thermal collector (i.e. 4.7 m2) was required to power 0.06 m2 DCMD membrane module [17]. Solar thermal collectors have also been utilised to power AGMD and PGMD systems for small-scale seawater desalination application [18], [19], [20].
Computer-aided simulations can play an important role in optimising module design and process operation for a solar thermal driven MD system. Simulations of complex processes during MD operation including heat and mass transfer, temperature and concentration polarisation effects, and thermal efficiency have been reported in the literature [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. Computer software packages such as MATLAB, ANSYS Fluent, Aspen Custom Modeller, COMSOL Multiphysics, and Microsoft Excel have been successfully employed to perform MD simulations [21], [23], [24], [26], [27], [28]. However, in contrast to the many previous simulation studies on MD membrane module and system performance, very few works have attempted to simulate the integrated solar thermal driven MD process [29]. Unlike previous studies with a constant supply of energy, solar thermal is only available during the day and there is a significant temporal variation in thermal energy per square meter of collector [29], [30].
This study reported a comprehensive simulation of an integrated solar thermal driven DCMD system for small-scale seawater desalination application. First, important performance parameters including water flux, temperature polarisation effect, and thermal efficiency along the DCMD module channels under two flow modes and various operating conditions were simulated and examined. Subsequently, a solar thermal driven DCMD process, in which a solar thermal collector was coupled with the DCMD module, was simulated to demonstrate the intermittent performance of the process. The influences of operating conditions, most importantly the water cross flow velocities, on process water flux and thermal efficiency were elucidated to optimise the solar thermal seawater DCMD process. Thermal efficiency and distillate production rate of the process were analysed to elucidate the feasibility of DCMD for solar thermal driven seawater desalination. The TRNSYS, which is a transient system simulation tool [31], was used to simulate the availability of solar thermal for the MD process.
