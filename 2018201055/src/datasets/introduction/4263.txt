Machine learning is increasingly important for the development of intelligent systems in digital computers. Despite substantial advances in the field, developing machines with human-level intelligence remains a major challenge because of the fundamental differences between the two entities. In the human brain, learning is a highly complex process comprising many biological functional modules such as cells, biomolecules, and endogenous chemicals. Therefore, to bridge the gap between humans and machines, machine learning should ideally be implemented at the molecular level.
However, previous studies have reported findings regarding molecular computing (Adleman, 1994, Amir et al., 2014, Benenson et al., 2001, Brown et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2013, Mao et al., 2000, Pei et al., 2010, Qian et al., 2011, Seelig et al., 2006, Stojanovic and Stefanovic, 2003, Wang et al., 2014, Winfree et al., 1998, Yurke et al., 2000, Zhang and Kim, 2006, Zhang and Seelig, 2011), pattern classification, and associative recall (Chen et al., 2005, de Murieta and Rodríguez-Patón, 2012, Lakin et al., 2012, Lee et al., 2011a, Lee et al., 2011b, Lim et al., 2010, Lim et al., 2002, Pei et al., 2010, Qian et al., 2011, Zhang, 2008, Zhang and Jang, 2004, Zhang and Kim, 2006). Although these models have demonstrated the potential to reduce the gap between human and machines through implementation of molecules to the machine, there are some limitations, particularly the absence of learning and generalization. Learning and generalization from general training data encoded by molecules should be necessary for in vitro analysis at the molecular level because they enhance the accuracy of machines.
We have proposed the hypernetworks model (Lee et al., 2011a, Zhang, 2008, Zhang and Kim, 2006) that has a molecular evolutionary architecture based on a probabilistic graphical model for cognitive learning and memory (Zhang, 2008). The hypernetworks are based on weighted hyperedges formed by several vertices as features. It has been used for several tasks that require for human-level intelligence (Zhang, 2008). Because this model was inspired by the complex molecular networks in biological systems, machine learning can be implemented at the molecular level. In our previous study, the hypernetwork models were implemented in silico (Kim et al., 2006, Zhang and Jang, 2005), and with in vitro experimental design for learning and generalization. However, the implementation of the hypernetwork model to the wet-lab experimental setting has not yet been demonstrated.
In this study, a molecular machine was used to address learning problems involving the recognition and classification of natural language sentences, which were constructed from dialogue taken from the television shows Friends and Prison Break. In the molecular machine, learning was achieved using a type of DNA secondary structure, i.e., symmetric internal loops of double stranded DNA (dsDNA) (Cekan and Sigurdsson, 2012, Peritz et al., 1991, Zacharias and Hagerman, 1996, Zeng and Zocchi, 2006). These molecules were first trained using the full set of television show sentences with given classifications. Subsequently, learning performance was measured by calculating the percentage of correctly classified test sentences, which also consisted of sentences taken from the television shows’ dialogue, which were unknown to the molecular machine. Therefore, the molecular learning machine was designed to recognize natural language and correctly classify it according to a given question. Our results showed that the molecular learning machine was able to generalize unknown data. Indeed, a 100% success rate was observed during our 20-sentence experiments.
