The interatomic potentials between projectiles and target atoms play an important role in investigations of surface structure of crystals, e.g. surface relaxation and surface reconstruction etc., using low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) [1]. The interatomic potentials are also an important factor for studies on rainbow scattering (RS) yielding pronounced peaks in the spatial distributions of scattered projectiles with small angle under axial channeling conditions at the crystal surfaces [2], [3]. The rainbow angle θrb that is determined from the polar and azimuthal exit angles, i.e. δ and φ, respectively, corresponding to the maximum intensity of scattered projectiles in RS, depends strongly on the interatomic potential between a projectile and a target atom, where θrb = arctan(φ/δ).
Previously, Schüller and Winter (SW) [4] have obtained the dependence of rainbow angles θrb on normal energy En of projectile energy E0 to the target surface in the experimental angular distributions of scattered He, Ne and Ar atoms from the atomic rows along <11¯0> axial channeling direction at the Ag(1 1 1) surface under grazing angles of 0.5° ≤ α ≤ 2.2° with projectile energies from 3 keV to 60 keV, where α is the angle of incidence that is measured from the target surface, and En = E0 sin2 α. Takeuchi [5] have demonstrated that the ACOCT [6] simulated results using the Moliere pair potential [7] with adjustable screening length of O’Connor-Biersack (OB) [8] formula are almost in agreement with the experimental ones obtained by SW [4], where the ACOCT simulation code [6] is based on the Monte Carlo (MC) method and can simulate three-dimensionally the atomic collisions adopting the binary collision approximation (BCA) with the interatomic pair potential.
Specht et al. [9] have measured the dependence of rainbow angles θrb on normal energy En in RS of He, N, Ne and Ar atoms from the atomic rows along 〈1 0 0〉 and 〈1 1 0〉 axial channeling directions at the KCl(0 0 1) surface under grazing angles of 0.5° ≤ α ≤ 2.0° with projectile energies from 1 keV to 60 keV. In the experiments by Specht et al., to avoid the effects of image charge in the projectile trajectories, neutral projectiles have been used in the incoming and outgoing trajectories. Moreover, they [9] have analyzed the experimental results by the classical trajectory calculations as RS originating from the corrugations of equipotential planes based on averaged continuum potentials [10] over 〈1 0 0〉 and 〈1 1 0〉 atomic rows in a plane transverse to their axial channel directions. Consequently, they have revealed that the classical trajectory calculations employing the OB pair potential and the individual pair potentials calculated from Hartree-Fock (HF) wave functions [9] as the interatomic pair potential reproduce well the experimental results for RS of He, N, Ne and Ar atoms under 〈1 0 0〉 axial channeling conditions, and that the analyzed results by the classical trajectory calculations using the OB, Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) [11] and HF pair potentials are almost in agreement with the experimental data for RS of He, N and Ne atoms under 〈1 1 0〉 axial channeling conditions. To evaluate the influence of interatomic potentials on rainbow angles θrb by the simulated method of three-dimensional atomic-collisions based on BCA, being different from two-dimensional trajectory calculations for corrugated equipotential in a plane, the purpose of this paper is to analyze the dependence of θrb on En in the experimental results obtained by Specht et al. using the ACOCT code [6].
