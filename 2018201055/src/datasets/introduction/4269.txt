The human cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) are a super family of heme-containing monooxygenases that catalyze numerous oxidative reactions by a hydroxylation process. These enzymes play important roles in the metabolic activation and detoxification of a large number of exogenous and endogenous compounds (such as steroids, bile acids, fatty acids, and prostaglandins).1 Their activities can be increased or decreased by many drugs or herbs, which is a major reason for drug-drug and/or herb-drug interactions (DDIs/HDIs).
CYPs contained 57 functional genes and 58 pseudogenes, which grouped into 18 families. Among these families, CYP3A4 is the most abundant CYPs in human liver and is involved in the metabolism of about 50% of all prescribed drugs.2 Many clinically relevant DDI/HDIs involving CYP3A4 are due to mechanism-based inhibition (MBI) consequent to metabolism of the inhibitor to a reactive intermediate (RM) that binds irreversibly or quasi-irreversibly to the enzyme.3 These DDI/HDIs caused by MBI are persistent since they require synthesis of new enzyme for recovery, and the MBI is generally thought to have a greater effect than reversible inhibition does.
Computational approaches have been extensively employed towards the understanding and predicting the possibilities of ligand-CYPs interactions. The major computational methods include simple rule-based modelling, structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis, three-dimensional QSAR analysis, pharmacophore, molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and homology modelling studies,4 and these methods will help us significantly reduce the number of potential false positive hypotheses, decrease the running times of the experiments, and it also can better understand oxidative reactions catalyzed by CYPs and predict possible DDIs/HDIs, pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance, and drug toxicity.5 There are a few computational methods, including pharmacokinetic modelling,3 pharmacophore model6 and quantitative structure activity studies,7 that have been extensively employed towards understanding and predicting the possibilities of CYP3A4 inhibition, but few papers until now are focused on studying and predicting the possibilities of CYP3A4 mechanism-based inhibition with computational methods.
The research on pharmacophore is one of the popular subjects in the field of life science. Pharmacophore is the spacial arrangement of key chemical features that are recognized by a receptor and are thus responsible for ligand-receptor binding. Once such a pharmacophore model has been derived, it can be used to search for other molecular that contain the same pharmacophore which might be also active. In recent years, the combination of multiple virtual screening approaches have become the main research direction of computer-aided drug design. Molecular docking, as one of major computational methods, could offer more insight into understanding the protein-ligand interactions and the structural features of active site of protein, which further predicted possible DDI/HDI.8 A combination of pharmacophore model (the virtual screening method based on ligands) and molecular docking (the virtual screening method based on receptor) approaches would improve the accuracy of the pharmacophore model screening singly, and it also better understand the nature of binding and the structural features that play a significant role in the binding of ligands to CYPs, which might be a useful tool to identify potential mechanism-based inhibitors of CYPs from herbal medicines. In this study, a combination of computational approaches including pharmacophore model together with molecular docking are used to rapidly virtual screen the potential CYP3A4 mechanism-based inhibitors from Tripterygium wilfordii, and in vitro experiments are conducted to validate the computational data.
Tripterygium wilfordii, as a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used in the treatment of immune-related diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic nephritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.9 Despite its desirable benefits, there is an increasing awareness about the potential adverse effects of Tripterygium wilfordii, including severe hepato-, nephro-, immuno-, developmental, and reproductive toxicities.10 Tripterygium wilfordii has been documented to contain more than 100 components, including diterpenes, triterpenes, glycosides, and alkaloids.11 Studies have shown that some components of Tripterygium wilfordii were CYP3A4 inhibitors including triptolide12 and celastrol,13 and CYP3A4 was an important CYPs involved in the metabolism and detoxify of Tripterygium wilfordii. Our studies explored the possibility of studying the binding mode of ligands with CYP3A4 using pharmacophore model together with molecular docking. These results can be of predicting the probability of HDIs, providing references for correlation studies and decrease the risk of Tripterygium wilfordii use.
