Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is using computers and software to interpret medical information. The purpose of CAD is to improve the diagnosis accuracy. In fact, CAD is used as a second opinion by the physicians to make the final diagnosis decision [1], [2].
Nowadays, CAD is used in many different fields in medicine including, but not limited to, early detection of breast cancer [3], lung cancer diagnosis [4], arrhythmia detection [5] and dental and maxillofacial lesions diagnosis [6]. Several studies have been reported in the literature focusing on the application of CAD for cancer diagnosis and prognosis [7], [8].
Cancer is a collection of diseases that involves growing abnormal cells with the potential to spread to other parts of the body [9]. There are over 200 types of cancer. The most common types of cancer in women are breast, colorectal, lung, and cervical [10].
Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for 8.2 million deaths in 2012 [11]. The most common causes of cancer death are: lung (1.59 million deaths), liver (745,000), stomach (723,000), colorectal (694,000), breast (521,000), and esophageal (400,000) [11]. More than 60% of world's total new annual cancer cases occur in Africa, and Central and South America [12]. The cancer incidence in Asia is also high [13]. It is expected that annual cancer cases will rise from 14 million in 2012 to 22 million within the next 2 decades [11], [12]. Worthwhile, among all types of cancer, breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women [14].
In Iran, cancer is the third cause of death after coronary heart disease, and accidents [15]. Breast cancer is the leading type of cancer in Iranian females, accounting for 24.6% of all cancers. In Iran, the average women age with breast cancer is 49.6 years [16]. Among all of the provinces in Iran, Isfahan Province is the biggest and most important area located at a desert border in the center of Iran [17]. The rate of cancer is increasing rapidly in Isfahan Province. Cancer control and comprehensive prevention plan is thus necessary [18].
Breast cancer, a complex heterogeneous disease, occurs with a set of different clinical symptoms. It is usually diagnosed using blood tests, MRI, mammography, and CT scan and biopsy. The pathology results from biopsy samples indicate whether the suspicious area is cancerous. Cancer patients, then, undergo a systematic treatment procedure dependent on the cancer stage and additional lab tests such as hormone receptor status [19].
Cancer staging (assigning an ordinal numbers I–IV) is in fact the process to determine the extent to which a cancer has been spread and is based on the following four characteristics: 1) the tumor size, 2) whether the cancer is invasive or non-invasive, 3) the spread of the tumor into the lymph nodes, and 4) the spread of the tumor into other parts of the body (i.e. metastasis). Stage I is an isolated cancer (tumor size ≤ 20 mm in greatest dimension) while stage IV is a metastasis cancer. Most cancer deaths are due to cancer that has spread from its primary site to other organs [12], [20].
Breast cancer is usually treated with surgery, which may be followed by chemotherapy, radiation, and hormone therapies [21]. When the cancer patient is initially treated, the disease can recur at any time. However, most recurrences happen in the first 5 years after treatment [22]. The recurrence could be local (near the mastectomy scar), regional (spread to nearby lymph nodes) or metastatic (spread to other parts of the body not near the breast). Some of the most common sites of recurrence outside the breast are the lymph nodes, bones, liver, lungs, and brain [23].
An important issue is whether we can optimize the treatments to increase the therapeutic efficacy. In fact, 5-year recurrence-free survival is an important treatment quality measure. In principle, it is possible to predict 5-year cancer recurrence using clinicopathologic characteristics of cancer patients [24]. Such a prediction could be used by doctors to make proper treatment plan to considerably prolong patient life [25].
The prediction systems were used for cancer diagnosis in the literature [7]. However, there are few studies focusing on cancer prognosis (including recurrence or survival analysis). Since the focus of the current study is prediction of cancer recurrence, the literature review on cancer recurrence prediction models is provided. Meanwhile, the table of available methods was provided in the Supplementary material S1.
Zeng suggested a mixture classification model containing a two-layer structure called mixture of rough set and support vector machine (SVM) for breast cancer prognosis with the average accuracy of 91% [26].
The Nottingham prognostic index (NPI) is a prognostic regression model proposed by Galea et al. [27] based on tumor size, histological grade, and lymph node status. The NPI calculation equation is as follows: tumor size (cm) × 0.2 + histological grade + lymph node point (negative nodes = 1; 1–3 positive nodes = 2; ≥ 4 positive nodes = 3). The patients were then classified into the low-risk (NPI point < 3.4) and high-risk groups (NPI point ≥ 3.4) [27], [28].
Kim et al. [28] used normalized mutual information index for feature selection and supported vector machines (SVM), Cox-proportional hazard regression model, and artificial neural network classifiers for classification in a sample size of 679 patients (the recurrence prevalence of 28.6%). The following features were used in their prognosis system: local invasion of tumor, number of tumors, number of metastatic lymph nodes, the histological grade, tumor size, estrogen receptor, and lymphovascular invasion and reached the sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve of 89%, 73% and 0.85, respectively for the best classifier (SVM). Although the statistical power of their system is acceptable (Power = 89% > 80%), the Type I error is beyond the acceptable range (α = 0.17 > 0.05).
Ahmad et al. [29] used the SVM, decision tree, and multilayer perceptron artificial neural network classifiers with feature selection in a sample size of 547 patients (the recurrence prevalence of 21.4%). The predictors were age at diagnosis, menarche and menopause, tumor size, number of involved and dissected axially lymph nodes, grade and HER2. The best classifier (SVM) had sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 96%, 91% and 94%, respectively. Despite the high performance of the algorithm proposed by the authors, cases with primary metastasis, a metastasis diagnosed at the time of registry, were not excluded from the analysis. In fact, having metastasis was one of the attributes primarily used by their proposed system. This necessary exclusion has been implemented in similar studies [28], [30]. The reason for such an exclusion is that the survival rate of patients with stage IV (metastasis) breast cancer within 5 years is about 10% to 15%. Thus, most of patients with primary metastasis experience cancer recurrence.
The discriminative prognosis predictors vary regionally in different studies [27], [28], [29]. Also, such prognosis tools have been recently used to optimize the treatment protocol. An example is including the cancer recurrence risk to breast cancer treatment guidelines by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN). Thus, there is a need to design prognosis tools in regions that are different based on cancer epidemiology. Meanwhile, it is necessary to validate the cancer prognosis system using extensive diagnosis validation criteria. Therefore, the aim of this study was to reliably and accurately predict breast cancer recurrence using pathological and demographics features of the patients. In the proposed CAD system, HPBCR (hybrid predictor of breast cancer recurrence), a hybrid technique including statistical features selection, meta-heuristic population-based optimization and ensemble learning were used to predict breast cancer recurrence in the first 5 years after the diagnosis.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section, information about the experimental protocol and the pattern recognition methods used in this study is presented. Section 3 provides the results of HPBCR and its comparison with the state-of-the-art. The discussion is provided in Section 4 and finally, the conclusions are summarized in Section 5.
