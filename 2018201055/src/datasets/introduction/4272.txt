Currently Ca-Si containing materials are extensively used in various industries, construction and medicine as bioactive ceramic materials (Reséndiz-Hernández et al., 2014a, Zhang et al., 2010, Zuleta et al., 2011, Reséndiz-Hernández et al., 2014b, Razavi et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2015, Gerasimova and Tyukavkina, 2015). Practical application of these materials significantly depends on particle size, defects and an amorphous phase on the surfaces of the crystallites. Changes of the lengths and angles of interatomic bonds lead to changes in the atoms coordination and phase transitions with the formation of the phases with composition different from that of the initial material. Their properties depend on the method and conditions of preparation. Methods of ultrafine grinding and mechanical activation are the most common ones. Thus, the focus of the condensed matter physics is the development of methods that allow characterizing the structure of ultrafine materials (Tsybuly and Yatsenko, 2012, Pakharukova et al., 2017).
The information about the structural state of the mechanically activated materials in various environments and crushed to nanoscale particles can be obtained at the atomic level using diffraction methods. Ultrafine materials are isotropic1 and therefore their diffraction patterns are isotropic too. Consequently, the three-dimensional atoms arrangement in the short-range order regions can be reconstructed using only computer simulation techniques. It was shown that molecular dynamic simulation and a model of mechanical mixture are good tools for studying the organization of mechanically activated silicon and calcium containing materials (Lobov et al., 2005, Prokhorskii et al., 2004). The purpose of this work was construction of three-dimensional models of the atomic arrangement in a short-range order region of mechanically activated pseudowollastonite based on XRD data.
