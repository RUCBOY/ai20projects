Amines play important role in industrial [1], [2], [3] and pharmacological [4], [5] applications, but also in biological processes [6], [7], [8], [9]. They bear an interesting resemblance with mono-ols in that they form hydrogen bonds through the lone pairs of the nitrogen atom. Since alcohols form micro-heterogeneous mixtures with water [10], one equally expects amines to behave similarly. However, the NH group of amines has a 2 donor - 1 acceptor, instead of the 1 donor -1 acceptor structure of OH hydroxyl group of linear alcohols. How does this difference affects the micro-structure of neat amines and aqueous amine mixtures? For example, it is well known that linear alcohols form chain-like cluster structures, which produce a pre-peak in the oxygen-oxygen structure factor and the total scattered intensity as seen through neutron or X-ray diffraction experiments [11], [12]. The existence of two donor sites for amines would favour branched chains. How this particularity could affect amines, as compared to linear mono-ols? Lower amines such as methylamine and ethylamine are gases under ambient conditions, while methanol and ethanol are liquid. This fact indicates that, despite their double hydrogen bonding structure, amines have less hydrogen bonding capabilities than the corresponding mono-ols. In order to appreciate this difference, it is instructive to look at the classical force field representation of the hydrogen bonding through their Coulomb contributions as partial charges on the oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen atoms. The Optimized Potential for Liquid Simulation (OPLS) [13] force field attributes for propylamine the valence zN = −0.9 to the nitrogen atom and valence zH = +0.360 to the hydrogen atom. Similarly, it attributes for 1propanol the valence zO = −0.7 to the oxygen atom and the valence zH = +0.435. Both sets of values are about the same order of magnitude. Therefore, it seems reasonable to consider that it is the topology of the amidogen NH2 group of the amine molecules which does not allow as much hydrogen bonding as the hydroxyl OH group of the alcohol molecules. In particular, the proximity of the two hydrogen atoms next the nitrogen atom may hinder efficient hydrogen bonding. This fact may have its importance in the cluster formation and micro-heterogeneous domain formation under mixing conditions. For example, it is experimentally known that aqueous amine mixtures tend to have a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) [14]. This is in variance with aqueous mixtures of small alcohols, which generally tend to have an upper critical solution temperature under ambient pressure conditions, such as aqueous 1butanol (at 397.9 K [15]) and 2butanol (at 390.35 K [16]), for example. It is tempting to associate this difference between the two types of mixtures to the underlying topological properties of the two types of solute molecules. For example, in terms of the degree of hydrogen bonding, alcohols may tend to form a more coherently bonded liquid than amines, under ambient conditions, which could explain the temperature dependance of the way these liquids mix with water. In this context, it is interesting to ask how this difference would affect the type of micro-heterogeneity these mixtures have.
Amines have not been studied by computer simulation as much as alcohols, as can be seen by the scarcely available force fields [17], other than the usual Gromos [18], [19] and OPLS [20], [21] transferable force fields. Kusalik et al. [22] have studied methylamine and aqueous methylamine. Lachet et al. [17] have studied a large variety of alkanolamines and their aqueous mixtures, and have proposed a new force field in order to obtain better excess enthalpies.
The principal objective of this paper is to use our previous studies about micro-heterogeneity to explore for the first time the micro-heterogeneous structure of both neat and aqueous propylamine. This study is a continuation of previous studies where we have shown that the structure of the solute molecule greatly affects the way water segregated domain forms. For example, in aqueous alcohols, water tends to form bulky domains [23], [24]. In aqueous DMSO, water forms chain-like cluster domains [25]. In both cases, the existence of such segregated domains has two distinct type of impact on the structural and thermodynamical properties of such mixtures. Firstly, a domain pre-peak is found in the oxygen-oxygen structure factor SOO(k) at a k-vector intermediate between k = 0 and the main peak about k = 2π/σw ≈ 2 Å −1, the latter which corresponds to the diameter of the water molecule σw ≈ 3.1 Å. The exact position of this peak, as well as its height, depends on the bulkiness of the segregated water domains. Secondly, the concentration fluctuations depend on the nature of the domains, and tend to be rather high for domain that are fuzzy (such as in tbutanol-water) or with large polydispersity (such as in benzene-ethanol), and small for domains with well stabilized shapes (such as aqueous-DMSO) [26]. Concentration fluctuations, defined as Cij = <NiNj > − < Ni > <Nj >, where Ni is the number of molecules of species i in a given volume V, are related to the structure factors Sij(k = 0) through the relation [27](1)Sij(k=0)=<NiNj>−<Ni><Nj><Ni><Nj>
In a recent work [28], we have argued that segregated water domains were made of groups of smaller water clusters, the latter which were the elementary entity behind micro-segregation. This way of looking at micro-segregation opens new perspectives with respect to general physical chemistry, mainly for a new interpretation of phenomena such as, for example, the hydrophobic effect [29], [30], [31], [32], as well as the role of water in the biophysical context [33], [34]. The way water forms clusters and the way these clusters group themselves into larger domains or not, seems to depend very strongly on the nature of the solute [26]. For these reasons, it is interesting to explore particular solutes, in order to understand the common mechanism behind the behaviour of water. We have chosen propylamine since it is miscible with water at all proportions, and lower alkylamines are less miscible.
In the present paper, we will adopt the same type of approach that we have considered in our previous ones, namely with respect to force fields. While it is important to represent force fields properly in order to reproduce best target physico-chemical properties, we adopt the view that these considerations do not affect qualitatively the micro-segregation property of corresponding aqueous mixtures. In other words, while peculiar details of micro-heterogeneity, such as the pre-peak height and position, for example, might be as sensitive to force field details as other physical properties such as excess enthalpy or density, for example, its existence is essentially robust to such details. This approach has been particularly successful in allowing to predict the correct experimental Kirkwood-Buff integrals (KBI), despite strong differences in the short range correlations corresponding to different force fields, for example in the case of aqueous tbutanol [23] and aqueous acetone [35]. This is an important consideration since the KBI are expressed in terms of volumetric quantities as well as chemical potential derivatives, which are all sensitive to force field details. Since the KBI are representative of the nature of concentration fluctuations, these findings imply an interesting universality relationship between the robustness local molecular organisation, such as clustering or micro-segregation, and force field details.
