A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a technology that uses neurophysiological signals from the brain, enabling communication and environmental control without muscle movement (Wolpaw et al., 2002, Birbaumer and Cohen, 2007). There are two types of BCIs: invasive and noninvasive. An invasive BCI uses unit recording or electrocorticography, which requires neurosurgery (Leuthardt et al., 2004, Hochberg et al., 2006). A noninvasive BCI uses electroencephalography (EEG) signals recorded from scalp electrodes: slow cortical potentials, sensorimotor rhythms, steady-state visually evoked potentials, and P300 event-related potentials (ERPs) have been proposed and used (Birbaumer et al., 1999, Donchin et al., 2000, McFarland and Wolpaw, 2005, Sakurada et al., 2015).
One popular noninvasive BCI is a P300-based system. The P300’s responses to random rare stimuli (e.g., oddball paradigm) are attention-related EEG signals and elicited as a positive potential, occurring ∼300 ms after stimulus onset (Sutton et al., 1965, Polich, 2007). Farwell and Donchin (1988) originally developed a P300 speller using this response, induced by a visual oddball paradigm that demanded a choice of randomly flashing icons arranged in the rows and columns of a 6 × 6 matrix. In addition to the visual P300-BCI paradigm, P300-BCI paradigms using auditory or tactile stimuli have been applied; however, the accuracy using auditory or tactile P300-BCI spellers is usually lower than that with visual P300-BCI spellers (Riccio et al., 2012).
BCI technology has been applied to patients with severe motor disabilities, such as those with spinal cord injuries (Ikegami et al., 2011), brainstem strokes (Sellers et al., 2014), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Several research groups have reported clinical experiments in patients with ALS, and reliable performance has been reported (Piccione et al., 2006; Sellers and Donchin, 2006; Hoffmann et al., 2008, Nijboer et al., 2008, Silvoni et al., 2009, McCane et al., 2015). Our research group developed a region-based, two-step P300 speller, which has a larger flashing area than the conventional visual array, and showed that the two-step procedure provided significantly increased accuracy when compared with a conventional row/column speller for patients with ALS (Ikegami et al., 2014). The two-step procedure may also be useful for other patients with neurodegenerative diseases who are potential users of the BCI speller.
Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), a neurodegenerative disease, is autosomal dominant and is often accompanied by severe cerebellar impairments (Matsuda et al., 2014, Yasui et al., 2014). Patients with SCA exhibit various slowly progressive symptoms, such as incoordination of gait and hands, speech disorders, and impaired oculomotor control. The patients often show deterioration in their activities of daily living (ADL) (Harding, 1982, D’Abreu et al., 2010, Yasui et al., 2014, Jacobi et al., 2015, Park et al., 2015) and often have difficulty with purposeful movements, such as typing and writing and speaking over the phone because of scanning speech disorders. With disease progression, these patients might potentially have difficulty using augmentative and alternative communication devices. Therefore, patients with severe SCA may be candidates for the use of BCI technologies.
In this study, we applied a region-based, two-step P300 speller to eight patients with SCA who needed some ADL assistance. We showed that patients with SCA could use the two-step P300 speller successfully.
