Deontic logic is the logic of deontic modalities, such as obligation, permission, and prohibition. It has been used since the 1950s as a formal instrument for modeling normative reasoning [39]. Deontic logic has been studied in several research areas, including philosophy, linguistics, and computer science; for a recent survey, we address the reader to [8]. Many logical formalisms have been proposed to model deontic statements. This paper focuses on input/output logic, which has been originally introduced in [18].
Input/output logic has been proposed with the aim of providing “a theoretical framework for the use of norms and normative reasoning in applications in computer science, law, linguistics, ethics, and other domains” ([8], pp. 501–502).
The key peculiarity of input/output is its norm-based semantics, in the sense of [13]. Specifically, as it will be explained below in section 2, input/output logic adopts a kind of norm-based semantics termed operational semantics: an input/output system is conceived as a deductive machine, like a black box which produces deontic statements as output, when we feed it factual statements as input.
Deontic frameworks grounded on norm-based semantics have been proposed as an alternative to standard deontic frameworks grounded on possible-world semantics, such as STIT logic [14] and dynamic deontic logic [22], [37]. Two main motivations are assumed to justify such an alternative semantics:
1.Philosophically, it is widely acknowledged that there is a distinction between norms on the one hand, and declarative statements on the other. Declarative statements may have truth-values, which means they are capable of being true or false; but norms are not. They may be complied or violated. But it makes no sense to describe norms as true or as false. Hence, it seems there cannot be a logic of norms: this is the well-known Jørgensen's dilemma [17].In input/output logic conditional norms do not bear truth values. They are not embedded in compound formulae using truth-functional connectives. To keep clear of all confusion, norms are not even treated as formulae, but simply as ordered pairs (a,x) of logical formulae. If (a,x) is a mandatory norm, then it is read as “given a, x is obligatory”. If it is a permissive norm, then it is read as “given a, x is permitted”. Input/output logic aims at solving Jørgensen's dilemma at its starting line (cf. also [21]).2.Norm-based semantics appears to offer a straightforward and simple way to deal with moral conflicts, i.e. situations when an agent ought to perform two or more actions but he cannot perform them all in that they conflict with each other (cf. [15]). For instance, suppose an agent both ought to make an expensive present to a friend and ought to save money to pay the rent. A standard way to deal with them in norm-based semantics is extending the basic formalism with priorities on norms in order to rank them according to certain preference criteria. In input/output logic, such a solution has been proposed in [23], which develops an extension of [18]'s basic definitions with prioritized norms in order to handle moral conflicts.
