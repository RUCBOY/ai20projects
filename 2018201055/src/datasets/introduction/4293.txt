In the course of various scientific and engineering research studies, large and oftentimes extremely time-consuming simulation models are employed for analysis, comparisons and decision making processes. In order to reduce computational costs associated with such complex simulations, surrogate models are often utilized as viable alternatives to actual simulation models [1]. Surrogate models are constructed by identifying locations within the design space where simulations will be conducted  [2]. This process of identifying locations within the design space is known as design of experiments (DOE). Latin hypercube Design (LHD), is one of the most popular DOE techniques, and was first proposed by McKay et al. in 1979 [1]. Since its initial proposal, LHD has received high levels of attention within the field of DOE, particularly due to its availability and minimal restrictions on number of factors and sampling budget [3], [4]. In practice, LHDs are often applied in a simultaneous approach towards screening large number of factors for significance and for fitting complex surrogate models to a handful of dominant variables [5]. A typical n×k LHD can be represented by a design matrix Xn×k having n rows (runs) and k columns (factors), in which each column represents a permutation of n uniformly spaced levels.
By virtue of definition, LHDs possess the property of projective uniformity with regardto each factor individually, yet, other desirable properties, such as space-filling property [6], [7], or column-wise orthogonality [8], which allows independent estimation of model parameters may vary considerably within the class of LHDs of a given size, thus making some designs more suitable in practice than others  [4]. Optimizing a point location within LHDs to improve space-filling property of such point distribution is quite challenging, as documented in a number of research studies [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. A summary extract showing various approaches utilized for constructing optimal space-filling Latin hypercube design is shown in Table 1.
Such designs [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21] are usually obtained from time consuming optimization tasks as listed in Table 1, and comprising search space of the order of (n!)k−1. For example, to optimize the location of 20 samples in 2 dimensions, the algorithm locates a best design from more than 1036 possible designs. If the dimensionality of variables is increased to 3, the number of possible designs becomes more than 1055.Table 1.

However, implementing an optimization with respect to either of these additional properties does not necessarily produce the best LHD with regard to other properties. It is generally believed that a good LHD should be a space-filling design as well as an orthogonal design [22]. One feasible solution is employing optimization methods towards producing LHDs that possess both desirable properties  [18], [23], [24]. However, there exist difficulties in generating such designs and the optimization process results in a computationally expensive process which is oftentimes not reliable for more complex designs. Based on such expected challenges, Ye’s method  [25] and its extended versions by Cioppa [22] and Sun  [26], proposed an initial construction of a class of orthogonal Latin hypercube designs (OLHDs), after which optimization is further applied to enable better space-filling suitability within the subclass of OLHDs. Comparison between Ye’s [25] method and its extended versions by Cioppa  [22] and Sun  [26] is listed in Table 2.
For most practical computer experiments, the exact adequate number of sampling points required to produce a desirable performance cannot be determined in advance, and thus the ability to extend or refine an experimental design becomes a requisite [27]. Therefore, the sequential design of experiments remained an important topic during past and recent decades [22], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. These methods often start with a low level LHD, and new levels are filled within gaps of existing points when the low level LHD is unable to attain satisfactory performance. Tong  [27], Sallaberry et al. [28], and Vorechovsky  [29] proposed methods commonly regarded as hierarchical, and further extended the LHDs, where given an LHD of dimension n, each level is further divided into levels containing the original level and extended levels, where t is the refinement factor. Due to randomness of these extension processes, the space-filling performance may be poor. Shields et al. [30], [31] improved these methods by adding one point at a time, which improves the space-filling performance and eliminates exponential increase of sampling points.Table 2.

Based on above-mentioned methods, this research proposes a new approach towards constructing LHDs not only possessing the same factors as Sun’s method for the same levels, but also possessing favorable properties of near-orthogonality and optimized space-filling attributes. Moreover, in cases where LHD levels are not enough to fit a desirable surrogate model, a sequentially enlarging strategy is proposed to run a follow-up experiment with additional levels elaborately chosen to form a larger LHD combining with the initial levels.
The outline of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 elaborates and clarifies detailed procedures of the proposed LHD construction method. In Section 3, a series of numerical examples are illustrated in order to validate effectiveness of the proposed method. Section 4 illustrates two mechanical applications of the proposed method, while the final section summarizes this research and result findings.
