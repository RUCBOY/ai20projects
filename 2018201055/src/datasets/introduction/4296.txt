The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is a promising candidate for clean and efficient power generation in this century. The advantages of fuel cells compared with traditional power generators are as follows: higher efficiency, no existence of the mobile parts and lack of sonic pollution. The polymer membrane is a key component of fuel cell system that separates fuel and oxidant and transports protons from anode side to cathode side [1], [2]. From molecular point of view, the proton transport in hydrated polymeric model belongs to “proton hopping” (or “Grotthus mechanism”) and “diffusion mechanism” which water as vehicle (or “vehicular mechanism”) [3], [4], [5]. With the development of extremely advanced computer technology over the past several decades, computational methods of analysis have become an important source of information on the chemical-physical properties of polymers. Molecular simulations have been applied to enhance the understanding of chemical structures and interactions on the molecular level [6], [7]. Many different membrane materials have been studied and developed to improve the proton conductivity, thermal and chemical stability, such systems were focused on the proton conductivity and its dependence on temperature and humidity [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Jiao et al. [13] they develop the 3D model of exchange membrane fuel cell and found that the PEM fuel cell performance is generally improved with more humidification of anode, but the improvement becomes less significant at higher humidification levels. J. Benzigr et al. [14] found the rate of limiting water self-diffusivity increases exponentially at water content λ = 1–4. Urata et al. [15] theoretically modeled such system of hydrated Nafion at λ = 2.8, 5.9, 13.3 and 35.4. They concluded that the sulfonic acid groups are the only sits of the polymer to which water molecules bind in the pendant chain. Jang et al. [16] used MD simulation to investigate hydrated Nafion at λ = 16. The result showed n water transport depending on the structure of Nafion chain. Lei Chen et al. [17] carried out MD calculation for Nafion 117 Membrane with different water content at 300 K and 353 K. They found that, at the same temperature, the diffusion coefficients of both water molecules and hydroniums increase with the water content, afterward they experimental and numerical study on thermal conductivity of proton exchange membrane, they report the water content and temperature are important factors affecting thermal conductivities for PEM [18]. Spohr et al. [19] studied the electronic effect on proton transfer of the polymer chains. They concluded that proton mobility depending on the electronic charge distribution around the pendant side chains. Venkatnathan et al. [20] studied hydrated and temperature effects on the mobility of hydronium ion. They found that the diffusion coefficient for the hydronium ion was much smaller than that for water, and temperature had a significant effect on the diffusion coefficients for both water and hydronium ions. Sun et al. [21] studied the mechanism of proton transfer, they found that the proton transfer process effects by the water content and water bridge for proton transfer from one sulfonic acid group to its adjacent sulfonic acid group. Chi et al. [22] compared experimental and MD simulation results to investigate the phase separation and water channel formation in Nafion and PEEK membranes; they observed percolation behavior and explained the proton transport as being the result of proton hopping and the vehicle mechanism. Deuk et al. [23] used MD simulations to investigate the ion transport properties in the PEEK ion exchange membrane, and found that the calculated mean squared displacement of the hydronium ion and the hydroxide conductivity were consistent with the values reported for experimental results. In spite of these valuable experimental and theoretical studies, the detailed mechanism of proton transport in hydrated Nafion is still unclear. Literature suggested mechanisms for proton transport including vehicular and Grotthuss. However, these mechanisms are still not verified. The present work analyzed proton movement from MD trajectories. The mechanism of proton transport can then be clarified.
