As the main inorganic component of a hard tissue, calcium phosphate (Ca-P) bioceramics, have excellent bioactivity and good capability in osteoconduction/osteoinduction [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], and have been widely adopted in bone repair or orthopedic application. The main format of calcium phosphate in the body is found to be imperfect nano hydroxyapatite (HA) [7], [8], which is the result of the regulation of proteins and other biological factors. When Ca-P bioceramics are implanted into a living body, proteins from the surrounding body fluids will be spontaneously adsorbed onto their surfaces, followed by the cellular attachment, proliferation and migration. Thus, it’s well known that protein adsorption plays an important role in the determination of Ca-P biological properties. Lots of studies about the protein adsorption behaviors have been done to better understand the mechanism of protein adsorptions and the reasons that Ca-P bioceramics have excellent biological properties. In these decades, many approaches utilizing biological, physical-chemical, or the combined methodologies have been wildly adopted in the research of protein adsorption on materials.
Many factors have been found to affect protein absorption behaviors. For example, the effect of different material properties, like the chemical components and surface properties; the effect of different protein properties and environments, such as the pH value of protein solutions, the acidity/basicity or electric charge of proteins and the conformation change of protein upon the adsorption onto the surface [9]. Furthermore, Dee et al. [10] has shown the main properties of proteins and materials surfaces can affect protein adsorption. Together, these studies have greatly extended our knowledge of proteins adsorption on Ca-P. However, bone formation is a complex process which must involve the dissolution and precipitation of calcium phosphate ions. Our current knowledge is still limited in understanding the mechanism of adsorption behaviors at the atomic/molecular level, especially the role of calcium phosphate ions played in the proteins adsorption.
Computer simulation is now becoming to a basic method for materials genome research [11], which provides an alternative way to study the interfacial interactions between Ca-Ps and proteins at an atomic/molecular level. It has been adopted to investigate interactions between proteins and HA; the most widely used bioceramic materials, after the force field parameters of HA were available for molecular dynamic (MD) simulation [12]. Wu et al. [13], [14] employed an MD method to investigate the interactions between bone morphogenetic protein – 7 (BMP-7) and the HA (001) surface. They also studied the interaction energy and adsorption groups/sites between Fibronectin-III and HA (001) in order to study the adsorption and desorption behavior of proteins. Bhowmik et al. [15] used the MD method to investigate the HA (001), (100), (010) and polyacrylic acid interfacial actions. Pan HH et al. [16] studied the adsorption processes of Gly and Glu residues on the HA (001) and (100) surfaces. The simulation results of their studies demonstrated that computer simulations is an efficient method to study the protein adsorption behaviors at an atomic level. In these studies, acidic proteins or residues were mostly used as model proteins because most of the bone-related proteins are acidic proteins that are believed to play a key role in the biomineralization [17], [18]. However, as control models, basic proteins are rarely investigated in computer simulations, although the studying of basic proteins may provide us with more information about the protein-CaP interactions. Meanwhile, (001) and (100) planes of HA were most adopted as the model substrates in previous literatures. It should be noted that (110) plane of HA is the most favorite plane in its crystal according to lots of experimental results [19], [20], [21]. (110) and (010) plane may play more important role in the investigation of protein adsorption behavior on HA; for instance, Almora-Barrios et al. [22] indicated that Hyp-Pro-Gly peptide in collagen interacted primarily with HA (110) rather than HA (001) plane. Quantum mechanics were also adopted to investigate the micro-molecules adsorption on HA. Chiatti et al. found that non-stoichiometric HA(010) surfaces which contain A type P-rich and B-type Ca-rich models are more stable than the stoichiometric one[23]. Rimola et al. investigated peptide folding on HA (001) and (010) [24]. Single residues were commonly chosen as a model, to calculate the electron structure, binding type/energy and etc., which provided detailed information about the adsorption sites [25], [26], [27], [28].
In this study, MD simulations of proteins adsorption on HA (001), (100), (110), (010) surfaces in Calcium phosphate solution were performed. A typical acidic protein human albumin serum (HSA) was chosen as the target protein since it is plentiful in body fluids and tissues, and participates in the osteoinductive process of HA in vivo. [29], [30] A typical basic protein lysozyme (LSZ); a part of the innate immune system, was adopted as control. The adsorption behavior of these two protein on the three HA surfaces, and the effect of Calcium and phosphate ions on the adsorption process were investigated based on the analysis results of interaction energy and adsorption sites. It is expected to provide detailed information about the protein adsorption behaviors, even as the prospective study of biomaterials genome research, and help to interpret the mechanism of bioactivity and osteoinduction of Ca-P bioceramics at the atomic/molecular level.
