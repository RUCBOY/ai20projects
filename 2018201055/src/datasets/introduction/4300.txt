On 21 January 1844, the English mathematician Augustus De Morgan wrote a confidential letter to Lady Noel Byron about her 28-year-old daughter, Augusta Ada King, the Countess of Lovelace, who De Morgan had tutored as a private pupil in various areas of advanced mathematics for about eighteen months in the early 1840s. In his letter, while he was at pains to stress that “I have never expressed to Lady Lovelace my opinion of her as a student of these matters” [i.e. mathematics], De Morgan wrote: 
I feel bound to tell you that the power of thinking on these matters which Lady L[ovelace] has always shewn from the beginning of my correspondence with her, has been something so utterly out of the common way for any beginner, man or woman, that this power must be duly considered by her friends, with reference to the question whether they should urge or check her obvious determination to try not only to reach but to get beyond, the present bounds of knowledge.1
