Pioneering and comprehensive work in the area of minimax designs includes Elfving [1]. He uses minimax designs, that is, E-optimal designs, aiming to minimize the maximum of the variances of any unitary linear combination of the parameters. Dette, Heiligers and Studden [2] generalized the minimax criterion to any norm over a euclidean space [2]. The MV-optimal criterion considers the ℓ1-norm, therefore it minimizes the largest of the variances of the parameter estimates of the model. MV-optimality is a potentially difficult, but meaningful, criterion because of its nondifferentiability at equal variance (EV) designs. Ford [3] proved some general results for this criterion, specifically, he found the directional derivative, a key tool for checking the MV-optimality of a design. Later Jacroux [4] called it MV-optimality and used it for block designs. López-Fidalgo [5] determined the gradient of this criterion function on a partition of the information matrix space, specifically, in the regions where the criterion function is differentiable. Dette [6] further considered a minimax criterion of standardized variances. Uddin [7] computed MV-optimal block designs when observations within each block are correlated. Hedayat and Yang [8] and Hedayat and Zheng [9] used MV-optimality as a convenient criterion for comparing test treatments with a control treatment using crossover designs and provided sufficient conditions for a crossover design to be simultaneously A-optimal and MV-optimal. Yan and Locke [10] generalized these results to the situation in which subject effects are assumed to be random. Kounias and Chalikias [11] used MV-optimal repeated measurement designs when a treatment–period interaction exists.
Binary response models are of much interest in a variety of areas, where optimal designs have been computed. From optimal experimental design theory, these nonlinear models can be seen as weighted linear regression models when the square root of the weight function has a finite integral ([12], [13], Proposition 5.1). Thus, we consider the problem of finding minimax designs for a weighted linear regression model. Much of the research on binary regression models has been focused on D-optimality for the Logistic model. The Probit model has also been figured and a few results have been given for the Double Exponential, Double Reciprocal, complementary Log–Log or skewed Logit models [14]. Myers, Myers and Carter [15] focused on the average prediction variance for the Logistic model. Sitter and Torsney [16] considered two variables for Logit and Probit models and gave D- and c-optimal designs. As is well known, these models are nonlinear, so the information matrix depends on the parameters. Some authors have considered sequential designs as a solution to this problem of parameter dependence [17], [18]. Some other authors have used a Bayesian approach [19], [20], [21]. Scazzero and Ord [22] computed D-optimal designs for the Logistic model with restrictions on the design weights. Burridge and Sebastiani [23] provided D-efficient designs not depending on the parameters. Haines [24] showed a geometric framework for computing Bayesian and minimax designs for the logistic models with known slope and Agin and Chalonr [21] gave an analytical approach to the problem introduced by Haines [24] comparing the results. King and Wong [25] introduced a new criterion minimizing the largest determinant of the inverse of the information matrix on the parametric space and provided an algorithm for the Logistic model. Mathew and Sinha [26] optimized some functions of the parameters for the Logistic model. Zocchi and Atkinson [27] considered the more complex case of multinomial Logistic models. Biedermann, Dette and Pepelyshev [28] provided optimal designs for percentile estimation of a quantal response curve considering a maximin criterion leading to robust designs. Dose–response problems frequently involve binary response models either for measuring efficacy or toxicity. There is an extensive literature of optimal designs for particular dose–response models [29], [30].
López-Fidalgo, Torsney and Ardanuy [13], Torsney and López-Fidalgo [31], [32] reported MV-optimal designs for symmetric weight functions and symmetric intervals, for simple linear regression in a general interval and demonstrated numerically that for every compact interval [a, b] there is always a 2-point MV-optimal design for the Logistic model and gave the whole picture for different regions in the semi-plane b > a, where a c1-, a c2- or an EV-optimal design is MV-optimal. Hereafter, we denote by cj-optimal, the c-optimal design for the j-th parameter. Dette and Sahm [33] gave a method for computing MV-optimal designs for two different parametrizations of binary regression models. Using invariant properties the corresponding standardized SMV-optimal designs are derived easily. Some results for implementing this method computationally were given by López-Fidalgo and Tommasi [34]. López-Fidalgo and Wong [35] and Imhof, López-Fidalgo and Wong [36] compared MV- and SMV-optimal designs for binary response models.
In this paper we obtain MV-optimal designs for a binary response model, considered as a weighted linear regression model. In particular, the results of López-Fidalgo, Torsney and Ardanuy [13] and Torsney and López-Fidalgo [32] are generalized for a general non-symmetric interval, as well as for a class of weight functions typically used in biomedical sciences (Probit, Normal density, Double Exponential and Double Reciprocal). One of the novelties of the present work is to provide the nature of EV-optimal designs with three support points that appear when the Double Exponential or Double Reciprocal is considered. Moreover, the Equivalence Theorem for MV-optimality defined here takes into account the cases where the criterion is differentiable or not. Despite the interest on the MV-optimality criterion for binary response models, we have noted a lack of user-friendly software. We develop an applet for obtaining MV-optimal designs. The user/practitioner needs only to specify the weighting function (or a pdf) and the interval for the design variable. Recently, some software has been developed around optimal design of experiments in different platforms such as MATLAB or R [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. For MV-optimality, Tommasi and López-Fidalgo [42] provided a practical procedure to implement computationally some standardized minimax designs for some particular binary response models.
The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 outlines definitions and background on minimax criteria and the models considered in this work. Then, the design problem is introduced and an Equivalence Theorem for MV-optimality criteria is provided. In Section 3 we describe the structure of MV-designs. In Section 4 the user-friendly applet is presented. The utility of the applet is illustrated with two examples. Section 5 concludes with a discussion.
