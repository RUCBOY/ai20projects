Gliomas are central nervous system (CNS) tumors formed of neoplastic cells that display glial cell differentiation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the CNS, diffuse gliomas can be subdivided by the degree of malignancy into WHO grade II (lower grade) to grade IV (high malignancy) [1], [2]. Glioblastomas (GBMs), WHO grade IV tumors, are the most aggressive tumor type with a dismal prognosis despite advances in therapeutic management [3]. In contrast to GBMs, diffuse lower-grade gliomas (LGGs, grades II and III) have more-favorable outcomes and shared many similar histopathologic and genomic signatures [2], [4]. Since their therapeutic approaches are also different [5], distinguishing GBM from LGG is a very critical clinical issue. Determining the tumor grade depends on several pathological features including cytological atypia, mitotic activity, angiogenesis, and necrosis. However, there are still some pitfalls in the histopathological analysis which can lead to ambiguity in glioma grading. For example, interpretation of some criteria can vary because their definitions are semiquantitative or imprecise [6], [7]. Moreover, the heterogeneous expressions of aggressive cellular features make unguided surgical biopsies prone tosampling error, resulting in misgrading in up to 30% of cases [7], [8], [9], [10], [11].
With the development of diagnostic imaging technologies, the accuracy of estimating the malignancy of brain tumors has greatly increased by applying magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (MRI) features [12], [13]. MRI is commonly used because it provides a wide range of physiologically meaningful contrasts to distinguish different tissues by imaging, and therefore improves evaluations of heterogeneous patterns of tissue compositions within diffuse gliomas [14]. In addition to conventional sequences, several MRI techniques including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) are also applied to non-invasively differentiate LGGs from GBMs [15], [16], [17], [18]. A previous study supported MRI scans being highly specific for diagnosing brain stem gliomas and can replace biopsies before radiotherapy in most patients [19]. To avoid unnecessary operations, the role of MRI in the diagnostic imaging of brain tumors is especially crucial.
Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems based on quantitative image features and artificial intelligence classifiers were developed to assist radiologists in determining tumor types and grades [20], [21], [22]. With machine learning schemes, textural features extracted from MRI scans are used to classify different tissue types which can assist clinical decision-making regarding initial and evolving treatment strategies [23]. CAD systems can quantitatively combine numerous imaging features to estimate the likelihood of tumor malignancy by percentages. Efficient and consistent procedures can provide reliable suggestions to radiologists to avoid invasive procedures for which risks outweigh benefits.
In this study, local and global imaging features extracted from the entire tumor area on MRI scans were quantified to reveal levels of heterogeneity. Quantified image features were combined in a logistic regression classifier to generate a prediction model for each case. The performances of an individual image feature set and the combination of both local and global features were evaluated in the experiment. As a second viewer, the CAD can provide suggestions of tumor grading to the radiologists on clinical examinations.
