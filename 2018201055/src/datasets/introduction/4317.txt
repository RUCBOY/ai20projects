The classical processes of decision making in Information Technology are traditionally based on deductive knowledge modeling and simulation, so that explanation and theory—based on validations or refutations (Pierce, 1903)—usually constitute the kernel of industrial engineering knowledge management systems.
Things turn different within Data-Driven Intelligent Predictive Algorithms and Big Data, because practitioners do not need anymore domain theories and explanation-based processes to succeed in providing useful results (Hazen et al., 2016, Li et al., 2016, Zhong et al., 2016).
