Despite the availability of more powerful denaturing and solubilizing agents, urea often remains a researcher’s first choice to disperse inclusion bodies, solubilize membrane proteins and study the dynamics of unfolding and refolding [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. To a significant degree, this is because urea is essentially a nonionic compound, except at very low pH (pKa ≈0.3). The concentration of positively charged urea molecules in a urea solution can be estimated by the following equation:(1)[Urea+] = 5 ∗ [Urea] ∗ 10−pHThus, the concentration of urea+ varies as a function of pH. In 8 M urea at pH 2.4 the [Urea+] ≈ 160 mM, while at pH 4.0 the [Urea+] ≈ 1 mM. As a result, unlike charged denaturants such as guanidine hydrochloride, urea does not critically interfere with pISep pH gradient formation over the pH range 2.4–10.8. In addition, decades of broad experience have demonstrated that many proteins can be refolded successfully to some functionally native structure during dilution from high urea, a less certain result when many of the alternative means of denaturation are employed, e.g. heat and acidic pH.
Notwithstanding urea’s usefulness as an essentially uncharged solute, there is cause for concern regarding the interactions between proteins and urea degradation products, especially at neutral and alkaline pH. At alkaline pH, decomposition of urea leads to the formation of ammonia and isocyanic acid [12], [13]. The latter is an effective carbamylation agent of uncharged amino groups in proteins. Thus, the detection of unexpected protein isoforms in the alkaline pH range as a function of urea concentration during pH gradient chromatography could be taken as evidence of artifacts of carbamylation of lysine by cyanate. However, this process is unlikely to explain the chromatographic results presented here since the kinetics of carbamylation under the reported experimental conditions are too slow [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19].
This report illustrates the excellent IEX resolution of protein isoforms by computer controlled chromatographic pH gradients formed over a broad pH range in the presence of a wide range of isocratic urea concentrations. Evidence is presented demonstrating that such a chromatographic technique is an effective way to separate isoforms that co-elute in pH gradients in the absence of urea. We have named this type of chromatography Stability Influenced Ion Exchange Chromatography (SIIEX), since we believe it is likely that the denaturing effects of urea on the proteins we have examined cause the observed shifts in the proteins' apparent isoelectric point (pI) i.e. the pH at which they elute from a column in a pH gradient. We show that even at urea concentrations as low as 1 M these proteins display significant shifts in their apparent pI. These shifts in apparent pI also vary in magnitude from isoform to isoform, providing a powerful new protein purification tool. Unexpectedly, the SIIEX data imply that, especially at high urea concentrations, unfolded proteins can evolve away from their initial unfolded configurations sufficiently to restructure themselves so as to increase the binding of denatured protein forms to the stationary phase relative to binding in the less unfolded states. This provides an additional mechanism of separation and holds the promise of enabling the chromatographic investigation of the slow configurational evolution of persistent denatured forms, an important goal of basic protein science. Finally, we implement a simple modification of the electrostatic interaction (EI) theory [20] that allows the computation of “m” values − the parameters quantifying urea-induced reduction of the stabilization free energy of native proteins. In addition, the area and composition of the most likely residues configurations forming the surface patches interacting with the IEX stationary phase during SIIEX are estimated by examining one of the ovalbumin isoforms.
