Let G=(V,E) be a non-trivial connected simple graph, where V={v0,v1,…,vn−1}. Let G−uv (G+uv) be the graph formed by deleting (resp. adding) edge uv if uv ∈ E (resp. uv∉E). Let N(vi) be the set of neighbors of vi. Then di=d(vi)=|N(vi)| is the degree of vi, and Δ=Δ(G)=max0≤i≤n−1{di} is the maximum degree of G. A vertex of degree 1 is said to be a pendent vertex. π(G)=(d0,d1,…,dn−1) is called the degree sequence of G. Let P=u0u1…ul, l ≥ 1, be a path of G with d(u0) ≥ 3, d(ui)=2 for 1≤i≤l−1, and d(ul) ≠ 2. If d(ul) ≥ 3 (d(ul)=1), then P is said to be an internal path (resp. a pendent path) of G.
The inverse sum indeg (ISI) index of G is defined as ISI(G)=∑vivj∈Ef(di,dj), where f(x,y)=xy/(x+y). This recently developed topological index is shown to has a nice predicting ability for the total surface area of octane isomers [1]. Therefore, it has attracted much attention recently. The extremal ISI index has been determined by Sedlar et al. [2] for connected graphs, chemical trees, chemical graphs, graphs with given maximum degree, minimum degree, or number of pendent vertices, and trees with k leaves. An and Xiong [3] later obtained the extremal ISI index among graphs with prescribed matching number, vertex connectivity, or independence number. Similar results were also derived by Chen and Deng [4] for graphs with prescribed connectivity, chromatic number, clique number, independence number, covering number, or vertex bipartiteness. Falahati-Nezhad et al. [5] established sharp bounds of ISI index using graph invariants, including the order, radius, size, and number of pendent vertices. Gutman et al. [6] presented several inequalities for ISI index and characterized the extremal graphs. Recently, several lower bounds were obtained in [7]. For more results concerning ISI index, we refer to [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15].
For trees, it was proven in [2] that the star uniquely has minimal ISI index. However, the characterization of trees having maximal ISI index seems difficult. There are even no sound conjectures on their structure up to now. For convenience, let C(π) (T(π)) be the set of connected graphs (resp. trees) whose degree sequence is π, and call an n-vertex tree with maximal ISI index in T(π) an optimal tree. Naturally, the “Searching - Conjecturing - Proving” technique routine is applicable to address this problem, which has been successfully applied to the characterization of trees having minimal atom-bond connectivity index (see [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]),
In this paper, we attempt to solve this problem, though unable to have a complete solution yet. In Section 2, it is shown that, among C(π) there is a so-called BFS-graph having maximal ISI index. This result enables us to conduct a computer search for n-vertex optimal tree(s) up to n=150. Based on the search outputs, some structural properties of an optimal tree are observed and proven in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, several problems and conjectures on the structure of optimal trees are proposed.
