In geophysics backscattered waves are ideally suited to explore planar or gently curved interfaces, or a small number of isolated inhomogeneities. Diffractions from a very large number of randomly spaced scatterers generally cannot be resolved and are considered source-generated noise (Levin and Robinson, 1969, Korvin, 1978). To statistically treat this noise, the solution of the wave equation with random velocity, c(1)∇2F−1c2⋅∂2F∂t2=0,c=c0(1+ϵ),〈ϵ(x,y,z)〉=0,〈ϵ(x,y,z)〉=ϵ2≪1
(where 〈⋯〉 denotes average over all realizations of a random process), is expressed by the Kirchoff integral(2)F(t)∝k0⋅∫Vε(x,y,z)s(t−2rc0)r2⋅dV
where F(t) is the backscattered signal at (x,y,z)=(0,0,0), z points downwards into the medium, r=x2+y2+z2, V is the spatial domain containing the scatterers, s(t) is a sinusoidal source-signal of duration T with dominant frequency f0, satisfying ∫0Ts(t)dt=0,s(t)≡0fort∉[0,T], and(3)k0=2πf0c0
is average wavenumber. For point-wise scatterers with scattering strength ρi at distances ri from the origin, Eq. (2) becomes(4)F(t)=k0⋅∫Vs(t−2rc0)r2⋅∑iρiδ(x−xi,y−yi,z−zi)dV=∑iais(t−ti);(ai=k0ρiri,ti=2ric0).
Suppose that by applying a proper high-pass filter followed by gain control the sequence {ai} can be made stationary satisfying 〈ai〉=0,〈ai2〉=a2, for all i. How much information do we obtain about the medium by observing F(t)? Three cases should be distinguished.
(A) If the independence, homogeneity and rarity of the diffraction points make them Poisson-distributed in space then (Jánossy et al., 1950) {ti} will also be a Poissonian in time. By Campbell's theorems on stochastic processes derived from the Poisson process (Horton, 1955, Horton, 1957, Rytov, 1966), the mean value, variance, autocorrelation function and power spectrum of F(t) satisfy:(5a)〈F(t)〉=〈∑ais(t−ti)〉=〈ai〉∫−∞∞s(t)dt=0(5b)〈F2(t)〉=a2⋅λ⋅∫−∞∞s2(t)dt(5c)RFF(τ)=∫−∞∞e−iωτ〈F(t)F(t+τ)〉dτ=a2⋅λ⋅∫−∞∞s(t)s(t+τ)dt(5d)WFF(ω)=∫−∞∞e−iωτRFF(τ)dτ=a2⋅λ⋅|∫−∞∞eiωts(t)dt|2
where λ is density of the arrival-times process {ti}. In this case, the scattered noise F(t) contains information on a2λ, but not on the average amplitude a=〈ai2〉, arrival density λ, or velocity c0.
(B) For scatterers uniformly distributed in a near-surface layer 0≤z≤H, or in the infinite half-space z≥0, respectively, Campbell theorems lead to (Olshevsky, 1966)(6a)〈F(x,t)F(x+ξ,t)〉〈F2(x,t)〉=J0(k0ξ)
for shallow-lying scatterers (where J0 is the zero order Bessel function of first degree, ξ<<H), and(6b)〈F(x,t)F(x+ξ,t)〉〈F2(x,t)〉=sink0ξk0ξ
for scatterers in the half-space (Korvin, 1978). In both cases (6a, b) the value of k0, i.e. the average velocity c0 as well, can be determined from the first zero-crossing of the autocorrelation function.
(C) For a fractal distribution of r0-sized scattererers in an R-sized (R>>r0) domain of the E-dimensional space, their total mass, density and correlation function scale as(7a,b,c)M∝(Rr0)D;ρ∝(Rr0)D−E;C(ξ→)∝|ξ→|D−E,
while the intensity of the scattered wave falls off with increasing wave-numbers as(8)s(q→)=∬dx→dx´→C(x→−x´→)exp[iq→(x→−x´)→]s(q→)∝|q→|−D
that is the mass fractal dimension D of the scatterers can be found by Fourier analysing the scattered wave field (Korvin, 1992). Berry, 1972, Berry, 1979 was the first to consider fractal scattering ("diffractals", as he called them) in time-domain (see also (Korvin, 1982)). Berry proved that if both source and receiver are at (0,0,h), above a random fractal surface ζ(x,y), 〈ζ〉=0, 〈ζ2〉<<h, then the expected intensity of a monochromatic pulse 'echo' falls off when time t=(2h/c)+τ →∞ as(9)I(τ)=τ−(3−d)
where c is wave-speed in the free space, d+1 is the surface's fractal dimension.
Some 10 years ago, our group also used a time-domain approach to find the fractal dimension of volume scatterers in soil (Oleschko et al., 2002, Oleschko et al., 2003). We used ground penetrating radar (GPR) of 225 MHz peak frequency over soil to determine the fractal dimension of the soil's permittivity network. We assumed that pores containing high-permittivity fluid behave as point scatterers, distributed in the plane of measurement as a mass fractal of dimension D, 1≤D≤2. Then using Hunt's (1998) theorem, we proved that the backscattered signature F(t) is self-affine with Hurst-exponent H=2−D. H can be found from rescaled-range (R/S) analysis (Mandelbrot, 1983) of F(t), or from its autocovariance function which behaves for small lags τ as(10)〈F(t)F(t+τ)〉=R(τ)≈R(0){1−const⋅τ2α};α=2−H
To prove theoretically (Oleschko et al., 2002, Oleschko et al., 2003) that the scattered wave field inherits the fractal dimension of the scatterers, we used the first Born approximation, and only treated multiple scattering later (Korvin and Oleschko, 2004). For a numerical study of microwaves in fractal media, we developed a computer program "Maxwell" to simulate the reflection and transmission of normally incident EM waves in arbitrary media, including all multiples and a frequency-dependent attenuation. For microwave frequencies (a few hundred MHz), the soil or a sedimentary rock can be specified by their permittivity distribution, their electric conductivity and magnetic susceptibility can be neglected (von Hippel, 1954, Davis and Annan, 1989, Peplinski et al., 1995).
This is our first publication describing the simulation algorithm in full details. Section 2 reviews wave simulation in Geophysics. The algorithm (Section 3) computes the Fourier transform of the reflected and transmitted microwaves normally incident on a slab with arbitrarily distributed complex dielectric permittivity. The complex value of permittivity allows to realize wave attenuation. The wave equation is approximated in Fourier domain by a second order difference scheme, solved with a sweep method (Samarskii, 1989) adapted to complex variables (A. V. Andreev and R. V. Khachaturov, "Reflection and scattering of X-rays at multilayer nano-structures with rough interfaces," Moscow, 1996., Khachaturov, 1996, Khachaturov, 1999, Khachaturov, 2009). Details are given in Appendix A Order of approximation of the difference scheme, Appendix B Definition of the imaginary part of dielectric permittivity, Appendix C Stability of the complex sweep method.
Section 4 summarizes input data preparation and program run, and contains simulation examples for high-frequency wave reflection from images of geologic media.
