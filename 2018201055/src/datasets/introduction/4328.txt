A dominating set of a graph G with vertex set V is a subset D of V, such that each vertex in V∖D is adjacent to at least one vertex belonging to D. We call D a minimum dominating set (MDS) if it has the smallest cardinality, and the cardinality of a MDS is called the domination number of graph G. The MDS problem has numerous practical applications in different fields [1], particularly in networked systems, such as routing on ad hoc wireless networks [2], [3], multi-document summarization in sentence graphs [4], and controllability in protein interaction networks [5]. Recently, from the angle of MDS, structural controllability of complex networks has been addressed [6], [7], providing an alternative new viewpoint of the control problem for large-scale networks [8], [9].
Despite the vast applications, solving the MDS problem of a graph is a challenge, because finding a MDS of a graph is NP-hard [1]. Over the past years, the MDS problem has attracted considerable attention from theoretical computer science [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], discrete and combinatorial mathematics [15], [16], [17], as well as statistical physics [18], and continues to be an active object of research [19], [20]. Extensive empirical research [21] uncovered that most real networks exhibit the prominent scale-free behavior [22], with the degree of their vertices following a power-law distribution P(k)∼k−γ. Although an increasing number of studies have been focused on MDS problem, related works about MDS problem in scale-free networks are very rare [6], [23]. In particular, exact results for domination number and the number of minimum dominating sets in a scale-free network are still lacking.
Due to the ubiquity of scale-free phenomenon in realistic networks, unveiling the behavior of minimum dominating sets with respect to power-law degree distribution is important for better understanding the applications of MDS problem in real-life scale-free networks. On the other hand, determining the domination number and enumerating all minimum dominating sets in a generic network are formidable [1], it is thus of great interest to find specific scale-free networks for which the MDS problem can be exactly solved [24].
In this paper, we focus on the domination number and the number of minimum dominating sets in a scale-free network, called pseudofractal scale-free web [25], [26] and the Sierpiński graph with the same number of vertices and edges. For both networks, we determine the exact domination number and the number of all different minimum dominating sets. The domination number of the pseudofractal scale-free web is only half of that of the Sierpiński graph. In addition, in the pseudofractal scale-free web, there is a unique minimum dominating set, while in Sierpiński graph the number of all different minimum dominating sets grows exponentially with the number of vertices in the graph. We show the root of the difference of minimum dominating sets between studied networks rests with their architecture dissimilarity, with the pseudofractal scale-free web being heterogeneous while the Sierpiński graph being homogeneous.
