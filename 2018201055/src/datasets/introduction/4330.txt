We wish to acknowledge the efforts of Prof. Vojko Vlachy in the area of developing interatomic potentials for liquid water (see, e.g., Ref. [1]), by dedicating this paper to his 70th birthday.
For computer simulations with interaction potentials (see, e.g., Ref. [2]), comparison with experimental data is essential. With a focus on the microscopic structure, the proper quantity to compare with is the total scattering structure factor (TSSF), F(Q) (for the definition of this quantity, as well of the other functions that appear in this work, see Ref. [3]). F(Q) is accessible by neutron- and X-ray diffraction experiments [4].
In this communication, our objective is to assess, from the structural point of view, capabilities of various interaction potentials that have been developed for water. Liquid water is arguably the material that has been targeted by the largest number of computer simulation studies, resulting in an excessive number of interaction potential parameter sets. The importance of the issue is reflected by the fact that new potential parameters have been introduced even during the very last calendar years [5], [6]. Adequate sources that introduce many of the available interaction potential models for liquid water may be, for instance, Refs. [7], [8], [9]. Unfortunately, the majority of (even relatively recent) simulation studies display comparisons with the ‘experimental’ partial radial distribution functions (PRDF-s), gij(r) [3], only (see, e.g. Refs. [5], [10], [11]), which functions have been demonstrated quite a few times to be only (better or worse) interpretations of measured diffraction data (see, e.g., [12], [13], [14], [15]).
The most suitable quantity to cross-check with would be the direct experimental information, the total scattering structure factors, F(Q). In order to handle this issue, a simple protocol had been developed some years ago [13], that was soon after applied to liquid water [14]. The protocol took advantage of the Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) algorithm [16] that had originally been suggested for generating large, 3D structures (sets of atomic coordinates) that would be consistent with measured diffraction data. In the protocol applied here [13], [14], consistency with simulated PRDF-s was also a requirement (see below for more details). An important piece of result from the latter investigation was that out of the water potential models considered there, it was TIP4P-2005 [11] that proved to be consistent at the highest level with a given neutron diffraction (ND) data set [17] taken on pure liquid heavy water. As a follow-up pilot investigation [18], 3 relatively new water potentials, the rigid, polarizable BK3 [5] and SWM4-DP [10], as well as the rigid, non-polarizable TIP4P/2005 [11] ones, were considered together with not only neutron-, but also with one particular set of X-ray diffraction (XRD) TSSF [19]. It was found that these three potentials perform roughly at the same, very good, level, with a slight advantage of the most recent BK3 parameters [5].
In this work, we wish to extend substantially the investigations described in Refs. [14], [18], by
(a)considering PRDF-s from classical molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations with 9 water potentials: apart from the already mentioned BK3 [5], SWM4-DP [10] and TIP4P/2005 [12], well known traditional parameters such as the non-polarizable rigid ST2 [20], flexible BJH [21], rigid TIP3P [22], rigid TIP4P [22] and rigid SPC/E [23], and the polarizable rigid POL3 [24]. In addition, PRDF-s from an ‘ab initio’ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation [25] are also included, thus providing the possibility of some comparison between structural results of classical and quantum (see, e.g., Refs. [26], [27], [28]) molecular dynamics simulations. (Note that the AIMD calculations of Ref. [25] repeated those of Ref. [27] in a smaller simulation box.)(b)inspecting compatibility with not only one neutron- and one X-ray, but with combinations of one neutron- [17] and three X-ray [19], [29], [30] diffraction data sets. The three X-ray data sets represent three different concepts for data evaluation: X1 [29] considers O atoms with 8 electrons and H atoms with 1 electron each; X2 [19] takes water molecules as one single scatterer; finally, X3 [30] is claimed to be a proper O-O partial structure factor. (X2 and X3 may therefore be expected to be rather similar.) Note that there is still not a consensus concerning which formalism/philosophy is the most appropriate (see, e.g., discussions in Ref. [30]).(c)refining standardisation of the PRDF-s that are exploited as input for RMC calculations (see below).
During the simultaneous RMC modeling of one ND and one XRD (either X1, X2 or X3) TSSF and 3 PRDF-s from MD simulations, representing a given water potential model, experimental data were required to be approached within errors (at the same level as if no PRDF-s were present). PRDF-s, in turn, were fitted as closely as possible subject to the constraint just mentioned. This way, in fortunate cases, the quality of crude RMC water structures (for examples, see, e.g., Refs. [12], [31]) could be improved, in the sense that they would be as similar to sensible potential-based structures as the requirement of approaching experimental TSSF-s allows.
Our findings will be presented in terms of numerical values of ‘goodness-of-fit’-s to the sets of simulated partial radial distribution functions (for the definition of the appropriate characteristics, the so-called ‘Rw’-factors, see Refs. [15], [18], [32]). The smaller these goodness-of-fit values are, the higher is the level of consistency between measurement and simulation; in other words, the more suitable the given interatomic potential is for the improvement of RMC structural models.
The next section provides some details of the Reverse Monte Carlo calculations performed; next, results will be presented and finally, conclusions will be drawn.
