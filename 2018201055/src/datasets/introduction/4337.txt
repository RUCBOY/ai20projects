Topic detection and tracking (TDT), as a representative approach of topic analysis, can be dated to the 1990s, highlighting the task of identifying topics from a collection of documents [1]. Using co-word, citation statistics, or topic models, TDT has become a significant bibliometric tool [2] and assists in the studies of science, technology, innovation, and policy (STIP), e.g., profiling research performance [3], [4], exploring emergent scientific or technological topics [5], [6], and tracing scientific activities and development trends [7], [8]. However, the development of science and technology is a process with incremental change and disruptive revolution, and both the external representation and the internal content of a scientific topic changes over time [9]. Unfortunately, traditional approaches of topic analysis are relatively static; they apply fixed models to the entire dataset and ignore any possible change resulting from time. As an example, the research scope of Knowledge-based Systems is always changing, from expert systems in the 1990s to broad disciplines in computer science and artificial intelligence, e.g., machine learning, data mining, optimization, and decision science. Under these circumstances, two questions are raised by the journal Knowledge-based Systems’ (KnoSys) research community: “What is the KnoSys community interested in?” and “How does such interest change over time?”. The answers are significant to both the editorial board and the audience of KnoSys.
To address the above questions, we focused on topics derived from all articles in KnoSys and conducted a topic-based bibliometric study to discover the topic changes in KnoSys from 1991 to 2016. The main objectives of this paper are: 1) profiling hotspots to outline the research landscape of KnoSys; 2) detecting the topic changes of KnoSys from 1991 to 2016 by tracing the predecessors and descendants of topics in evolutionary routes; and 3) predicting research trends of significant topics in KnoSys. These objectives were achieved using a model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [10] to profile the research landscape of KnoSys by identifying academic hotspots from a probabilistic perspective. Then a model of scientific evolutionary pathways (SEP) [11] applied a learning-based process to detect the topic changes in KnoSys in a given time period, in which offline data was simulated as a data stream and the function of “sleeping beauties” was specifically used to indicate emerging topics. A prediction model is then proposed to foresee possible topic trends of KnoSys by using a probability-based weighting approach.
This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the data, including related data sources, search strategy and pre-processing efforts. Section 3 follows and profiles the research landscape of KnoSys by using the LDA-based topic model. In Section 4, following the SEP model the evolutionary pathways of KnoSys topics from 1991 to 2016 are visualized in the form of science maps. Predictions of future topic trends of KnoSys are given in Section 5. We summarize the key findings and draw an in-depth and open discussion on the development of KnoSys in Section 6. Section 7 concludes our study and addresses concerns on the limitations and future directions of our study.
