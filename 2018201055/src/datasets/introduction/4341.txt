The laser-induced crystallization (LIC) of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has been a subject of extensive research in recent years, motivated predominantly by technological applications to thin film semiconductors. LIC studies instrumented by Raman spectroscopy appeared more recently [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], enabling in situ quantification of the phase composition, along with an indirect estimate of the sample temperature and other structural properties [6], [7]. The main advantage of this approach is that the same laser may simultaneously control the LIC process and also serve as the Raman excitation laser source. Laser as a heat source, in comparison to conventional furnace heating, also offers fast heating-up of the probe to very high temperatures. Raman instrumented LIC is thus a simple and effective analytical technique to study the phase transformation kinetics at high temperatures.
This study examines the solid phase crystallization of thin film amorphous silicon (a-Si) induced by a continuous-wave laser. The progress of crystallization is monitored by sequential Raman spectroscopy. For closer analysis by means of computation simulations, a mathematical model of the crystallization process was designed, with the capability to account for the existing non-uniform temperature field.
