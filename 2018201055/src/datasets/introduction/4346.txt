Organizing and rendering optimal health services require the management of huge amounts of information, and automation of health information management processes is inevitable in today’s competitive environment. Reducing healthcare costs and enhancing the quality of the services in the health scope require information systems. Healthcare information systems could improve the health care practitioners’ performance and the quality of the patient outcome [1]. A Hospital Information System (HIS) is a computer system designed to manage all the aspects of a hospital's operations such as clinical, administrative, and financial activities [2], [3]. However, implementation of the HIS is very difficult and complicated. Thus, for relative success of these systems, items such as human factors, costs, and time should be considered (3, 4). Jabraeily and Mbananga introduced inadequate training and resistance of users as the main causes of information systems failure [4], [5].
Success could be defined as achievement of a purpose, business reputation, or position. Likewise, in health information systems, success is the usefulness of the information system for users and healthcare managers [6], [7]. Given the complexity of information systems, their success and failure could be seen in various situations [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. A study by Fowler showed that only 28% of information systems have a successful performance. Furthermore, this report indicated that development of an information system, even in the best situation, is gradual and time-consuming and involves high costs [8].
Nearly three-quarters of all information system projects face with failure [11]. Even in the United States of America, there are reports of the failure of half of the healthcare information system projects [7], [12]. Although information systems have been used in health care organizations for more than three decades, completely successful cases of these systems are not commonly encountered [10]. These systems optimize operational activities and improve the organizational performance as well as the patients’ and users’ satisfaction [13], [14], [15], [16]. Failed information systems are unable to meet theirs users’ and patients’ satisfaction [6], [10].
With the increasing impact of information technology on organizations and their costs, it is critical to evaluate the quality of the services offered by these information technologies, especially in terms of user satisfaction [17], [18]. Evaluation of the HISs for improvement of healthcare services and ensuring their successful implantation and positive effects on healthcare delivery are very important [17], [19], [20]. Hospital information systems are frequently implemented. However, these systems are rarely evaluated to assess whether they have achieved their main goals although it is critical to evaluate these systems’ advantages and disadvantages [21]. Regardless of the HIS advantages, these systems are not without problems [22], [23]. Appropriate evaluation guarantees the success of these systems [24], [25] and could sometimes solve the existing problems [22], [26].
Given the huge investments on the development and implementation of hospital information systems, evaluation of the success or failure of these systems seems to be necessary to appreciate their value and efficiency [27]. The measurement of user satisfaction with information systems is the most effective method for the evaluation of these systems [28]. Because of the complexity of hospital health information systems, numerous factors influence their success or failure such as functional, technical, cultural, economic [7], [29], legal, political, ethical, organizational, and managerial factors [7]. Evaluation of the users’ perception of the HIS and quantifying their satisfaction instead of considering technical aspects of these systems is very important because a well- developed system is considered weak if its users recognize it as a weak system [30]. There is no unique standard method for successful implementation of health information systems so that a failed method in one healthcare facility may work very well in another [31].
Generally, HIS evaluation could provide evidence whether it has achieved its expected goals and offer reasons for the success of the system. Furthermore, HIS evaluation is useful for policy and managerial decision making and budget allocation to promote the HIS [32]. The present study aimed to evaluate the success or failure of hospital information systems in public hospitals affiliated with Zahedan University of Medical Sciences. Moreover, we tested one hypothesis related to the determinants of the success or failure of hospital information systems and the computer skill level of the respondents as follows:H1There is a significant relationship between the respondents’ computer skill level and the surveyed factors.
