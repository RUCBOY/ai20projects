Apart from providing legal protection for inventions, patents in recent times have become a direct source of revenue. A patent generates revenue either through licensing or sale. Around 20% of US patents granted to small innovators (with less than 5 patents) get traded at least once during their life of 20 years [1]. However, value of a patent changes over time [1], [2], [3]. Therefore, given the limited time for enforcement of patent rights (20 years in US) and the change in value over time, knowledge about the age at which the patent when sold can gain maximum value during its life becomes critical.
In this paper, we aim to demystify the relationship between age and selling price of a patent. Specifically, we look at four dimensions. Firstly, we attempt to understand whether there exists a cut off age before or after which the selling price of a United States patent becomes significantly higher especially when the US patent gets sold in a single invention lot. Secondly, we verify whether the cut off age changes when multiple United States patents get sold in portfolio lots. Thirdly, we explore whether the relationship between patent age and selling price changes across different bundling strategies used for forming the single invention lot and the portfolio lot. The bundling strategies include four different bundling variations for single invention lots and eight different bundling variations for portfolio lots. Fourthly, we explore technology field variations in the age and selling price relationship. For the paper, age refers to the time elapsed from grant of the patent to sale [1], [3], [4], and selling price of a patent forms the surrogate for patent value [5], [6], [7], [8].
Price of a patent becomes difficult to predict because of the uncertainty associated with its commercial gains [9]. The uncertainty reduces when the patent moves forward in its commercialization process into a new product prototype stage confirming its translational potential [10]. From the non-linearity perspective, we can argue for the distribution of prices to have one or more change points across the life of a patent. Change point in a distribution refers to the point dividing the curve into segments such that each segment follows a different distribution [11], [12]. In other words, change point marks whether the price a patent fetches changes significantly before or after a particular age and if so then at what age. Sneed and Johnson [3] found the effect of age on selling price as convex, that is, the probability of a successful patent sale becomes minimal at 9 years 9 months with higher probabilities before and after. Similarly, Serrano [13] found only 2% probability of a patent being traded at age 9, but 27.8% probability of the patent getting expired at age 9. In other words, literature, albeit limited, finds patents have higher chance of fetching a high price during certain years of age. Should a patent holder wait for the uncertainty to mitigate? If yes, then the decision about how long to wait needs to be researched.
Change in the age-price relationship with changes in the strategy used for bundling a set of patents is important to know as well. Literature demonstrates the advantages of bundling or tying of patents as scenario specific [14], [15], [16], [17]. Large patent family (simple, extended or Derwent), indicating wider geographical protection, has high value [2], [18]. However, patenting in multiple jurisdictions adds to the cost in terms of filing fee, processing fee, patent attorney fee and maintenance fee [8], [19], [20] and hence influences the price of the patent [8]. Patents sold in different bundled lots, therefore, may exhibit varying relationship between age and price. We explore these variations in selling price for more insights.
Additionally, we explore the differences between technology fields. Different technology fields have different life cycle time periods. For example, ICT inventions may have shorter life cycle than the pharmaceutical inventions [21] and hence impact the age-selling price relationship. Portfolios formed of technologically related patents are considered more valuable than unrelated ones [15], [16]. As an important aspect from the bundling perspective, technology fields are statistically explored for selling price variations.
For the analysis we classify the single invention lots as (1) a pure US singleton which includes only one US grant without bundling with any foreign rights, (2) a simple patent family which includes one US grant and the associated foreign rights or equivalents (also referred as parallel patents) related based on a single priority date (3)a pure US singleton along with an expired provisional application or a US continuation application abandoned before sale, and (4) a simple patent family along with an expired provisional application or a US continuation application abandoned before sale.
A portfolio lot includes (1) a pure US singleton with US pending application(s) or a US national patent family with US pending application(s). A US national patent family refers to group of US patents related through one or more priorities and does not include foreign filings. (2) a simple patent family with US pending application(s) or an extended patent family with US pending application(s). Extended patent family or INPADOC family refers to all the patent filings linked to one or more priority dates either directly or indirectly and includes foreign filings as well [8], [22]. (3) multiple pure US singletons or a US national patent family without pending/expired/abandoned US applications (4) multiple simple patent families or extended patent families without pending/expired/abandoned US applications (5) multiple pure US singletons with expired/abandoned US applications or a US national patent family with expired/abandoned US applications (6) multiple simple patent families or extended patent families with expired/abandoned US applications (7) multiple pure US singletons or a US national patent family with pending US applications (8) multiple simple patent families or extended patent families with pending US applications. INPADOC extended patent families and US national families are classified as portfolio bundles. The Derwent patent family, which classifies patents into families based on experts' decision and priority dates, remains unexplored in the paper due to total lack of access to relevant data.
