As posterior pedicle screw placement was first described by Boucher [1] in the 1950s, this method has steadily improved and gained popularity. Pedicle screws are currently placed in the lumbar spine via three main techniques: freehand, fluoroscopy guidance and stereotactic navigation [2]. The implementation of pedicle screws based on anatomical landmarks and intraoperative fluoroscopy seems to be most widespread in spine surgery, especially in developing countries, for its relatively handy equipment and mature technique.
Regardless of improving skills and advanced instruments [3], knowledge of spinal anatomy, established landmarks, and tactile feedback are still critical in posterior pedicle screw placement [4]. As previous literature shows, posterior pedicle screw fixation can provide strongest support for the spinal stability [5]. However, various complications, including cortical breach, vascular or nerve injury, cerebrospinal fluid leakage [6], may occur because of narrow pedicles or unskilled technique. Since many vital tissues like neural elements are in close relationship to the pedicles, neural damage may occur particularly when the medial or inferior cortex of the pedicle is penetrated.
Lumbosacral spines, including the 3rd lumbar spines (L3), the 4th lumbar spines (L4), the 5th lumbar spines (L5) and the 1st sacral spines (S1), are common sites undergoing posterior instrumentation because of more spinal disorders present. Surgeons always considered L5 and S1 as the safest segments for their comparatively wide pedicles. However, the anatomical structures of pedicles of L5 and S1 are very special. The goal of the study is to describe the clinical accuracy and safety of different lumbar segments in the placement of posterior pedicle screws via fluoroscopy guidance, especially in L5 and S1 due to clinical findings.
