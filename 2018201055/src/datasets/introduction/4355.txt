The creation of designed and curated data sets for grand challenges and independent evaluations has been an important driving force behind progress in biometrics over the last two decades [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Data sets distributed to the research community foster the development of new algorithms and technologies, and they allow independent evaluations of the state-of-the-art. Data sets also contribute to the identification of future research directions, especially if the data is available to the research community with minimal restrictions on its use. This paper describes a decade-long data collection effort that collected approximately 1 million biometric samples. The biometrics data collected supported seminal grand challenges in still and 3D face recognition and iris recognition that were key steps in fielding face and iris recognition systems.
Much of the collected data is available by license to the research community, and some data set components have been downloaded hundreds of times. The collection team continues to receive many requests per month. These data sets can serve as an “on-ramp” for new research groups entering the field. Since data sets are associated with experimental designs, new algorithms can be evaluated in a context that is well established and considered canonical by the research community. However, research groups can also identify new biometrics problems by examining data sets and experimental results using them.
The focus of this paper is the design and execution of biometric data collection. Our goals are: (i) to provide guidance to prospective collectors; (ii) to highlight the key challenges that arise when planning and executing such an activity; and (iii) to highlight the research advances that resulted from our work.
