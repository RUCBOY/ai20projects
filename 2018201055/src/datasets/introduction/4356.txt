Adsorption of gases on the homogeneous surfaces of solids such as graphitized thermal carbon black (GTCB) has been explored extensively, both theoretically and experimentally, with detailed analysis of adsorption isotherms, isosteric heats and, to a lesser extent, heat capacity and diffraction techniques such as LEED [1]. A major motivation, particularly in the sub-monolayer region, is the interest in gaining insight into the interaction between a solid and an adsorbate atom and the two dimensional (2D) phase transitions [2], [3]. A number of pioneering works have been devoted to this topic [4], [5], [6] and the 2D phase behaviour of monolayer adsorbed films can be summarized as follows [7], [8], [9]: 
(1).At temperatures well below the 2D triple point, a 2D transition between the gas-like phase and the liquid (solid)-like phase occurs, via a first-order transition with a large change in the adsorbed density.(2).Between the 2D triple point and the 2D critical temperature, there are two steps in the isotherm resulting from the 2D vapor-liquid and liquid-solid transitions.(3).Above the 2D critical temperature, the adsorbate behaves as a 2D supercritical fluid, and can rearrange to form a 2D solid at a higher pressure within a certain range of temperatures.(4).As chemical potential (pressure) is further increased, there is a 2D solid-solid transition between commensurate and incommensurate solids which is found over a wide range of temperature from below the 2D triple point to above the 2D critical point.
The transitions (3) and (4) are usually referred as ordering transitions. Experimental [10], [11] and simulation [12], [13] studies have shown that an ordering transition is one of the microscopic origins of hysteresis in nonporous materials above the 2D triple temperature, due to a molecular rearrangement which progressively compresses the adsorbed layers, enhancing the interaction energy despite a loss in entropy.
Ordering transitions on graphitic adsorbents have attracted experimental and theoretical attention for Ne [14], Ar [15], N2 [16], [17], [18], Kr [19], [20], Xe [21] and CH4 [10], [22]. The structure of the adsorbed film is a consequence of a balance between the interaction between the adsorbate molecules, which favours their optimal packing within the film, and the interaction of the adsorbate molecules with the solid, which tends to favour a first layer adsorbate structure that is in registry with the corrugated potential of the graphite surface. The transition between commensurate (C) and incommensurate (IC) packing of adsorbate on the surface is a classical example of this balance. In the commensurate structure (C) each adsorbate molecule occupies one of three of the honey-comb cells on the graphite lattice (with a carbon-carbon bond length of 0.142 nm), giving a surface density of 10.54 μmol/m2. In the (IC) structure the adsorbate molecules are packed in a 2D close-packed hexagonal array in the first layer with an equilibrium separation of 21/6σff, where σff is the collision diameter of the adsorbate molecule, and are out of registry with the graphite lattice. These structures are illustrated in Fig. 1. The C-IC and IC-C transitions have been carefully elucidated by Thomy and Duval [5], [6], [21], and are a complex function of the size and shape of the adsorbate molecule as well as the relative strength of the adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-substrate interactions. For Kr, a substep is observed in the adsorption isotherm at 87 K, corresponding to a C-IC transition; on the other hand, Xe exhibits an IC-C transition at the same temperature. For argon at 77 K, no C-phase has been identified in any previous study because argon is smaller than Kr or Xe, and the weak attraction of the shallow potential wells of the corrugated potential is insufficient to overcome the gain in adsorbate-adsorbate interaction in the close packed first layer. Despite this, the Ar isotherm at this temperature does show a clear inflection in the region of monolayer coverage [23], [24].Download : Download high-res image (383KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Apart from the increase in the adsorbate density, at around the monolayer coverage, the ordering transition in the monolayer is also identified by a spike in the plot of the isosteric heat versus loading (hereafter referred to as the heat curve) [22], [25], [26]. Early experiments on argon adsorption on graphite at 77 K failed to detect the heat spike, because of the low resolution of the apparatus used, and the discrete nature of the measurements [27], [28]. The sharp spike in the heat curve for Ar and N2 at 77 K was first reported by Rouquerol and co-workers, who developed a method in which adsorptive was introduced into the adsorption cell at a much slower rate than the rate of adsorption, so that the system is in a state of quasi-equilibrium. This provided a novel means to trace the isotherm and isosteric heat continuously with respect to the change in pressure [23], [24]. Although the argon heat spike has been successfully reproduced by molecular simulation [29], [30], the heat curve for the N2-graphite system remains challenging. Typically, the 10-4-3 potential [31], with parameters of σC = 0.34 nm and εC/kB = 28 K, has been employed to describe the interaction of an atom with the solid on a homogeneous continuum graphite, built from equally spaced graphene layers. However, this model in combination with the TraPPE model for N2, which has two LJ sites and three partial charges, fails to describe the heat spike, although the simple 1LJ site model [32] fairs better in describing the experimental data. Moreover, the 10-4-3 model over-predicts the amount adsorbed in the multilayer region.
Recently, by taking account of the potential energy corrugation parallel to the surface, as in the original Steele potential [31], and the polarization anisotropy of graphite, Ustinov [33] was able to describe the ordering transition of nitrogen on graphite by reducing the collision diameter of carbon to 0.26 nm for all graphene layers. However, this value is in contradiction to the established structure of graphite [34], which has an interlayer spacing of 0.3354 nm.
In this work, we have developed a new model for graphite, which includes the following features:
(1)Corrugation in the potential parallel to the surface.(2)A smaller collision diameter of 0.28 nm, for carbon atoms in the outermost graphene layer, compared to 0.34 nm for the inner layers.(3)An increase in the interaction energy well-depth parameter to 35 K, for carbon atoms in the outermost layer, compared to the accepted value of 28 K for the inner layers.(4)A closer spacing between the first and second graphene layers than that between the inner layers.
The aim of this study is to present new experimental results for this system, covering a wider temperature range than hitherto reported, and to use the new potential model to investigate the adsorption isotherms and isosteric heats of argon on a graphite surface. We place special emphasis on the transition from the 2D liquid-like to a solid-like adsorbate, and subsequently to an incommensurate solid, and on the structural change in the adsorbate across the ordering transition, by analyzing the various contributions to the isosteric heat.
