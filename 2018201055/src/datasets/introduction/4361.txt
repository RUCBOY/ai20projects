The 5-HT6 receptor is the most recently identified member of the serotonin (5-HT) receptor superfamily. The human 5-HT6 receptor (5-HT6R) was discovered by Kohen et al. in 1996 [1], three years later after the first isolation of this receptor from rat striatum by two scientific groups independently [2], [3]. The 5-HT6R is distributed in the central nervous system (CNS), especially, is located in brain areas involved in learning and memory processes. Intensive preclinical studies have shown that 5-HT6R antagonists could be a promising drug with cognitive improvement in psychiatric (e.g. schizophrenia, depression) or neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's disease), and for obesity treatment [4]. Several studies have shown that not only antagonists but also agonists have potency for the treatment of obesity or cognitive disfunctions [5]. Since 1999 when the first selective 5-HT6R antagonists were described, various compounds have been synthesized as potential agents for this protein target. Some of them were successful in the primary pharmacological screening or even have reached clinical studies, e.g. dimebon (discontinued after phase III) or LUAE58054 (idalopirdine), where their utility has been or still is verified [6]. However till now, no 5-HT6 ligand has been accepted as a CNS-drug that could reach pharmaceutical market. Thus, the further search for new chemical families of the 5-HT6R ligands, including compounds with high affinity and good CNS-drugability properties, are a challenge for medicinal chemistry.
More than ten years ago, López-Rodríguez suggested a pharmacophore model for the 5-HT6R antagonists. This model includes a triangle topology with tops of a bulky hydrophobic area (HYD), a positive ionizable nitrogen (PI) and a hydrogen bond acceptor (HBA) as well as a central aromatic fragment (AR, Fig. 1) [7].Download : Download high-res image (157KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Pharmacophore model for the 5-HT6R ligands elaborated by López-Rodríguez et al. [7] (distances in Å); PI (red) – positive ionizable atom; HBA (green) – hydrogen bond acceptor, HYD (blue) – hydrophobic site, AR (yellow) – aromatic-hydrophobic ring.

For the most potent 5-HT6R ligands, the pharmacophore feature HYD is frequently represented by fused aromatic rings of a naphthalene or a halogen substituted benzene, an indole or a benzothiophene. A piperazine (un)substituted with methyl seems to be a most profitable moiety containing the feature PI. The feature HBA, occurring in a number of sulfonyl ligands, can also fit in the carbonyl moieties whereas the aromatic heterocyclic groups, e.g. a pyridine, a benzimidazole or a quinolone, form a benefit aromatic feature (AR, Fig. 1) that is desirable for interactions with the 5-HT6R [8].
On the other hand, our previous studies provided a series of 2-amino-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazine derivatives [9], [10], [11] that had been designed as potential histamine H4 receptor ligands. That aim was achieved in the case of derivatives with aryl rings directly substituted at the triazine, e.g. TR7 (1) [9], whereas the compounds with an aromatic moiety separated by the methylene group, e.g. TR20 (2) [11], displayed a weak action on the histamine H4 receptor with Ki values only in micromolar range (Fig. 2).Download : Download high-res image (81KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2.

During an analysis of structural properties of the 2,4,6-trisubstituted 1,3,5-triazines (1 and 2) some slight similarity to known selective 5-HT6R ligands, namely Ro 04–6790 [12], SB-271046 [13] or SB-399885 [14] (Fig. 3) can be noted as well as the triazine compounds (Fig. 2) imposed on 3 out of 4 features of the 5-HT6R pharmacophore model of López-Rodríguez.Download : Download high-res image (112KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 3. Structures and the receptor affinity of selected, first identified 5-HT6R ligands. The CNS MPO values were calculated using in-house script (see Experimental section).
Furthermore, precise search for structural similarities to the triazine compounds (1 and 2) among compounds deposited in ChEMBL v20 database confirmed that no triazine 5-HT6R ligand had been identified so far. The most similar 5-HT6R ligands contained the benzimidazole or the naphthalene core (see Supplementary Table 1S). Taking this into account, we decided to perform modelling studies and evaluate the group of 1,3,5-triazine compounds for their binding ability to this important protein target.
The preliminary in vitro studies have shown a very weak micromolar affinity for 5-HT6R in the case of a series of 19 aryl-triazine compounds with the aromatic ring directly linked to the triazine core (Modification A, Fig. 4). In contrary, a good 5-HT6R affinity (Ki = 96 nM) was observed for the methylene-spacer compound 2 (Modification B, Fig. 4).Download : Download high-res image (203KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 4. Identification of a lead structure 2 (TR20) for 1,3,5-triazine 5-HT6 ligands.
Hence, compound 2 has been selected as a lead structure for further modifications to give a new chemical group of 5-HT6R ligands with therapeutic perspectives. Here, we present the computer-aided design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation (in vitro and in vivo) as well as structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis supported by molecular modelling for the new generation of triazine 5-HT6R agents, including lead 2 and its 17 derivatives (2–19, Table 1).Table 1.
