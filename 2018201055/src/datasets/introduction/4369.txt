IT innovations, specifically high-powered computing and ubiquitous networking, have affected people’s lives, and private and public organizational activities, and will continue to change our society in dramatic ways. As technology advances, increasingly abundant digital data from online music social networks, Internet-of-things (IoT)-based sensors, set-top box and handset technologies in cable TV, and mobile phones can be more thoroughly studied with the help of various data analytics methods (IDC, 2009), including Computer Science (CS), Machine Learning (ML), Statistics, and Economics.1 These lead to new ways to understand people as individuals and in groups, organizations and their partnerships, and firms, industries and society as a whole (Carley, 2002, Anderson, 2008, Manyika et al., 2011, Agarwal and Dhar, 2014). The research inquiry approach that is discussed – fusion analytics – is a term that was coined in this and related research, to offer additional new ideas related to Computational Social Science (CSS). It builds on earlier data analytics research (IBM, 2012, Chang et al., 2014, Athey, 2015), and our past philosophy of science work related to the new approaches to big data research (Kauffman and Wood, 2007).
The contexts with big data that are explored are characterized by new opportunities for creating insights with declining costs and increasing technical leverage to accomplish the work. New ways of doing data analytics open up possibilities for innovative thinking and novel contributions to scientific discovery in interdisciplinary contexts (Davenport, 2006), where it is possible to bring different bodies of knowledge and different research approaches to bear in order to reveal interesting insights. Interdisciplinarity is critical in this context.2 By exploring cross-disciplinary issues, asking new questions, implementing new data collection approaches, and instantiating models that would not have been possible before, a policy analyst is able to come closer to empirical truths in applied settings that support large-scale data collection. This leads to increased relevance of the research and higher impacts. And yet, accomplishing such work in many organization settings is fraught with challenges, roadblocks, legal restrictions on data sharing, and very short delivery timelines when organizations are involved.
Although researchers in the past have tried to combine Computer Science, Psychology, Sociology, Regional Economics, Biostatistics, and other bodies of theory and methods knowledge to assert interdisciplinary solutions to leading problems, the perspectives they emphasized rarely were interdisciplinary.3 This article attempts to bring some of these knowledge bases together to address consumer, business and social issues. These are defined and discussed in Table 1, as a way to communicate to the reader that this is not a strict taxonomy, but instead a way of thinking about the kinds of research inquiries that can be undertaken.Table 1. Orientation to Business, Consumer and Social Insights Data Analytics Settings.Insights areaDefinitionRepresentative data analytics contextsBusinessData analytics can create a deeper understanding of the issues, situations, and contexts that offer potential of benefits.By business insights, analytics are involved in settings that are for-profit / not-for-profit, public / private, governmental and non-governmental, in operational, logistical, financial, human resources, strategy and industry settings.Insights can redirect mgmt’s thinking, guiding future decisions for better product / service design and quality, operational performance and productivity, risk mgmt and security, and market share, profitability and performance.Applicable across business disciplines, work groups, product lines, support services, strategic business units, organizations, firms, sectors and economy; can also include transactions, processes, economic exchange, business activities, managerial issues, and the dynamics of competition.-Stock market trade analytics-Churn rate analytics for telcos-Internet fraud detection-New product launch analytics-Resource allocation, planning-Inventory management-Faster payment and settlement-Banking product line design-Govt regulation change effects-Hotel room utilization-Emergency room services-Taxi fleet passenger pick-ups-Airline landing rights biddingConsumerData analytics can also reveal a deeper understanding of consumers, customers, users, medical patients, and decision-makers.By consumer insights, analytics are involved in settings with individuals, and the behaviors that they demonstrate. This area of analytics enhances the understanding of the analyst through close examination of people and their interactions with products, services, businesses, cities, and government and non-business organizations, including healthcare, legal and family services.Emphasizes consumption, consumer utility, consumer informedness and satisfaction; customer and patient centricity, individual wellness; auction bidding and group-buying behavior; decisions to buy, sell, participate; everything under the general umbrella of individual welfare; and not limited to or intended to be circumscribed by consumer behavior in retailing.-Fast-moving product turn-over-Movie box office performance-Product price change impacts-Consumer coupon redemption-Customer product returns-Customer channel management-Online, offline retail shopping-Credit card spending patterns-Personal loan defaults-Individual criminal recidivism-Home mortgage demand-Household waste recycling-Sharing-economy servicesSocialBig data analytics are concerned with peer-to-peer, social network and non-network relationships, social activities and events; urban and regional programs and policies; legal, law enforcement and political issues; elections and issues referenda, community and regional planning.By social insights, the connection is to analytics that produce deep knowledge into activities that are of a more aggregate nature than those that typically occur in business or consumer activities. In lieu of business value, the focus may shift to outcome measures such as environmental sustainability, water quality, community wellness, growth in regional real estate value, and social value of community programs.These issues can be studied well when the promulgation of a new program, policy, law or initiative creates a natural quasi-experiment treatment for those who are affected, and a control for those who are unaffected, with randomized instead of biased participation.Examine interactions related to and social issues among people in different segments (younger / older, or race / ethnicity / income), as well as among people of different educational and social status levels, with the aim of understanding and maximizing social welfare.Data come in various sources and forms, including social network, social media, blogging, human wellness, opinions, ratings and sentiment data.-Public social sentiment effects on candidates and elections-Social media influences in public election settings-Patterns of responses in situations of crisis involving publicly-available data-Notifications of weather events and problems to emergency services via social messaging-Online ratings and opinion analysis on consumer engagement for brands and healthcare services-Social opinions on sustainable development, linking economy, society and environment-Effects of social informedness on community recycling-Blogpost and tweet analytics to analyze public services quality
Big data enable new levels of sophistication for the study of settings in which technology meets consumer, business and social policy issues, facilitates social and civic empowerment, and enhances stakeholder participation in planning (Brabham, 2009). Data analytics can uncover business and social value from data, by permitting modeling, experimentation, simulation, and other scientific approaches to discover new knowledge. But it is also necessary to identify what kinds of analytics methods can be used from different disciplines, what new knowledge can be discovered regarding the issues at hand, as well as where the data will come from and how it can be collected. Some applied contexts that are appropriate can be identified based on the popular press, and government agency calls for research.4
Organizations have been implementing big data projects and deploying new ways of discovering market, product and consumer knowledge. They also have reported new opportunities to obtain informational advantages for the conduct of their businesses, compared to their prior reliance on traditional marketing research methods (Granados et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2016, Li et al., 2017). According to IBM (2012), every field is being changed by the large amount of data available.5 And increasingly, there has been a desire to find consistency in the methods and inquiry approaches that are used in organizations to achieve high quality, policy-relevant information (Kenett and Shmueli, 2017).
Current technologies and others that are emerging hold out the promise to offer astonishingly rich details concerning human and social activities, contextual patterns of behavior, and the attitudes, preferences, and sentiment of different individuals and groups (Gondecha and Lieu, 2012). The related research examined how people use big data to derive valuable results. Data analytics support finding repetitive patterns and adjusting predictive models to understand how likely it is to observe various behaviors. And yet, as Shmueli (2010) has pointed out, it is important to distinguish between data analytics intended to deliver explanatory information versus predictive information. A recent trend is to use statistical Machine Learning, which complements traditional Econometrics (Athey, 2015). When Machine Learning is combined with Econometrics, authors often construct dependent and independent variables with the help of machine-based analytics routines and algorithms, and this sets up the use of modeling structures and error term specification. Researchers working on electronic commerce have also begun to use this approach (Lee et al., 2016, Shi et al., 2016).
This article is intended to encourage researchers, analysts and doctoral students to apply interdisciplinary fusion analytics research approaches to achieve useful new results. For example, they include pattern recognition for data and other modes of machine-based discovery to create large datasets, with explanatory analysis that yields insights into the marginal impacts of different policies through the variables that represent them. This also makes it possible to do counterfactual impact analysis (Mohr, 1995, Lewis, 2001, Larkey, 2015, Science and Knowledge Service, 2016). Counterfactual analysis is about simulating what the marginal effects of policy interventions may be by considering what may happen in its presence versus its absence, based on the data analytics techniques available to discover this.6 This allows analytics to produce more managerial insights, and build powerful evidence to understand business, consumer and social policies. This also is often a matter of what researchers bring to research designs that they implement.
Section 2 discusses the interdisciplinary roots of the fusion analytics research approach, and presents a new framework to capture the essential elements of the different research approaches that have been identified. Section 3 provides additional background on the importance of data analytics, and the rise of techniques that evaluate the digital traces of human behavior in different contexts and provide various means of network analysis and information visualization. Sections 4 Mobile phone-based stock trading, 5 Music semantics and the duration of music track popularity, 6 Preferences in household TV viewing, 7 Household content sampling and video-on-demand purchases then illustrate the fusion analytics approach with applications involving large datasets that are analyzed with machine-based methods, statistics, and econometrics. Finally, Section 8 offers a concluding discussion that evaluates what has been learned in this research, and the various tactics that are required for achieving analytics success with big data and Computational Social Science research designs.
