A network of interconnected nodes is a natural representation of complex systems [1], [2], [3]. Several networks with different types of nodes can be further connected through interdependencies, which are one-to-one or one-to-many relationships among nodes in different networks, and form interdependent networks [4], [5]. The study of interdependent networks is particularly challenging due to the complexity of mixed structural and dynamical properties.
Topological evolution is an important feature of complex networks. Numerous spontaneous structural evolution phenomena have been observed in natural and social networks [6], [7], [8], and some models have been proposed [9], [10]. The causes of network topological evolution are commonly associated with network dynamics, such as percolation, spreading, and synchronization. In return, topological evolution can also affect network dynamical processes. The two-way mutual interaction between dynamical processes and topological evolution is referred to as adaptive evolution in networks [11]. The notion of adaptation between dynamical processes and topological evolution has been studied for both simplex and multiplex networks [12], [13] and for the interconnection layers in interdependent networks [14].
Apart from the topological adaptation to dynamical processes, the topological evolution of a network, e.g., addition or removal of nodes or edges, can also be caused by the change in the topology of its interdependent networks. This evolution, in return, could also result in topological adaptation in its interdependent networks. This adaptive topological coevolution phenomenon between interdependent networks, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, has not been thoroughly discussed except for some case studies [15].
Scientific collaboration and citation networks are a typical example of a pair of interdependent networks that are both constantly evolving [16]. A scientific collaboration network can be constructed from the co-authorships among scientists [17]. Such networks evolve with new authors added and collaborations formed each year. On the other hand, a paper citation network is a directed simplex network with a number of new publications added annually, referencing previous publications [18]. The interdependencies between scientific collaboration and citation networks are the authorship of papers. The topological evolution of one network naturally influences the evolution of the other: the formation of a new collaboration could result in a future citation from one collaborator to another; while one scientist citing papers from another could also lead to a seek of collaboration between the two.
Motivated by the above observation and progress in the study of interdependent networks, this work first focuses on discovering the adaptive topological coevolution phenomenon in the interdependent scientific collaboration and citation networks formed using a dataset of more than 250,000 academic papers spanning over 50 years. Then, a computational framework is proposed to model this phenomenon. It is demonstrated that the proposed adaptive topological coevolution framework is effective and, indeed, critical to replicating the observed phenomenon from empirical data. Finally, the article is concluded by discussing how this framework may provide a new viewpoint of understanding the complex nature of other interconnected systems.
