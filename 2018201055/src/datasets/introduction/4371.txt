Field of application of supercritical (SC) fluid technologies is continually expanding in the last decades. One of lots of directions is the use of SC fluid extraction for the quantitative determination of antioxidants and preservatives in cosmetic products for the purpose of safety control [1].
Parabens, including methylparaben (MP) and propylparaben (PP), are popular preservatives applied actually to all types of cosmetics, and to a lot of food and pharmaceuticals for inhibiting the growth of microorganisms. The advantages of parabens are the following: a broad range of activity, inertness and low cost. Their toxicity is considered to be low due to the rapid hydrolysis in vivo to the parent acid (para-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-HBA), which is rapidly conjugated and excreted.
Nevertheless, the question of the safety of using parabens remains unsolved. It was proved that they have a raised estrogenic activity, leading to the development of cancer [2]. Acceptable standards for the use of parabens are regularly reassessed and reduced. Nowadays, the maximum (total or individual) permissible parabens concentration by European standards of 2014 is 0.0014 mass fraction, expressed as p-HBA. In order to protect consumer health quantification methods for simultaneous analytical monitoring are been developed for the proper use of antioxidants and preservatives in cosmetics. SC fluid extraction is applied as one of the most effective methods for the isolation of solutes from solid samples [1].
Parabens and p-HBA solubilities in SC CO2 in various parts of phase diagram are studied in a series of publications [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Literature data for solubility at T = 328 K (the temperature at which three compounds were investigated: p-HBA, MP and PP) are compared illustratively in Fig. 1a. It is found that the parabens solubilities are 2 orders of magnitude higher than the p-HBA solubility, and PP solubility at P ∼20 MPa is approximately twice as high as of MP solubility. Unfortunately, there is almost no information in the literature about the effect of polar cosolvents capable of forming hydrogen bonds (HBs) with a solute. The only found data are obtained for PP at T = 308 K, with acetone at concentration of 0.035 mol fraction as the co-solvent. They are compared with PP solubility in pure SC CO2 at the same temperature in Fig. 1b. PP solubility in the presence of acetone is several times as high as in pure solvent.Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Solubility Y in SC CO2 according to literature data. a) 328 K, in pure SC CO2: 1 – p-HBA [7], 2 – MP [3], 3 – PP [5], 4 – PP [6]; b) 308 K: 1 – PP in pure SC CO2 [6], 2 – PP in acetone-modified (0.035 mol fraction) SC CO2 [6].
As it is shown by studies of substances similar to p-HBA and parabens, the use of low molecular weight alcohols for increasing solubility in SC CO2 is more effective than using acetone [8], [9], [10]. The cause of solubility increasing is a selective solvation of solute molecules by cosolvent due to the formation of stable HBs [11], [12], [13].
In this paper, the molecular mechanism of p-HBA, MP and PP solvation in methanol-modified SC CO2 (0.03 mol fraction of methanol) at T = 328 K and ρ = 0.772 g/cm3, corresponding to the experimental pressure of 21.3 MPa, is studied using computer simulation. We have considered the probability of hydrogen bonding between solute and cosolvent, the distribution of the HBs by the solute functional groups, the duration of the HBs existence. On the base of these characteristics the selective solvation of p-HBA and parabens by methanol molecules and its features, depending on the length of the alkyl group have been studied.
