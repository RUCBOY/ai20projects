The concept of grill topological spaces, which is grounded on two operators, is Φ and Ψ. Choquet [1] was the first introduced this concept. It has been found out that there is some of similarity between Choquat concept and that ideals, nets and filters. A number of theories and features has been handled in [2], [3], [4], [5]. It helps to expand the topological structure which is used to measure the description rather than quantity, such as love, intelligence, beauty, quality of education and etc. Also, it expands the topological structure by using the concept of grill changes in lower approximation, upper approximation and boundary region, which opens up new horizons in Nano topological spaces. In 1970, Levine [6] was the first author to introduce the idea of expansion closed sets. The idea of Nano topological structure is grounded on lower, upper and boundary approximations of a subset of an universe set with an equivalence relation on it. Also, it helps to introduce definition of closed, interior and closure set via concept of Nano . In 2013, Lellis [7] was the first to develop this idea. This research objectives are to insert grill in Nano generalized closed between Nano topology on the space. Some of important relations are obtained.
