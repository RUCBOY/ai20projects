Model problems containing differential and integral equations have played an important role broadly in mathematics, physics, biology and engineering since their early years. It is usually hard to find the analytical solutions of these problems. Therefore, efficient numerical methods investigating the behavior of the approximate solutions have been introduced. Some of which are the matrix collocation based on the polynomials [25], [26], [20], [48], [3], [47], Adomian's decomposition [2], He's homotopy perturbation [21] and He's variational iteration methods [22]. The permutation Dickson polynomials [17], [10] we will employ in this study for a matrix method contain a parameter-α. For more consistency in approximations, we can change a obtained solution by means of this parameter.
Our aim in this study is to efficiently and rapidly solve some widely-used model problems, by obtaining the Dickson polynomial solutions approaching to the exact solution of these problems. As well as using the different parameter-α in the Dickson polynomial solutions, we also investigate the convergence of these solutions via the residual function in Banach space. The general form of some model problems we will consider in this study can be written as(1)L[y(t)]+N[y(t)]=g(t),a≤t≤b, whereL[y(t)]=∑r=0mPr(t)y(r)(t)andN[y(t)]=∑s=12∑v=02Qsv(t)ys(t)y(v)(t),s=v≠2, subject to the mixed conditions(2)∑k=0m−1aiky(k)(a)+biky(k)(b)=ηi,i=0,1,…,m−1, where m is the order of Eq. (1). We find the Dickson polynomial solution of Eq. (1) in the form [25], [26]:(3)y(t)≅yN(t)=∑n=0NynDn(t,α) where yn (n=0,1,…,N) are unknown Dickson coefficients and we employ the collocation points in the matrices and their calculations(4)ti=a+(b−aN)i,i=0,1,2,…,N,a=t0<t1<…<tN=b.
