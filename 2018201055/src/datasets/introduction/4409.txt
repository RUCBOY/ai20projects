Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by demyelinated plaques with gliosis and inflammatory infiltrates that mainly consist of lymphocytes and mononuclear phagocytes in central nervous system (CNS).1 Although MS was first recognized in the19th century, the cause of the disease remains a mystery, but it appears to involve a combination of genetic and non-genetic factors that together result in a self-sustaining autoimmune disorder that leads to recurrent immune attacks on the CNS.2, 3
MS affects more than 2.3 million people worldwide and mainly young adults with a predominance of females.4 It is one of the most common neurological disorders but there is still no complete cure for MS, and it remains entirely non-treatable disease with no effective treatment. Currently, the goals of MS treatment include decreasing their frequency, shortening the duration of acute exacerbations and providing symptomatic relief and so Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies for MS are not curative.1 Fingolimod (FTY720) was endorsed by the United States FDA in September 2010 as the first oral treatment for MS. FTY720 reduced the number of lesions and clinical disease activity in patients with MS but has revealed side effects such as associated with an initial reduction in the heart rate and asymptomatic elevations of alanine aminotransferase.5 Therefore, pharmaceutical companies and scientists are still searching for new drug candidates that are more effective than existing drugs and have fewer side effects.
In this context, our aim was the development of structurally novel hS1P1R agonists with a potential use as therapeutic agents against MS. To this end, a virtual library of synthetically accessible fingolimod derivatives has been designed. Subsequently, docking studies have been performed using crystal structures of hS1P1R to identify derivatives that were expected to show high affinity and these compounds were then synthesized. The chemical syntheses of F1-12h and F2-9 have been carried to achieve the intended goals. After confirming the purity and identity of the synthesized product, it was to analyze the impact of FTY720 and its derivatives on multiple sclerosis and G-Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCRs) signaling pathway profiles of SH-SY5Y, SK-N-SH, and U-118 MG cells. Therefore, the data obtained from these studies have been a help to understand the disease by giving an opportunity for the identification novel molecular targets.
