Magnetoelectric (ME) and multiferroic materials are gaining increasing attention from the fundamental and applied points of view [1], [2]. Multiferroic materials show two (or all three) of the so-called ‘ferroic’ properties (ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism and ferroelasticity). ME coupling describes the influence of a magnetic (electric) field on the polarization (magnetization) of a material and, in ME composites, it appears indirectly via strain/stress. Generally, the ME response of a material is described by the ME voltage coefficient (αME), defined as [1]:(1)αME=δPδHwhere αME represents the change of the electrical polarization, P, induced under application of a magnetic field, H.
There are single phase multiferroic materials [3], but their ME performance is low and typically appears at low temperatures [4]. In order to improve these properties, ME composites arise as a solution. In this context, composites based on magnetostrictive (MS) and piezoelectric (PE) phases provide the best ME systems for technological applications and, in fact, several applications are being developed on the basis of these composite materials [5]. The use of ME materials will allow a wide range of applications, including electrically controlled microwave phase shifters, magnetically controlled electro-optic or piezoelectric devices, broadband magnetic field sensors and memory devices, among others. For the materials to be technologically useful a larger ME coupling must be achieved and, therefore, large efforts are being devoted to develop composites with higher ME coupling than single phase materials [6].
Thus, ceramic and polymer-based ME composites have been developed, each one with specific advantages and disadvantages. Ceramic-based composites exhibit ME coefficients up to three orders of magnitude higher than polymer-based materials, but they show limitations due the reactions at the interface regions, causing high dielectric losses and affecting their stability on device applications [1]. On the other hand, polymer-based ME materials show a good strain coupling and are stable over time. Further, polymer-based ME material show flexibility, can be shaped in a variety of forms, can be fabricated at low temperature and, in some cases, are biocompatible [7].
Polymer-based ME materials have been fabricated as laminates or nanocomposites. Laminates show a higher ME coefficient, with differences up to four orders of magnitude. Nanocomposites do not show degradation at the interface, their fabrication is simpler as well as their miniaturization [8].
Low dimensional structures are increasingly being developed and studied due to their particular mechanical, electrical, magnetic and optical properties when compared with the bulk ones [9], [10].
Suitable characterization of functional low scale ME nanocomposites is often not possible due to the difficulty of the direct ME measurements, the necessity of measuring a wide range of magnetic fields and the need of study high particle concentration effects [11], [12]. Thus, the use of mathematical models and simulations are an interesting and viable option for the proper understanding, evaluation and optimization of the ME response of these low-scale structures [12].
Thus, this work reports on simulations of the ME effect at the interface between magnetostrictive and piezoelectric materials in low dimensional polymer based ME spheres [11]. Poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, was selected as piezoelectric component due to its high piezoelectric response, large chemical and radiation resistance [13], [14]. The magnetostrictive CoFe2O4, CFO, material was selected based on its large magnetostriction, high Curie temperature, and chemical resistance [11], [15].
The ME response was evaluated with varying magnetic field, CFO content and sphere diameter.
