Hyperlinks, also known as anchors or <a> HTML tags, are the primary mode of navigation on the web [1]. They connect web objects in a web site and allow users to navigate from the current page to another site on the Internet [2], [3], thus allowing web designers to organize the data on web pages in different ways [4], according to the main purpose of the site or the target audience.
Different techniques have been proposed for linking elements between web pages [5], [6], [7], but the most discussed have been access keys [8]. However, this method cannot be used on touchscreen mobile devices due to the fact that shortcuts are implemented using a XHTML attribute (called ‘accesskey’) that only works with 0–9, * and # keys of hardware keyboards [9], so they can only be used in a few current mobile browsers. However, when they work in a mobile browser, this alternative can be used in combination with hyperlinks because it can provide shortcuts to expert users, but in this case they have to be designed in such a way that they do not confuse non-expert users and encourage number pressing [5]. Anyway, users should always be able to navigate with hyperlinks when they are using mobile devices [5], and hyperlinks have been proved to be the easiest way to navigate in mobile web sites [6], so using them should be enough and more attention should be paid to their usability.
Hyperlinks are one of the top 10 key factors influencing webpage design [10], and represent about 50% of web interactions [11]. On the other hand, the number of web users is increasing, as well as the number of mobile users, so studying the usability of hyperlinks is crucial in order to facilitate the Internet navigation, especially through these devices. According to Nakamoto [12], hyperlinks are highly suitable for improving user interfaces in smart devices, but studies carried out for Personal Computer (PC) interfaces about hyperlinks may not be applicable to this kind of devices because the number of hyperlinks displayed on a desktop PC within a single screen or page is higher than the number of hyperlinks that can be displayed on a mobile device [13]. Because of this, it is necessary to study the usability of hyperlinks in mobile devices separately from the usability of hyperlinks in PCs.
There are two main factors to be studied about hyperlinks, which are complementary and influence the efficiency of navigation and, therefore, their usability: the design of links and the structure of links [14], [15], [16]. The former includes the appearance of links, such as their style or location on the web pages, as well as their content [17]; and the latter refers to how hyperlinks connect the documents on the web [18]. In this paper we focus on the visual aspects of the hyperlinks, so the literature review will address this topic.
This paper shows a strict process of analysis and evaluation to contribute with guidelines for designing hyperlinks in mobile devices in order to improve their usability. This process consists of (1) an evaluation of usability guidelines for detecting which of the traditional navigation guidelines could be applied to mobile devices; and (2) empirical experimentation for validating these guidelines and proposing new or adapted navigation guidelines for mobile browsers.
Section 2 presents the related work to this paper, Section 3 describes the first stage of the method carried out (i.e., selection of guidelines), and Section 4 explains the experimentation and results. Section 5 proposes the new guidelines about hyperlinks for mobile devices, Section 6 shows a discussion about our results compared to prior research and finally Section 7 exhibits the conclusions.
