For centuries, the development of material science (old saying as metallurgy) mainly relies on the experience based on the experiment, then come the general theories such as the law of thermodynamics. The advancement of computer hardwares and softwares implementing the density functional theory and molecular dynamics, etc, leads to the computer simulation era of material science. The emergence of the big data technology facilitates the shift of the material science to the fourth paradigm, i.e., the data-driven stage [1]. The coming of the data-driven material science presents a very promising and inspiring pathway for the faster and more cost-efficient design and deployment of advanced materials compared to the traditional trial-and-error method. For the data-driven paradigm of material science, construction of relevant infrastructures is clearly needed, which has been greatly promoted by the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) launched in 2011 [2]. In recent years, following the route presented in MGI, the development of computational tools and their applications in materials design are springing up [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. A general material design platform combining the data generation, data management and data mining is very desirable for the material designers with wide backgrounds.
Extensive efforts have been put on the frameworks or codes development considering the high-throughput calculation (HTC) [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], material data management [21], [22], [23] and machine learning in materials science [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30]. Materials Project [31] is a well-known pioneer for HTC in material science, and its frameworks including Pymatgen [32], FireWorks [33], Custodian [34], and Atomate [35] which enable the automatic computation are now widely used in the community. AFLOWÏ€ [36] is another minimalist framework for high-throughput first-principles calculations, which supports the data generation, error control, curation and archiving of the data, and post-processing tools for analysis and visualization. AiiDA (automated interactive infrastructure and database) [37] is also an open-source python infrastructure to help researchers with automating, managing, persisting, sharing and reproducing the complex workflows associated with modern computational science and data. In addition, there are also other codes or platforms, such as Atom simulation environment (ASE) [38], Pylada [39], Imeall [40] and MPInterfaces [41], have been developed for HTC. Meanwhile, the online material databases expand very fast in recent years, benefiting from the application of HTC. Examples of such databases are the Materials Project [31], OQMD (Open Quantum Materials Database) [42], AFLOWLIB consortium (Automatic Flow Lib) [43], [44], NOMAD [45], ICSD (Inorganic experimental) [46], COD [47], CMR (ASE-database) [48] and Materials Cloud [37], etc. The rapidly increasing and easily available data in these depositories make the application of the data mining via machine leaning (ML) possible. In addition to the general ML codes such as scikit-learn [49], TensorFlow [50] and PyTorch [51], a few other codes have been developed specifically for material science with the general ML codes included as the engines. For examples, AFLOW-ML [52] is a representational-state-transfer-architecture API for machine-learning predictions of materials properties; SISSO [53], written in FORTRAN 90, is a compressed-sensing method for identifying the best low-dimensional descriptor in an immensity of offered candidates; MatMiner [54] is another platform to facilitate data-driven methods for analyzing and predicting materials properties based on scikit-learn. In addition, there are many other machine learning tools used for specific fields in material science, for example, PROphet [55], COMBO [56], Magpie [57] and JARVIS-ML [58], etc.
As far as we know, most of the MGI related codes are designed for one or two of the three components which are the generation, management and mining of the data in the data-driven materials design. Here we introduce a general computational platform ALKEMIE (Artificial Learning and Knowledge Enhanced Materials Informatics Engineering), which works like a normal application software while covers all of the three components of the data flow. ALKEMIE has incorporated many well-known open-source processing tools, computation engines at different length/time scales, etc, and more importantly, it is equipped with a very friendly graphical user interface which makes the workflow and dataflow more manageable and transparent. Moreover, ALKEMIE is greatly enhanced by a well-designed module for machine-learned interatomic potential generation, which bridges the first-principles calculations and classic molecular dynamics simulations.
This paper is organized as follows. Firstly, the main features of ALKEMIE are presented in Section 2. Next, in Section 3, we describe the design philosophy and architecture of ALKEMIE. In Section 4, the core modules in ALKEMIE are introduced in detail. Finally, in Section 5, three examples are used to demonstrate the main features of ALKEMIE: high-throughput first-principles calculation with 103 tasks, screening of the easily alloying elements in copper in terms of the formation energy of the alloyed system, and the generation of the machine-learned interatomic potential for Sb.
