In the last decades, electrochemistry has been fundamental to understand ionic adsorption on metal electrodes [1], [2], [3], [4]. Voltammetry is one of the most commonly used electrochemical techniques, which enables the study of mechanisms associated with electrochemical processes, charge transfer and adsorption on modified surfaces[5], [6]. The electroactive species may be adsorbed on the electrode surface and lateral interactions between them can induce the formation of ordered structures. In this regard, Wandlowski and col. have reported an order-disorder phase transition for the adsorption of Bromide on Ag(001) [7].
Many thermodynamics and statistical mechanics concepts have been applied in recent years to electrochemical processes; and various methodologies, involving solutions of mathematical equations and stochastic simulations, have been developed to interpret and solve the specific issue of voltammetry [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. In particular, the development of methodologies including digital simulations has been widely developed in this field [13], [14], [15].
In regard to the model, the metal–electrolyte interface can be interpreted by a two-dimensional system, where anionic species, ions or molecules interact with a metallic solid. This area has been one of the most studied by experimental measurements, and theoretical and computational methods. Several electrochemical systems have been analyzed from first principle techniques, such as the adsorption of H on Pt(111) and Pt(100), [16]. In particular, cyclic voltammetry and electrosorption isotherms, based on density functional theory calculations, show excellent agreement with experimental results.
One of the strategies used to mimic the electrochemical processes involves Monte Carlo (MC) simulations [17], [18], in which the electrode surface is approximated by a lattice-gas model. This model is characterized by a substrate having specific sites where the adsorbate can be deposited [19]. An interesting example of application is represented by the study of the adsorption of bromide on Ag(100), in which MC and Mean Field Approximation have been used to fit the experimental isotherm, taking into account long and short-range interactions [20], [21]. Other experimental techniques, like choronocoulometry, have been simulated by MC, for example the electrodeposition study of Br on Ag(100) [22], [23].
MC has been also applied in the case of small dimensions systems such as nanoparticles. For example, surface decorations on several nanoparticles geometries have been analyzed using the compressibility of monolayer or the derivative of the adsorption isotherms that is related with current in voltammetric studies [24].
Several energetic approaches, such as truncated-sum and mean-field-enhanced were used in order to fit experimental isotherms based on chronocoulometric data for the electrosorption of Br and Cl on Ag(100) [25]. In these systems theoretical approximations such as Mean-Field and Quasi-Chemical have been developed to obtain cyclic voltammograms [26].
Another numerical tool widely used to study the electrosorption process is MC dynamic. This method is characterized by considering time as a parameter; therefore it is possible to analyze the kinetics of the process under study. Abou Hamad et. al. [27] have used a dynamic lattice model for Br on Ag(100), and the strategy involved the adjustment of the MC attempt frequency. They found good agreement between simulated and experimental peak separations. Otherwise, the electro-oxidation of CO on stepped electrodes [28] and the kinetics of CO oxidation on Pt(100) and Pt(111) surfaces, assuming a Langmuir–Hinshelwood mechanism, were studied with this methodology by Koper and col. [29].
In this work, we propose a simple model to emulate qualitatively the main characteristics of the electrosorption phenomenon in a real modified surface. Although all physicochemical process involved in the oxidation of Fe[CN6]4- are not included in this model, the results show that it is able to reproduce the electrochemical parameters behavior.
In particular we are interested in consider the effect on the charge transfer of a redox species, when a second non-electroactive species, which interacts with the redox one, is previously deposited on the electrode surface. This phenomenon will be analyzed by two methods: Standard Monte Carlo simulation and linear sweep voltammetry.
The experimental voltammograms were performed on a glassy carbon electrode (GCE) modified with Laponite particles. Laponite is synthetic clay with composition and structure similar to those of natural, trioctahedral smectite clay minerals [30]. In particular, laponite crystals have a negative surface charge of 50-55 mmol.100 g-1. Crystal edges have small localized positive charges (4-5 mmol.100 g-1) as a result of the absorption of cations. A surface which is modified with this clay acquires a net negative charge density. [Fe(CN)6]4- is a commonly redox mediator used in electrochemical characterization of electrode surfaces due to its electron transfer kinetics has been extensively studied [31]. In the present work, this redox species was used to assess the effect of electrostatic interactions in the electronic transfer and thus obtained voltammetric response.
In previous work, we found that negative electrostatic interactions between the clay and the [Fe(CN)6]4- are observed. These interactions were tested both by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) [32], [33] and they have reflected in an increase in the charge transfer resistance (EIS), a decrease in the peak current (CV) and a shift of the peak potential towards higher ones (CV).
The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the lattice-gas model and details of Monte Carlo Simulations are presented. Section 3 describes the solutions and reagents, while Section 4 details the characteristics of the electrochemical measurements. Results and discussion are presented in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 6.
