Up to Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, symmetric key cryptography was a base for pairing, where both devices shared the identical PIN (Personal Identification Number) code [5]. Later in Bluetooth 2.1+EDR, a fresh pairing mechanism named Secure Simple Pairing (SSP) is introduced, intended to improve security in piconet and scatter net [6]. Unlike Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, SSP in Bluetooth 2.1+EDR exploits Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) public-key cryptography in its pairing protocol. Ever since, during pairing researchers observed and introduced many attacks. In addition, researchers too utilized elliptic curve method to improve the Bluetooth pairing algorithm. In today's scenario, standard and classical computers employing elliptic curve cryptosystems are secure, because the inverse of the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves is liable to be unbreakable [19] than the traditional Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) [8]. Nevertheless, the same is not true for future quantum computers [26].
Lattice-based cryptographic constructions hold a great promise for post-quantum cryptography, as they enjoy very strong security proofs based on worst-case hardness [2], [15]. Thus, a quantum resistance pairing protocol for quantum computers using Lattice-Based Ring Learning With Errors (R-LWE), named as Classiquantum Resistance Secure Simple Pairing (CRSSP) is proposed over existing SSP. Implementing enhanced security measures, such as those, which have been proposed here, would reduce the security risks of current pairing protocol.
This paper is organized as follows in sections wherein, in Section 2, SSP with numeric comparison mode and Lattice-based cryptography for quantum computers is discussed. Proposed Bluetooth pairing protocol CRSSP and its advantages over SSP are discussed in Section 3 and 4 respectively followed by results and discussion in Section 5. Finally, concluded the paper in Section 6.
