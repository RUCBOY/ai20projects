Carnosine (β-alanine-l-histidine) known as an enigmatic dipeptide is an effective anti-ageing compound [1]. Forming of carbonyl groups in proteins due to the oxidation and reduction induces cellular ageing [2], [3]. Protein carbonyl groups are resulted from oxidation [2], glycation [4], reaction with malondialdehyde [5], methylglyoxal [6], and finally with glycolytic intermediates [7].
During glycation (which happened simultaneously with ageing), some molecules attach to proteins. These unusual proteins might build up forming agents that could react with free radicals to degenerate diseases associated with ageing. It has been found that carnosine possess considerable anti-glycating properties [8], [9] and also a strong antioxidant property [10], [11], [12]. Carnosine characters cause it to encompass several clinical applications to mention some; anti-tumor actions [13] and delay ATP obtain ability to cancer cells [14]. Carnosine has been utilized by several kids with “Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder” (ADHD) [15], education problems [17] and autism [16]. Another application of carnosine is in the age-related skin creams. Creams including it have been used as a cosmetic to avoid or treat wrinkle forming mechanism [18]. The other properties of carnosine are membrane receptor alleviation and anti-apoptotic actions. Therefore it has significant neuron protective actions. Carnosine protects the action of neurons during stroke models [19].
Carnosine displays neuron protection, especially in Alzheimer's dementia. It protects against neuronal cell loss via a weakening of oxidation process [20].
The existence of an enzyme with the ability to hydrolyze the peptide bond in carnosine was first demonstrated by Hanson and Smith [21]. They named the enzyme carnosinase (or β-Ala-His dipeptidase), and classified it as metalloproteases. Two isoforms of carnosinase have been characterized, a cytosolic form (that named tissue carnosinase, and being strongly inhibited by bestatin) [22] and serum carnosinase [23] (that characterized by its distribution in the plasma and brain [24]). Usually, carnosinase acts rapidly and dwindle the serum levels of carnosine, thus reduces its clinical efficiency. Joining carnosine to a transporter can shield it against carnosinase degradation.
Development of new and efficient drug delivery systems has impact on improving the pharmacological science. One of those substances consists of Carbon nanotube (CNT) which has appeared as an efficient choice for carrying molecules. CNTs have recently become promising materials in various biological applications such as drug delivery [25], [26], [27], [28], tumor therapy [29], biosensors [30]. Two limitations of CNTs usage in biological systems are their low solubility and toxicity [31]. However, there are a number of conflicting reports about toxicity of CNTs. Several groups of investigations have reported toxic effects, while others demonstrate very low or insignificant cellular responses. This contradiction is related to usage of varying types of CNTs, different preparation and purification procedures, evaluation methods, and even different exposure conditions. Many factors such as impurities, chemical and structural characteristics (surface modification, shape, length, agglomeration, or layer numbers) can affect CNT toxicity [32].
The surrounding environment is another important factor for evaluating CNT toxicity. As a consequence of low solubility, CNTs usually deposit on the cell surface without proper dispersion in the biological systems and generate some health concerns [33]. Moreover, CNTs tend to aggregate due to their insolubility and therefore such toxicological responses are not surprising.
In fact, the solubility of CNTs in aqueous solutions is a precondition for biocompatibility, so CNT derivatives in therapeutic delivery should meet this basic prerequisite. Furthermore CNT dispersions should be uniform and stable to attain accurate concentration information.
The hydrophobic character of CNTs, together with the strong interactions between the individual tubes causing CNT assembles, reduce their solubility. Solubility under physiological conditions is an important problem to work, in a compatible biological medium. Therefore in the first step, applicability of CNTs as drug delivery system is related to their solubility and wet ability in aqueous environments. Non-functionalized CNTs are poorly soluble in water [34].
Surface functionalization increases the solubility of nanotubes [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. A theoretical study of functionalization effects on the solubility of nanotubes has shown modifications in their properties due to the functionalization with some organic molecules [43]. Among various species, functionalization of nanotubes with nucleic acids and proteins improves the solubility in aqueous solution, hence alleviates the application of nanotubes in biotechnology and biomedicine. Theoretical studies on functionalized NTs with DNA bases [44] indicate the augmentation of solubility of nanotubes in water.
CNT can be functionalized with peptides, proteins, drugs, and exploited as a drug delivery system. Since functionalized CNTs display low toxicity and are not immunogenic, such systems have a great potential in the field of nanomedicine [45], [46], [47].
It was shown that CNTs can be used as templates to transport bioactive peptides to immune system [48]. Functionalization CNT with natural bio molecules have been made to improve the nanotube solubility and a significant reduction on toxicity and biocompatibility [49]. Functionalization change the CNT structure to attainable component of therapeutic agent appropriate for clinical use. Immunization studies using the CNT-peptide in mice reveal that no antibodies are produced against functionalized CNT [50]. This issue suggests that carbon nanotubes would not possess essential immunogenicity and CNT-peptide can be considered as a biocompatible system.
The immunogenic structures of peptide–CNT are stable [51], [52]. Additional studies have shown that phenylalanine has an important role in enhancement of the adsorption of the peptides on the CNTs [53]. Peptide function has opened a new scope in discussion of biological properties of CNTs. In fact CNTs can be functionalized with peptides to transport them into different types of cells [54]. Moreover interaction of peptide drugs with CNTs as a drug deliver can enhance the solubility and biocompatibility of CNTs. In fact, functionalization of CNTs by these drugs can achieve both two aims. Therefore, investigation of the interaction of carnosine dipeptide as a drug with CNT, and the stability and solubility of the compounds were the aim of this study. Solvation free energies of complexes of CNT with carnosine dipeptide were studied in order to evaluate the effect of binding of dipeptide with CNT on solvation.
Solvation free energy is the free energy differences when a molecule is transferred from gas phase to solvent. The solvation energies of nanotubes are unattainable experimentally due to problems of low volatility. Therefore, application of computational methods may be the best approach to achieve the solvation behavior of these nanomaterials. These methods have extensive applicability in studies of absolute solvation free energies and binding free energies. The importance of computational method is not only reproduce experimental results but also gain insight of probability of the interactions. Moreover, the important usage of theoretical methods is in cases where experiments cannot be performed.
Despite biological interest there is not enough detailed theoretical study of interactions of CNTs with proteins and peptides.
In this paper we investigated the interaction of CNT and carnosine dipeptide in gas phase and aqueous solution. Quantum mechanical calculations were used to estimate the interaction energies in gas phase which followed by the Monte Carlo simulation of the structures in aqueous media in the following section. Biocompatibility of functionalized CNTs was then determined. Applicability of CNTs as drug delivery system is related to their solubility and wet ability in aqueous environments. Therefore, it is vital to verify the solvation of CNT in physiological media after functionalization with carnosine. Perturbation methods were used to compute solvation free energies and evaluate the solubility of the complexes. To mention more, complexation free energies of carnosine-CNT complexes were computed to evaluate the stability of the structures.
