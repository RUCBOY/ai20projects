The application of molecular structure descriptors is nowadays a standard procedure in the study of structure-property relations, especially in QSPR/QSAR study. In the last few years, the number of proposed molecular descriptors is rapidly growing due to the chemical significance of these descriptors. These descriptors correlate certain chemical and physical properties of chemical compounds. A close correlation of Randić index to the boiling point and Kovats constants has been found. A good model for the stability of linear and branched alkanes as well as the strain energy of cycloalkanes is provided by the atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index. For certain physico-chemical properties like boiling point, Entropy, Enthalpy of vaporization, Standard enthalpy of vaporization, Enthalpy of formation and Acentric factor, the predictive power of geometric-arithmetic (GA) index is better than predictive power of the Randić connectivity index [8]. Topological characterization of chemical structures allows the classification of molecules and modelling unknown structures with desired properties. Molecules and molecular compounds are often modeled by molecular graphs. A model that is used to characterize a chemical compound is called chemical graph. A molecular graph is a representation of the structural formula of a chemical compound in terms of graph theory, whose vertices correspond to the atoms of the compound and edges correspond to chemical bonds. The combination of chemistry, mathematics and information science which studies QSAR/QSPR relationships is known as cheminformatics. Many chemical and physical properties of the chemical compounds can be found with the help of QSAR /QSPR models. The topological indices such as Wiener index, Szeged index, Randić index, Zagreb indices and ABC index are used to correlate different chemical and physical properties like the boiling point, molecular weight, vapour pressure, π-electrom energy etc.
A molecular graph can be described by different ways such as, a drawing, a polynomial, a sequence of numbers, a matrix or by a derived number called a topological index . A topological index is a numeric quantity associated with a graph which characterizes the topology of graph and is invariant under the graph automorphism. To establish a correlation model between the structures of chemical compounds and the coressponding chemical and physical properties it is required to numerically code the structures of chemical compounds. hence in the QSAR/QSPR studied the task is to transfer the graph into numerical format. for this purpose there are many techniques in which the popular one is topological indices. In more precise way, a topological index Top(G) of a graph, is a number such that, if H is isomorphic to G, then Top(H)=Top(G). The concept of topological indices came from Wiener [30] while he was working on boiling point of paraffin, named this index as path number. Later on, the path number was renamed as Wiener index [7]. There are three major classes of topological indices which are distance based topological indices, degree based topological indices and counting related. Among these classes degree based topological indices are of great importance and play a vital role in chemical graph theory and particularly in theoretical chemistry.
In this article, G is considered to be a graph with vertex set and edge set V(G) and E(G) respectively. The degree of a vertex u ∈ V(G) in a graph G is the number of edges which are incident with vertex u. It is denoted by du. The notations used in this article are mainly taken from the books [10], [15].
Let G be a connected graph. Then the Wiener index [30] of G is defined as
(1)W(G)=12∑(u,v)d(u,v)where (u, v) is any ordered pair of vertices in G and d(u, v) is the distance between the vertices u and v.
Milan Randić [28] introduced the oldest degree based topological index Randić index, denoted by R−12(G) and defined as
(2)R−12(G)=∑uv∈E(G)1dudvRandić index was then generalized by Bollobás and Erdös [5] for any real number α. The general Randić index, Rα(G), is defined as
(3)Rα(G)=∑uv∈E(G)(dudv)αforα∈RGutman and Trinajstić [16] introduced the first and second Zagreb indices, denoted by M1(G) and M2(G), respectively and defined as
(4)M1(G)=∑uv∈E(G)(du+dv)(5)M2(G)=∑uv∈E(G)(dG(u)dG(v)).The general Randić index for α=1 is the second Zagreb index for any graph. Estrada et al. [11] introduced a well known topological index, called the atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index. It is defined as
(6)ABC(G)=∑uv∈E(G)du+dv−2dudvThe degree based topological index geometric-arithmetic (GA) index was introduced by Vukičević et al. in [29] and defined as
(7)GA(G)=∑uv∈E(G)2dudvdu+dvSome versions of the atom bond connectivity (ABC) index and geometric arithemetic GA index was defined recently. Ghorbani et al. [13] introduced the fourth version of ABC index and defined as
(8)ABC4(G)=∑uv∈E(G)Su+Sv−2SuSv,where Su=∑v∈NG(u)dv where NG(u)={v∈V(G)∣uv∈E(G)}.
The fifth version of GA index is proposed by Graovac et al. [14] and defined as
(9)GA5(G)=∑uv∈E(G)2SuSvSu+SvThe eccentric version of atom-bond connectivity idex, ABC5 and geometric-arithmetic index, GA4 were introduced by Vukičević et al. [29] and Ghorbani et al. [9] repectively, by using the eccentricity of each vertex of a connected graph. They are defined as
ABC5(G)=∑uv∈E(G)eu+ev−2euevWhere eu=maxv∈V(G)d(u,v).
GA4(G)=∑uv∈E(G)2eueveu+evImran et al. studied various degree based topological indices for various networks like silicates, hexagonal, honeycomb and oxide in [20]. Nowadays there is an extensive research activity on ABC and GA indices and their variants. For further study of topological indices of various graphs and chemical structures, see [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [12], [17], [18], [19], [21], [22], [24], [25], [26], [27].
