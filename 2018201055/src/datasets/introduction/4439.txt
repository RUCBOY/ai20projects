The world is connected through networks. The most prominent example is probably the Internet which consists of a huge number of computers and users spread around the world. According to Wikipedia, the definition of the Internet is given as “a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the standard Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link several billion devices worldwide”. With the advent of networks, traditional point-to-point control systems are being reshaped and redefined, which gives birth to networked control systems (NCSs) wherein feedback control loops are closed via communication networks [24], [29], [85]. The defining feature of an NCS is that system components, such as sensors, controllers and actuators, are connected via some network medium, such as control area network (CAN), BACnet, Fieldbus, Ethernet and Internet. Therefore, information, such as reference inputs, system outputs or control inputs, is exchanged among system components via networks [24]. Compared with traditional point-to-point control systems, NCSs offer several advantages, such as low installation and maintenance costs, high reliability, increased system flexibility, easy re-configurability and decreased volume of wiring.
Generally, there are three configurations of NCSs: centralized configuration, decentralized configuration, and distributed configuration.
Centralized configuration. As shown in Fig. 1(a), sensed measurement (reference input, system state or system output) on each sensor node should be sent to a centralized controller embedding a central processing unit for data fusion. The centralized controller takes advantage of full knowledge of the system. Suitable data fusion methods are necessary to obtain fused data which are utilized for computing control executions. These control executions are then transmitted to actuators for actuating the system. Even though multiple sensors and actuators may be present, this configuration, in certain situations, can be deemed as an NCS with a single feedback loop where all measurement is required to be measured by a dedicated sensor node and then to be sent together in a single packet to a remote controller node. A control execution is finally fed back to a dedicated actuator node. Since information of the measurement is available at the controller side, the main advantage of this centralized configuration is that the control performance may be generally optimal. Analysis and synthesis of NCSs by using this configuration have been well studied and considerable results have been available in the literature, see for example, references in Table 1. The centralized configuration, however, has several drawbacks: (i) the controller is susceptible to total failure of the central processing unit; (ii) there is a high cost for the central processing unit collecting data from individual sensor node; (iii) there is an increased computational burden in the central processing unit; and (iv) due to scalability issue, it has a limited application scope in modern control systems where a large number of distributed sensing and processing nodes are deployed such as airplanes and manufacturing plants.Download : Download high-res image (660KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Decentralized configuration. Within this configuration, as shown in Fig. 1(b), each controller node may depend on only local information that the controller possesses to make its local decision. Consequently, even though the entire system may have an overall team objective, distributed controller nodes do not share information with neighboring nodes. Analysis and synthesis of such NCSs may reduce to analyzing and synthesizing NCSs with multiple feedback loops, see for example, references presented in Table 1. More specifically, each controller locally performs its local computation of a control execution by using measurement through local communication link and then each control execution is sent back to an actuator node for actuating the system. Compared with the centralized configuration, this decentralized configuration alleviates computation burden and design complexity because local control executions are computed within local controllers. A major concern of the decentralized configuration lies in that sub-optimal control performance may be achieved due to individual controller node not having as much information regarding the state or output of the system as in the centralized configuration. In this sense, a decentralized configuration may be more scalable if local control decisions are close to an optimal global control decision. However, the absence of communication and cooperation between decentralized controllers may lead to deteriorated system performance and limit the application scope of the decentralized configuration in wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) where a large number of nodes coordinate their activities through communication networks.
Distributed configuration. An NCS within this configuration is known as a distributed networked control system (DNCS), which possesses two notable characteristics: (i) information of each subsystem is exchanged among system components (e.g., sensors, controllers and actuators) using a shared communication network; and (ii) the plant usually consists of a large number of simple interacting units (e.g., subsystems and agents) that can be physically distributed and interconnected to others to coordinate their tasks for achieving a desired overall objective. These two characteristics mainly lead to the so-called cooperative control. Within such configuration, as shown in Fig. 1(c), each controller may be allowed to share its local information with its all underlying neighboring controllers for gaining additional information about the plant dynamics. Thus, distributed controllers are capable to coordinate their behavior by transmitting/receiving information to/from other controllers within a certain neighboring area. The advantages imposed by this configuration include modularity, scalability and robustness.
With the rapid advancement and use of Internet, embedded systems, wireless communication technologies and novel control strategies, DNCSs have been increasingly more paramount and at the core of critical infrastructures, service systems and industrial control systems, such as distributed transportation networks, distributed electrical power systems and smart grids, remote surgery, cellular phone networks, industrial and manufacturing systems, biological networks and flocking. Even though some of the advantages and applications of DNCSs are clearly recognizable from systems and applications aforementioned, there is still no comprehensive theory in completely understanding the analysis and synthesis of such systems. It becomes clear that any progress made along this research line would then necessarily expand knowledge about broad theory and wide applications of DNCSs.
In this paper, we provide a brief overview of DNCSs regarding recent advances, challenges, methodologies and future work. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a number of challenging issues in DNCSs are briefly surveyed and outlined from three aspects: communication, computation and control. In Section 3, control methodologies to deal with some challenges of DNCSs in the existing literature are classified and reviewed. In Section 4, conclusions are made and potential research topics are discussed.
