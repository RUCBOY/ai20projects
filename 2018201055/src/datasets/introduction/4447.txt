Recently, image set based object representation and recognition is an important and active research problem in computer vision and pattern recognition area [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. The aim of image set based object recognition is to achieve object recognition task using multiple images or video frames that belong to one object [7], [8], [9]. Comparing with traditional single image based object recognition, image set involves more appearance information of the object and thus contains more visual information for conducting object recognition tasks.
The main issues for image set based object recognition are two aspects: (1) How to represent an image set and thus can capture the variations of multiple images of object appearances effectively. (2) How to develop an effective learning method for image set and thus conduct object recognition tasks effectively. For image set representation, many methods have been proposed [10], [1], [2], [8], [9], [4], [11]. Among them, one kind of popular methods is to use parametric statistical models [8], [1], [12]. The main idea of these methods is to first use some statistical distributions to represent an image set, and then use some divergence measurement to compute the similarity measurement between image sets. Non-parametric models have also been explored for image set representation [9]. In additional to statistical methods, many works also aim to represent an image set using a single or multiple linear subspaces [13], [7]. Also, nonlinear manifold models have been explored for image set representation [14], [15], which generally first represents image sets with nonlinear manifolds and then develops a manifold distance metric to compute the distance measurement for image sets.
Overall, previous methods generally conduct each image of an image set as a feature vector, i.e., they usually treat the image set as a feature vector set. Thus, they usually ignore the 2D spatial relationship/structure between image pixels (features). Indeed, the spatial structure information has been usually used and shown importantly in traditional single image based object recognition task. One popular way to extract structure information is to use a graph representation model [16], [17], [18]. However, to the best of our knowledge, this 2D spatial structure information has been less studied or emphasized for image set representation and recognition task. This motivates us to explore a graph model for image set representation. The main contributions of this paper are twofold: (1) a new image set representation model, called Attributed Covariate-Relation Graph (ACRG), has been proposed for image set representation. Our previous work on graph based image set modeling has been proposed in the work [19]. Comparing with previous work, the proposed ACRG method involves both image features and their spatial distribution simultaneously. (2) Inspired by recent work on sparse representation classification (SRC) [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] method, we propose a new graph data based sparse representation and classification method to achieve ACRG classification and conduct image set classification effectively. In this paper, we call it as Graph Sparse Representation Classification (GSRC). Our GSRC can be regarded as an extension of SRC on attributed relation graph data. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the better performance of the proposed ACRG representation and GSRC classification method.
