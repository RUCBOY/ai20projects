Depression is one of the most common mental disorders and it is estimated that 350 million people of all ages suffer from depression globally (Marcus et al., 2016). World Health Organization predicts that depression will be the leading cause of disease burden worldwide by the year 2030 (World Health Organization, 2011). Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2009–2012 has indicated that about 7.6% of people aged 12 and over had moderate or severe depression (Pratt and Brody, 2014). Studies have found that females are more likely to experience depressive symptoms than male (de Wit et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2016). Several researches have been conducted to seek the association between depression and individual characteristics such as: physical activity, socio-economic status and existing disease conditions, and reported that these factors are associated with depression (Freeman et al., 2016, Ma and Xiao, 2010, Vallance et al., 2011, Zhao et al., 2011). Research in sedentary behavior and health risk suggests that engaging in sedentary behavior is associated with depression and several chronic diseases such as: type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (de Wit et al., 2011, Megan et al., 2014, Teychenne et al., 2010).
Sedentary behavior can be defined as behavior characterized by a seated or reclining posture and low energy expenditure (≤ 1.5 Metabolic Equivalent Task) (Teychenne et al., 2010). TV watching and computer use are common sedentary activities in United States and elsewhere. People who spend > 4 h of screen time such as: TV watching and computer use, are at higher risk of developing depression (de Wit et al., 2011, Hamer et al., 2013). While, it is also reported that people with depressive symptoms spend significantly more hours in a day, watching TV and using computer (de Wit et al., 2011).
Most of the studies have focused towards the relation of physical activity with mental health. The role of physical activity in mental health is well established in several studies and it is proven that physically active individuals are less likely to suffer from depressive symptoms (Hamer et al., 2010). However, there are a limited number of studies done to assess screen time (TV watching and computer use) and depression, controlling major demographic and socio-economic factors. This study aims to assess the relationship between screen time and depression risk among U.S. adults and select the best model to predict depression.
