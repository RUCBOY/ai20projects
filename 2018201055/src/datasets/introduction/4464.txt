Acquiring English as a second or foreign language for the purposes of pursuing a career in the Sciences is a daunting task. Much of this has to do with the learning burden associated with comprehending lexically demanding discipline-specific texts, which have high densities of technical vocabulary—that is, mid- to low-frequency words particular to a specific subject. Given the resultant high lexical threshold necessary for comprehension, a mastery of a sizeable vocabulary beyond high-frequency and academic words is necessary. Intentional learning, essential for acquiring a large vocabulary, is key for such an undertaking; however, because there are limits to how much vocabulary can be taught explicitly in the classroom, incidental learning through extensive reading outside the classroom is an invaluable supplementary aid to vocabulary learning (Nagy and Herman, 1987, Schmitt, 2008).
Literary texts in particular are ideal resources, as they offer a wealth of potentially comprehensible input and can be accessed relatively easily. Nevertheless, in many second- and foreign-language classrooms, where “learning is fundamentally an exercise with utilitarian (i.e., career) goals” (Shanahan, 1997: 165), literary texts are considered irrelevant, carrying instead a ‘humanist agenda’ that fails to prepare second-language (L2) learners for the academic and professional careers ahead of them (Horowitz, 1990). In short, some of the primary doubts surrounding the efficacy of learning language through literature seem to be rooted in notions of insufficient learner payoff. Proponents maintain, however, that learner payoff includes greater learner autonomy; enhanced critical thinking and interpretive skills; more communicative confidence; greater language, text, and cultural awareness; more learner motivation and interest; and better retention, among other benefits. Moreover, literary materials have been shown to be an important resource in ESL acquisition, retention, and proficiency, offering learners improvement in productive and receptive language skills, as well as the language areas of grammar and vocabulary.1
Nevertheless, English for Specific Purposes (ESP) in particular has generally rejected literature, due in part to the genre's insufficient coverage of discipline-specific vocabulary. The literary subgenre of science fiction-fantasy (SFF), however, likely comprises higher levels of technical vocabulary relevant to the Sciences than does general fiction, and therefore could serve as a resource for developing language skills in science-related ESP programs (Boiero de Angelo et al., 2008, Díaz-Santos, 2000, Hirvela, 1990, Kelly and Krishnan, 1995, Zoreda, 1996, Zoreda, 2002). To date, though, no research has been undertaken to determine quantitatively how well SFF, or any literary subgenre, covers scientific technical vocabulary.
To address the gap in research, this study aims to investigate the extent to which SFF can contribute to L2 scientific literacy by examining the frequency and lexical coverage of science-specific technical vocabulary in SFF texts, as compared to that found in general fiction texts and science texts. In doing so, this research could better inform practitioners and researchers regarding the potential that specific literary genres have as resources for incidental learning of L2 discipline-specific vocabulary.
1.1. Incidental L2 vocabulary acquisition through extensive readingIncidental vocabulary acquisition occurs when new or partially known words are acquired through untargeted exposure to input (Huckin & Coady, 1999). Research into adult L2 incidental vocabulary acquisition suggests that this is particularly so when the input is written as opposed to spoken (Brown et al., 2008, Vidal, 2011), and when the input is wide ranging and sizeable (Huckin and Coady, 1999, Krashen, 1985). Extensive reading, or reading widely for pleasure and meaning with some component of accountability (Krashen, 2003), meets both of these conditions, making it ideal for incidental vocabulary learning. Indeed, over the past several decades, numerous researchers have recognized the positive effects it can have on vocabulary acquisition, retention, and usage in both the L1 (Nagy and Herman, 1987, Nagy et al., 1985) and the L2 (Brown et al., 2008, Day et al., 1991, Horst et al., 1998, Huckin and Coady, 1999, Pellicer-Sánchez and Schmitt, 2010, Pigada and Schmitt, 2006, Pitts et al., 1989, Saragi et al., 1978, Waring and Nation, 2004).1.1.1. What kind of input is required for incidental learning to occur?One key to incidental vocabulary acquisition through extensive reading is that L2 learners be exposed to texts that are appropriate to the learners (Waring & Nation, 2004). According to Krashen (1985), this includes texts that are slightly more difficult than the learner's comprehension level. This concept, which underlies his Input Hypothesis (IH), is represented as ‘i+1,’ where ‘i’ is the learner's current level of competence, and ‘+1’ is the next level of language acquisition. Krashen argues that as long as there is sufficient comprehensible input, i+1 exists for all L2 learners in much the same way i+1 exists for young children learning their native language through caretaker input. That is, even though the input is not finely tuned to a learner's competence level, instead comprising utterances both more and less advanced, L2 learners can select aspects of the input that are relevant to their particular level, in much the same way children do (Krashen, 2013). Several studies carried out in ESL contexts have investigated the hypothesis using fiction texts as the input, with results indicating development of new and partially learned vocabulary (Cho and Krashen, 1994, Constantino, 1995, Kim, 2006, Lao and Krashen, 2000, Renandya et al., 1999).For incidental learning to occur when the input is written, it is thought that an L2 learner must know approximately 98% of the running words in a given text, the equivalent of roughly one unknown word in fifty (Hirsh and Nation, 1992, Hu and Nation, 2000, Nation, 2006, Schmitt et al., 2011), and that otherwise, learners are less likely to be able to guess new vocabulary from context (Waring & Takaki, 2003). While this equates to a required vocabulary size of between 8,000 and 9,000 word families for general fiction texts (Nation, 2006), the threshold increases significantly in academic texts (Waring & Nation, 2004). Hazenberg and Hulstijn (1996), for example, established in their study of Dutch college students reading first-year university materials that to understand just 95% of an academic text, knowledge of approximately 11,000 word families (including proper nouns) is likely necessary. This suggests that reaching the 98% lexical coverage threshold required for incidental learning to occur in post-secondary academic texts likely requires knowledge of well over 11,000 word families. Indeed, Coxhead, Stevens, and Tinkle (2010) found that reaching 98% coverage in high-school science textbooks alone could require learners to know between 11,000 and 20,000 words (plus proper nouns).The higher lexical threshold necessary for understanding specialized texts is partly due to the larger proportion of technical vocabulary, which Nation (2016) defines as words or phrases that are closely related to a particular subject, field, or discipline in form, meaning, or both. Chung and Nation (2003), for instance, found that technical words made up 37.6% of the different words (types) and 31.2% of the running words (tokens) in an anatomy text, and 16.3% of types and 20.6% of tokens in an applied linguistics text. Cobb and Horst's discipline-specific lexical–frequency profile also found notably high levels of specialized terminology (i.e., beyond the General Service List (GSL) and Academic Word List (AWL)) in texts representing the fields of medicine (18.4%) and zoology (11.4%) (2004). Such high proportions of technical vocabulary mean that only the most advanced L2 learners will be able to reach the crucial 98% lexical threshold in authentic academic texts, making incidental learning through extensive reading of authentic scientific texts highly unlikely for the vast majority of L2 learners (i.e., those who have not had prior training in scientific disciplines). A resource that exposes learners to lower proportions of technical vocabulary than authentic science texts but higher proportions than general fiction (i.e., more comprehensible input) could help bridge the gap between general literacy and scientific literacy.21.1.2. How many exposures to a word are necessary for incidental learning to occur?Another key to improving vocabulary incidentally through extensive reading is ensuring sufficiently frequent exposure to unknown words. Since vocabulary acquisition is understood to be incremental in nature, learners must encounter words multiple times for meaningful lexical gains to occur (Nagy and Herman, 1987, Nation, 2013, Pellicer-Sánchez and Schmitt, 2010, Saragi et al., 1978, Schmitt, 1998). While it is likely that there is no particular number of repetitions that guarantees a word will be learned, Nation's (1990) survey of vocabulary studies suggests that a range of 3–16 repetitions of a word might be necessary. More recent research seems to agree with the middle to latter end of this range, with Waring and Nation's (2004) review of the research literature concluding that most meaningful lexical gains can be made after between 6 and 10 exposures to a word.However, several important studies that consider partial knowledge of words (i.e., a vocabulary dimensions framework) have also shown that more lexical learning might be occurring during extensive reading than studies measuring the form-meaning link suggest, and that these more nuanced aspects of word knowledge have varying thresholds for the number of repetitions required for adequate learning to take place. Table 1 summarizes findings from the most commonly cited of these studies. Specifically, the table shows the expected percent gain of some aspect of the target vocabulary that various researchers found given a certain number of exposures during extensive reading.Table 1.

Italicized numerals are frequency bands used in the respective studies. Values are % gains of the target vocabulary after extensive reading. Where multiple post-tests were applied in the study, only % gains from the first post-test are included.aFindings for Pigada and Schmitt (2006) are shown as % gain of nouns & verbs.bFindings for Brown et al. (2008) represent overall scores rather than % gain.Waring and Takaki (2003), for example, found that learners would likely be able to recognize the form of 10% of all target words met one time, but given four to five exposures to the same word, they would be able to recognize the form of 46%. Although the research often focuses primarily on the less context-dependent aspects of form, meaning, and grammatical behavior, and there are some contradictory findings (e.g., Pellicer-Sánchez and Schmitt's findings that meaning recognition requires fewer exposures than form recognition challenge those in Waring and Takaki's study), when taken together, they indicate a general consensus that 10 or more exposures to a word are likely necessary for the majority of meaningful lexical acquisition, but that a multitude of important gains are also attainable given fewer than 10 exposures.
1.2. Specific literature for specific purposesThus, for incidental learning to be most successful, L2 learners must have a substantial vocabulary size—enough to cover 98% of a text—but must also somehow be sufficiently exposed to new target vocabulary—ideally 10 or more repetitions per word. To address this “lexical paradox” (Cobb, 2007), several researchers and practitioners have suggested that genre-specific literary texts can be exploited to develop discipline-specific vocabulary if the texts selected are within the realm of that discipline. Petit (1999) and Isani (2009), for instance, both propose utilizing ‘professionally-based fiction’ (PBF)—popular fiction that presents professionals in pseudo-realistic occupational situations—to supplement L2 learning in such professional domains as law, forensics, medicine, science, technology, history, journalism, and art. Similarly, advocates of ‘literature for specific purposes’ (e.g., Corona and Garcia, 1996, Hirvela, 1990, Spack, 1985) argue that because general and academic discourses often intersect in popular fiction texts, which tend to be more comprehensible than discipline-specific technical texts, the use of such materials potentially creates easier, more productive pathways to academic and professional literacy, thus better equipping L2 learners for the careers ahead of them.The SFF subgenre is perhaps especially apposite to scientific disciplines in this regard, and indeed several researchers have advocated its use in ESP to help L2 learners gain literacy in the Sciences (e.g., Boiero de Angelo et al., 2008, Díaz-Santos, 2000, Hirvela, 1990, Kelly and Krishnan, 1995, Zoreda, 1996, Zoreda, 2002). Several qualitative studies support these assertions. Hirvela (1990), who applied a ‘language through literature’ framework to teach college engineering students in Hong Kong, observed participants' language use before and after they read the science-fiction novel Stitch in Time, concluding that overall productive (spoken and written) scientific language proficiency improved. Díaz-Santos (2000) details the use of contemporary high-tech fiction in English for Science and Technology (EST) courses, which he established had a positive impact on his students' linguistic performance and motivation to learn English. More recently, Boiero de Angelo et al. (2008), who incorporated science-fiction stories into three ESP courses for biology, microbiology, geology, math, and computer science students, found that 90% of the 91 participants indicated that the texts facilitated vocabulary development, and 78% indicated improvement in grammatical comprehension.Despite the potential for positive learning outcomes from using SFF in ESP classrooms, no existing research examines the texts themselves for their coverage of technical vocabulary. Several studies have briefly considered how well technical vocabulary is covered in general fiction texts (Coxhead, 2000, Coxhead and Hirsh, 2007, Xue and Nation, 1984), but they have only done so to validate specialized word lists. There has otherwise been no research examining the frequency of technical vocabulary in specific subgenres of literary fiction.
1.3. Research questionsThe aim of this research is to investigate quantitatively whether SFF is a relevant resource for incidental learning of science-specific vocabulary. Specifically, the research seeks to provide a more contextualized understanding of where SFF fits as a resource for L2 vocabulary learning among the broader, seemingly dichotomous categories of “academic” and “nonacademic” writing, as well as to establish whether science-specific vocabulary occurs in SFF texts sufficiently to be learned incidentally through extensive reading. To do so, the study addresses the following questions:1.What is the coverage of a list of science-specific word family members in a corpus of science fiction-fantasy texts, compared to that in a corpus of fiction texts and a corpus of science texts?2.How many science word families could feasibly be met given various amounts of extensive reading of SFF, and which amount will likely provide the most 10+ exposures to science word families with the least amount of reading (i.e., be the most ‘economical’)?3.Based on previous vocabulary research, what lexical gains might be expected at the most ‘economical’ reading level?
