The idea of taking a major research approach such as positivism or interpretivism and then asking what implications does this approach have for crafting theory is a good one (Lee et al., 2014, Lee and Hovorka, 2015) and can yield insightful and useful papers. The current paper attempts this task for systems theory but is too narrow and rather old-fashioned for it to successfully do justice to such a rich and vibrant field
The first problem is that the field of systems is so broad as to defy any sort of succinct definition or description as this paper attempts. We immediately face this in the title which refers to “systems science”. This already points to a particular, and one-sided, view of systems as opposed to “systems thinking”, “the systems approach” or “systems theory”. This is confirmed in Section 2 where it is stated that “Systems science is also known as ‘General Systems Theory’ (GST)” (page ?) so, in reality, the paper is actually only about one fairly small and arguably outdated facet of the very rich world of systems thinking.
The second problem is that even this area is dealt with in a rather cursory manner. In terms of any detail, it covers only a single theorist – Niklas Luhmann – who is rather marginal, highly abstract and complex, and is not really a representative of GST as it was originally defined by the likes of von Bertalanffy (1971), Boulding (1956) and Rapoport (1986).
