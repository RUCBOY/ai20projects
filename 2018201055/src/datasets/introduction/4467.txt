Since the 1920s, and through its exponential growth from the 1950s, the concept of information has occupied a significant amount of space in intellectual and scientific discourses in biology (Dretske, 1981, Griffiths, 2001, Godfrey-Smith, 2007). The concept entered the field of biology most conspicuously during the 1960s with the notion of genetic information and genetic code (Sarkar, 1996). Quite early on, other biological fields like physiology and developmental biology (through the concept of signalling pathways (Tkaƒçik et al., 2008), ecology (Dall et al., 2005, Rivoire and Leibler, 2011) or evolutionary biology (Griffiths, 2001, Godfrey-Smith, 2007) recognized the heuristic power of the information concept. In each case, they adapted the concept to their own disciplinary needs and contexts, with very different senses: either as a measure of contingency between the states of a system (Godfrey-Smith, 2007), as a mean for organisms to reduce uncertainty associated to foraging, mating and other processes (van Baalen, 2013), or as a biological instruction (Monod, 1972, Barbieri, 2008). In evolutionary biology for instance, dynamics of allelic frequency changes have been interpreted as patterns bearing an information about the historical environments into which gene populations were embedded (Maynard-Smith, 2000, Angelier, 2008.). A result of these multiple introductions and disciplinary re-definitions was the present-day semantic complexity associated with the notion of information in biology (Godfrey-Smith, 2007, Barbieri, 2008, Kupiec et al., 2016).
If information concept remains useful in life sciences, how to define it and how can we understand its high polysemy? In this paper, we claim that the concept of language presents itself as a useful tool with which to bridge the gap between the two irreducible but linked poles of the information continuum, the syntactic and the semantic poles. Besides, to use the concept of language as a basis for interpretation of biological phenomena is not far from other views originally proposed by Waddington (1972) or by Thom (1968). First, we aim at showing that neither pole by itself can adequately describe, model, or predict natural phenomena, and that the historical and present-day uses of the information concept can be classified in terms of degrees of oscillation between these two poles. Second, we propose to consider the conceptual advantage and mathematical modelling fecundity of formal language theory in biological sciences (Palacios et al., 1998, Witzany, 2016).
