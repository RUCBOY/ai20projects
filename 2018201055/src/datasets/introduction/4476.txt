A brain–computer interface (BCI) provides a new connection channel between a human brain and a computer [1], [2]. BCI can translate the task-related neural responses into the useful computer commands. Accordingly, those severely disabled people can achieve real-time communication with the external environment by the BCI systems [3], [4], [5], [6]. Electroencephalogram (EEG) technique has been most widely adopted to measure the neural responses, typically including P300, steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) and sensorimotor rhythm, etc. for BCI applications [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. In recent years, SSVEP-based BCI has been increasingly studied due to its relatively higher information transfer rate [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20].
An SSVEP-based BCI usually presents several visual stimuli flickering at different frequencies to the user (also called subject). As a periodic neural response, SSVEP is evoked at the same frequency as that of the stimulus and also includes higher harmonics, over occipital scalp region, when the subject focuses attention on one of the stimuli [21]. The SSVEP-based BCI can be exploited to recognize the SSVEP frequency components from EEG, and hence to detect commands desired by the subject. However, a challenge issue for the SSVEP-based BCI is how to accurately recognize the SSVEP, since it is likely to be contaminated by the background noises in the brain [22], [23], [24].
Due to the effects of volume conduction in brain, accurate recognition of SSVEP can hardly be achieved with single-channel detection by the traditional power spectral density analysis (PSDA). In the past few years, minimum energy combination (MEC) [22] and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) [23] have been proposed to improve SSVEP recognition performance through exploiting multichannel information. The MEC method aims at finding spatial filters to minimize the nuisance signals and noises as much as possible from the multichannel EEG. The CCA method discovers the dominant frequency component through maximizing the correlation between the multichannel EEG and the predefined reference signals. In recent years, several other more advanced algorithms have been proposed for SSVEP-based BCI. A multivariate synchronization index (MSI)-based method [25] was proposed to calculate the synchronization index between EEG and the reference signals for SSVEP recognition with improved performance. A multiway CCA (MCCA) [26] was introduced to optimize the reference signals in the CCA-based method through collaboratively optimization between the channel-way and trial-way arrays of EEG tensor. However, the SSVEP responses from the same subject may vary from trial to trial. For instance, a “good” trial presents distinctive SSVEP characteristics at the stimulus frequency and its higher harmonics while a “bad” one provides poor results (see Fig. 1). As a result, MCCA without any regularization may not result in the optimal recognition accuracy. To address this problem, a L1-regularized version of MCCA (L1-MCCA) [27] has been proposed to further enhance the SSVEP recognition performance by selecting significant trials. The L1-MCCA method was demonstrated to outperform both the CCA and MCCA methods. Some other algorithms recently proposed for SSVEP recognition can be found in the literatures [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36].Download : Download high-res image (359KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

The selection of regularization parameter usually plays a considerably important role in the L1-MCCA method. Cross-validation (CV) has been usually adopted to determine the most appropriate parameter. However, CV requires additional data for the parameter validation and relatively high computational cost. These limitations will substantially reduce the practicability of BCI system. Bayesian inference treats the regularization in a probabilistic framework, and provides an effective approach to automatically and quickly estimate the model parameters [37], [38], [39], [40]. In recent years, some Bayesian based methods have been introduced to automatic spatial filtering of EEG [41], [42], [43]. In this study, we propose a Bayesian version of L1-MCCA (called SBMCCA) for SSVEP recognition by alternately exploiting sparse Bayesian learning [44]. Compared with L1-MCCA, SBMCCA does not requires CV with additional data to validate the selection of regularization parameter. The model parameters can be automatically estimated under the Bayesian evidence framework. As a result, higher efficiency could be achieved for the SSVEP-based BCI. Experimental study confirms that the proposed SBMCCA achieved comparable recognition accuracy but much lower computational cost in contrast to the L1-MCCA method.
