Advancement in medical treatment and expanded life expectancy led to increased survival rates and life span for many pathological and aging-related gait impairments, such as various types of muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, stroke, and aging-caused muscle weakness, etc [1], [2], [3]. The increasing number of such gait-impaired patients casts a rising demand on fast, accurate diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression, which can be used in take-home healthcare [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. The diagnosis and monitoring of gait-impaired diseases require kinematics and kinetics information of gait. For example, in order to monitor the progression of muscular dystrophy, both kinematics and kinetics are needed to reveal the pathological changing of gait pattern and motions, as well as the adaptation of joint moment, from which muscle weakening and even motoneuron lesion can be excavated [9].
An ideal technique that provides such information can make real-time or even ahead-of-time prediction of kinematics and kinetics with enough accuracy, while the data acquisition is made to be convenient for patients by utilizing data from wearable sensors [10]. However, current techniques for acquiring kinematics and kinetics information cannot fulfill the rapidity and accuracy requirement of such smart healthcare. For kinematics acquisition, pattern recognition-based [11], [12], [13] and rule-based methods [14] just provide discrete phase information. Adaptive oscillator-based [15], [16], [17] and Kalman filter-based methods [18], although predict continuous kinematics, might suffer from convergent time and the strong dependence on periodic characteristics of gait. For kinetics acquisition, foot pressure insole provides detailed information of ground reactive force and thus can be used to infer the joint moment [19]. However, the demand for customizing shape and size of pressure insoles might limit their usage on gait analysis [20]. Musculoskeletal models, utilizing EMG signals and kinematics, can provide an insightful knowledge of muscle power, tendon stretch and joint moment. However, time-costing parameter identification based on laboratory experiments decreases its potential for take-home usage [21]. In addition, the optical motion capture system combined with a ground reactive force plate provides the golden standard of both kinematics and kinetics, which requires controlled laboratory settings, trained staff, and costly facilities [22]. Such fatal flaws limit their use in real-time application scenarios.
To address these limitations, there is a recent push to use easy-to-wear sensors to predict kinematics and kinetics information. The advanced development of deep learning enables such application under various scenarios [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Thus, in this paper, deep learning techniques were employed to address these limitations and give an initial attempt to predict kinematics and kinetics with wearable sensors. Particularly, an LSTM regressor is trained and used to infer lower-limb kinematics using EMG and IMU signals based on exploiting the influence of electromechanical delay (EMD) on prediction time. Based on the predicted angles, a computationally efficient inverse dynamic model of human—composed of 7 segments is built by exploring ground–feet wrench and the kinetic principles of human locomotion. And the prediction time of kinematics is of vital importance in compensating for the computation time of the whole algorithm. Thus, real-time acquisition of basic gait information can be achieved to enable further diagnosis or monitoring for smart healthcare-oriented applications. The main contribution of this paper is summarized as follow:

•To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study oriented to healthcare applications, which realizes a continuous ahead-of-time prediction of lower-limb kinematics based on the electromechanical delay (EMD).•Based on the exploration of the ground–feet wrench and the kinetic principles of human locomotion, a computationally efficient algorithm is proposed for calculating lower-limb kinetics without employing pressure insoles.

The experimental validation is presented in Section 4. The discussion and conclusion are shown in Sections 5 Discussion, 6 Conclusion.
