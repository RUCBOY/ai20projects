Many research has been published in the subject of indoor air quality (IAQ) in schools, particularly in primary, elementary, and middle schools for various reasons such as higher susceptibility of children to environmental pollutants [1], [2], higher inhalation rates per body mass [3], and longer time spent in schools [4]. A mega study of over 300 peer-reviewed articles and 87 health education reports from 1982 to 1999 by Daisey [5] reported that the prevalence of respiratory diseases such as asthma and allergies are associated with school health environment, and that, ventilation is inadequate in many classrooms. Vincent [6] stated that air quality inside schools is often worse than outdoor pollution, leading to various health complaints and loss of productivity. Poor IAQ in school buildings has adverse effects on academic performance of students [7], [8], [9]. Exposure to indoor air pollutants affects peoples' perceptions even at low concentrations normally found in schools [10].
Studies identified different pollutant parameters that contribute to IAQ problems in samples of schools in various countries; for instance, high PM10 and CO2 levels in Porto, Portugal [11], Hong Kong [12] and Munich, Germany [13]; high mean concentrations of both PM10 and PM2.5 in Lahore, Pakistan [14]; higher mean indoor CO2 concentration than the ASHRAE standards-62 [15] of 1000 ppm in Athens, Greece [16], [17], and Serbia [18], or the CO2 value established by Portuguese legislation [19]; high CH2O concentration emitted by building materials or furnishings in South Korea [20] and France [21]; and high average SO2 concentrations in French schools [22].
Although several studies have reported that CO2 concentration in schools often do not meet building standards due to inadequate ventilation [23], [24], [25], [26], other researchers reported that complaints on poor IAQ in schools were not only related to low ventilation or increased CO2 levels, but also to other indoor contaminants [4]. Comparison of indoor and outdoor concentration of CO at a public school in Central Athens showed that the mean daily I/O concentration ratios ranged between 0.49 and 0.89; indoor measurements were conducted using a Dasibi 3008 non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO analyzer [27]. Wargocki et al. [28] suggested that IAQ could be improved by increasing the fresh air intake and minimizing the emissions by curtailing the sources of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a simulated office environment. Indoor pollutant concentrations in schools reflect outdoor concentrations for PM10 [29] and for PM (0.3–20 μm) and NOx regardless of building air-tightness [30].
The measured indoor concentrations of some pollutants were reported to be higher than the outdoor concentrations in buildings which are similar to school settings. For instance, Lai et al. [31] reported higher PM2.5 analyzed for 37 metals, total volatile organic compounds (TVOC) including 30 organic compounds, NO2 and CO in Oxford City, UK. Zuraimi et al. [32] compared the IAQ in European and Singaporean office buildings. They reported high concentration of 2-methylpentane, n-hexane and isoprene in European buildings as compared to Singaporean buildings, while n-tetradecane, 2-ethyl-hexanol, benzene, toluene, m/p-xylene, benzaldehyde and nephthelene are high in Singaporean buildings due to low fresh air intake.
Despite the large number of published research investigating IAQ in schools, only one study regarding IAQ in Kuwaiti schools has been undertaken [33]. Few other studies investigated practices leading to indoor air pollution and the prevalence of symptoms in the homes of Kuwaiti students [34], [35]. Other researchers investigated ambient air quality in the vicinity of Kuwaiti schools [36]; while others extensively studied IAQ in Kuwaiti homes [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. This article is based on the detailed research project that has been conducted in the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research (KISR) and completed in 2012 [42]. This article presents a procedure to carry out a comprehensive IAQ investigation in schools using passive samplers, portable CO2 monitors, sequential particulate sampling, and dust sampling from air conditioning filters.
