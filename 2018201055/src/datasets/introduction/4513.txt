Recent trends in Internet connected devices include cloud-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) [1]. Cloud-enabled IoT devices are collectively referred to as ``Cloud of Things'' (CoT) [2]. CoT deployment allows scalable processing and storage of big data streams [3], beyond the capabilities of IoT end nodes (e.g., mobile devices, security cameras, smart TVs, and other smart household appliances). It has been predicted that CoT will account for 90% of all IoT data by 2019 [4]. Hence, it is unsurprising that CoT has become a target for cyber criminals [5], [6] such as information theft, industrial espionage, distributed denial of service (DDoS) and resources attacks, side channel attacks, malicious software distribution, spamming, and insider threats. Such concerns are compounded by the revelations of National Security Agency (NSA)â€™s surveillance programs (e.g., PRISM and MUSCULAR) where government agencies were collecting user data from cloud service providers (CSPs) without prior consent of the data owner [7]. Therefore, private cloud services such as BitTorrent Sync peer-to-peer (p2p) cloud have become a popular solution for CoT [3], [8].
Although the elasticity of p2p model makes it ideal for CoT, the distributed nature of the data processing/storage further complicates the investigative challenges. As data synchronisation such as in BitTorrent Sync often takes place between client devices, it would not be realistic to rely on the CSPs or third parties for the collection and preservation of evidential artefacts. In such an environment, the client devices may be the only viable source of evidence (as law enforcement agencies are unlikely to have access to the cloud storage servers). The importance of collecting cloud storage artefacts from end-user devices has also been highlighted in the research such as [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The challenges are further compounded in cross-jurisdictional investigation, large-scale data processing, and deployment of encryption and mobile cloud computing. Hence, in this paper, we seek to identify potential terrestrial artefacts that may remain after the use of the newer BitTorrent Sync applications (version 2.x). Similar to the approaches of Quick and Choo [11], [12], [13] and Teing et al. [14], we attempt to answer the following questions in this research:

1.Does the act of file download using BitTorrent Sync alter the file contents and timestamps of the original files?2.What data can be found on a computer hard drive and memory after a user has used the BitTorrent Sync client and web applications?3.What data remains after a user has used the BitTorrent Sync iOS and Android apps?4.What data can be seen in network traffic?
We regard the contributions of this paper to be two-fold:

1.To provide the forensic community an in-depth understanding of the types of terrestrial artefacts that are likely to remain after the use of the newer BitTorrent Sync cloud applications.2.An operational methodology to guide forensic practitioners in examining the newer BitTorrent Sync applications.
This paper is organised as follows. In Sections 2 and 3, we discuss related work and provide an overview of BitTorrent Sync p2p cloud storage service, respectively. In Section 4, we outline the research methodology and experiment setup environment. In Sections 5 and 6, we detail the findings from the technical experiments involving the personal computers and mobile devices, respectively. Section 7 presents the network artefacts recovered. We then present our proposed operational methodology for BitTorrent Sync forensics in Section 8, before concluding the paper in the last section.
