Enterprises use data centers to expand their network capabilities and to control IT-infrastructure flexible and in real time.In this regard, a wide variety of standardized solutions appeared on the market. They allow to create efficient scalable network infrastructure of organization.
Several data centers need to be combined to a single network to expand the boundaries of existing data centers and to provide interaction of many network services. In this unified network we propose using adaptive accelerated routing algorithms to transfer traffic between data centers.
In developed approaches the main attention should be given to maximize the number of connected users, to minimize costs for the design and networks operation, to provide efficient information exchange between the different categories of users in terms of resource constraints, to provide an alternative choice of cloud communications providers. When DC are combined in single structure, an organization solves the problem of purchase additional network equipment, its geographical location and the purchase of software. Using of reserve communication links and load balancing algorithms in network between data centers allowsto support continuous operation of the network infrastructure. A particular advantage of using the combined DC is remote access, which provides access to the network structure settings from any place where the Internet is available. In this regard, we focused on the efficiency of management of data flows in distributed DC. In practice DC can be served by different telecommunications providers. Therefore the connection of more than 4 DC by primary and backup communication links will look quite difficult. So it is necessary to provide dynamic routing and fast rerouting between DC using new adaptive accelerated routing algorithms based on the paired shifts data.
