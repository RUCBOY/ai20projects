In this paper, all graphs considered are simple. Given a graph G, we use V(G), E(G) to denote the vertex set and the edge set of G, respectively. For a real number x, ⌈x⌉ denotes the least integer not less than x. For any integers a and b, we use the symbol [a, b] to denote the set {a,a+1,…,b} when a ≤ b, and [k] to denote [1, k] simply. A complete graph with n vertices is denoted by Kn.
Graphs of “Sierpiński type” play an important part in many different areas of mathematics as well as in several other scientific fields. The graphs S(n, 3) were generalized to the Sierpiński graphs S(n, k) in [11]. The motivation for generalization came from topological studies of Lipscomb’s space [16], [17]. In fact, the Sierpiński graphs were also independently studied in [19]. The graphs S(n, k) have many interesting properties and were studied from different points of view. In [13], unique 1-perfect codes in Sierpiński graphs are studied. Alternative arguments for uniqueness of 1-perfect codes in S(n, k) were presented in [4] to determine their optimal L(2, 1)-labeling. Recently, covering codes and equitable L(2, 1)-labelings of Sierpiński graphs were studied in [1], [3]. An appealing relation is that S(n, 3) is isomorphic to the graphs of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle with n disks [5], [11] and had been extensively studied in [6], [20]. In [12], S+(n,k) and S++(n,k) are introduced and the crossing numbers of Sierpiński-like graphs are completely determined. In [7], [9], vertex, edge and total colorings of Sierpiński-like graphs are studied. Moreover, the hub number of Sierpiński graphs is obtained in [15]. Besides the mentioned properties, several metric properties are also studied in [8], [18]. In [22], [23], Xue et al. investigated the Hamiltonicity, path t-colorings and the linear colorings of Sierpiński-like graphs.
Definition 1.1[11] The Sierpiński graph S(n, k) is defined as follows. For n ≥ 1 and k ≥ 1, the vertex set of S(n, k) consists of all n-tuples of integers 1,2,…,k, that is, V(S(n,k))=[k]n. Two different vertices u=(u1,u2,…,un) and v=(v1,v2,…,vn) are adjacent if and only if there exists an h ∈ [n] such that
(a)ut=vt for t∈[h−1];(b)uh ≠ vh;(c)ut=vh and vt=uh for t∈[h+1,n].
