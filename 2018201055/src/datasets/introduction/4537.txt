Brain–computer interface (BCI) aims to provide a nonmuscular communication channel between a human brain and a device. It can directly translate brain activity that encoding the human intentions into sequences of control commands [1], [2]. Due to the high temporal resolution, noninvasiveness, relatively low cost and high portability, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) become the most widely used modality for signal acquirement in BCI systems [3], [4]. The most popular paradigms used in EEG-based BCI systems include motor imagery [5], [6], steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) [7], [8], P300 event related potentials [9], [10], and their hybrid [11], [12], [13], [14], etc. In the BCI field, the SSVEP-based BCI has received growing attention during the past decade [15], [16]. The SSVEP-based BCI has the characteristic of lower training requirements and the higher information transfer rate(ITR) [17], [18], [19].
In a SSVEP-based BCI system, the visual stimuli are encoded by a single frequency or various combinations of frequencies and phase [20], [21], [22]. The command can be transmitted by recognizing which flickering target the subject attends. Because the scalp EEG is prone to be contaminated by noises and artifacts, an efficient frequency recognition method is vital for the SSVEP-based BCI systems to accurately decode the human’s intentions. In recent years, multichannel recognition methods have received increasing interest [23], [24], [25], [26], which could significantly improve the accuracy by efficiently exploiting multichannel information compared with the single channel recognition methods,such as power spectral density analysis(PDSA) [27]. The minimum energy combination (MEC) [28], canonical correlation analysis(CCA) [29] and multivariate synchronization index (MSI) [30] are the main methods adopted in SSVEP-based BCI systems. Among these three methods, MSI could achieve better classification performance than other two methods [30], [31]. For the CCA, two improved method were proposed recently, i.e., filter bank CCA [32] and transfer template based CCA [33]. These method significantly outperformed the standard CCA. A issue for the CCA is the sine–cosine reference signals which may not reflect specific information of the subjects. Zhang et al. proposed several efficient methods to optimize the reference signals, such as common and individual feature analysis based method [34], a multivariate linear regression based method [35], etc. In addition, the tensor analysis could be a useful tool to design efficient method for SSVEP-based BCI [36], [37].
For the original MSI, it measures the synchronization index between multichannel EEG signals and the reference signals [30]. The structures and characteristics of the EEG signals were not explored in this method. In fact, the temporally local structure of the samples [38], and time delayed copy of the EEG signal [39] and certain spatial and temporal features of EEG [40], have been utilized to enhance performances of the signal processing methods for BCI systems. For instance, by exploiting the temporally local information of samples, the performance of the state-of-art common spatial patterns(CSP) and MSI were greatly improved [26], [41]. And, the effectiveness of CSP was improved by considering the spectral characteristics to incorporate time delayed version of the EEG data [39], [42].
Motived by the study of Lemm et al. [39], this study contributes an extension to original MSI with the method of time delay embedding. The proposed method was termed as EMSI hereinafter. In current research, the EMSI incorporates the first-order time delayed version of the EEG data during calculation the synchronization index. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing it with the MSI on the actual SSVEP datasets recorded from eleven subjects. Results show that the EMSI algorithm could yield higher classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR).
