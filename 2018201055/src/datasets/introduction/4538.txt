Immigrating to a promising era of the Internet of Things (IoT), ubiquitously small embedded devices are implanted with various sensors to sense data from their surroundings and provide smart controlling decisions. The proliferation of miniaturized sensors and connected IoT devices is expected to reach 26 billion by 2020, most of which are wearable devices [1]. In this modern era of technology, people have started to deploy real-world IoT applications, from connected smart homes [2], connected cars [3], [4], smart parking [5], and health monitoring [6], [7] to smart utility meters [8], as shown in Fig. 1. Although IoT can facilitate different aspects of people’s lives, enabling high security, developing ransomware prevention, and establishing solutions are the key remaining concerns, given that IoT devices hold sensitive information [9].Download : Download high-res image (913KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

A HP study reveals that 70% of IoT devices are vulnerable to attacks4. Hacking of smart cars is also one of the security threats in IoT [10]. According to recent market data, the IoT security market is expected to rise to $28.90 billion by 2020, which indicates that high-security threats are expected to rise substantially in the foreseeable future5. On the other hand, ransomware continues to experience record growth in 2017. Therefore, ensuring that each device has the appropriate control to maintain data confidentiality and integrity within an organization is necessary [11]. In addition, investigation of IoT security along with data integrity holds practical significance in IoT development. Fig. 2 illustrates the security threats in IoT. Traditional security mechanisms will be unable to accommodate IoT devices completely because most of these devices have battery constraints and limited resources; however, these mechanisms require more resources [12]. Therefore, the prime focus of this study is on exposing emerging IoT threats, challenges, and potential solutions.Download : Download high-res image (1MB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 2.

In general, IoT security has been widely investigated [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]; however, to the best of our knowledge, none of the existing studies specifically focused on emerging threats and challenges, such as ransomware. In addition, several other important aspects of IoT security, which are discussed in the current study, have not been reported.
The contributions of this study can be summarized as follows.

•We initially discuss the rise of ransomware attacks and outline the associated challenges.•We investigate, report, and highlight the state-of-the-art research efforts directed at IoT from the security perspective.•We devise a taxonomy of IoT security by classifying and categorizing the literature.•A few notable reported case studies on IoT security are outlined.•We enumerate the requirements for securing IoT.•We identify and discuss indispensable open challenges in strengthening the security in IoT.•Several prominent future research directions are provided.
These contributions are provided separately from Sections 2 to 8; the concluding remarks are provided in Section 9.
