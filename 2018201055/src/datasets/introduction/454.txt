Wavelets have been successfully used in signal and image processing [1], [2], [3], [4]. In particular, the undecimated wavelet transform (also called the shift-invariant wavelet transform) denoising [5] has been used widely for signal and image denoising. Let {p,q} and {p˜,q˜} be an undecimated finite impulse response (FIR) wavelet filter bank satisfying p˜(ω)p(ω)+q˜(ω)q(ω)=1,ω∈R,where for a scalar FIR filter p={pk}k∈Z, p(ω) denotes p(ω)=∑k∈Zpke−ikω,ω∈R.Then undecimated (scalar) wavelet transform denoising of a 1-D noising signal {xk}k∈Z consists of decomposition algorithm: Ln=∑k∈Zpkxk+n,Hn=∑k∈Zqkxk+n,n∈Z,and denoising algorithm: (1.1)uk=∑n∈Zp˜nLk−n+∑n∈Zq˜nSθ(Hk−n),k∈Z,where Sθ is a shrinkage function. The hard- and soft-shrinkage functions [1], [2] are commonly used Sθ. The signal {uk}k∈Z is called the denoised signal of the original signal {xk}k∈Z.
Nonlinear diffusion filtering is a powerful method for signal and image denoising. Since the nonlinear diffusion was introduced by Perona and Malik in 1990 [6], a variety of nonlinear diffusion filters have been proposed, see e.g. [7], [8] and the references therein. High order nonlinear diffusion was also proposed and studied in [9], [10], [11].
The 1-D second-order nonlinear diffusion equation is given by: (1.2)ut=∂∂x{g((∂u∂x)2)∂u∂x},with initial condition u(x,0)=f(x), where ut denotes the partial derivative ∂u∂t of the unknown function u(t,x) with respect to t, and g is the diffusivity. When f(x) is a signal with noise, then with an appropriate choice of g(x), the solution u=u(x,t) of (1.2) (for some suitable t) is considered as the denoised signal of f(x).
The nonlinear diffusion (1.2) is discretized in practice. The following is a simple discretization using the first order difference. More precisely, let τ and h be the time and spatial step size respectively. Denote uk0=f(kh),k∈Z. Let ukj,j≥1 be approximations to the solution u(x,t) at (kh,jτ). Then uk+1j−ukjh and ukj+1−ukjτ can be used to approximate respectively ∂∂xu(x,t) and ∂∂tu(x,t) at (kh,jτ): (∂∂xu)(kh,jτ)≈uk+1j−ukjh,ut(kh,jτ)≈ukj+1−ukjτ.Hence, (1.2) can be discretized as (1.3)ukj+1=ukj+τh2g((uk+1j−ukjh)2)(uk+1j−ukj)−τh2g((ukj−uk−1jh)2)(ukj−uk−1j),for j=0,1,….
The correspondence between Haar wavelet shrinkage and second-order nonlinear diffusion has been studied in [12], which shows that uk in (1.1) is uk1 in (1.3) if shrinkage function Sθ and the diffusivity g have the relationship: Sθ(x)=x(1−4τh2g(2x2h2)).
[13] studied a relationship between multi-level wavelet shrinkage and nonlinear diffusion. In addition, [14] obtained the correspondence of coupled Haar wavelet shrinkage and 2-D second-order nonlinear diffusion.
Recently affine frames (also called wavelet frames) have been successfully used in noise removal and data recovery, see [15] and references therein. The correspondence between 1-D wavelet frame shrinkage and high order nonlinear diffusion was obtained in [16] and the correspondence in the multivariable case was studied in  [17]. The study of the correspondence led to new types of diffusion equations and helped to design the frame-inspired diffusivity functions. In addition, a relationship between 1-D multi-level frame shrinkage and high order nonlinear diffusion was obtained in [18].
Multiwavelets have been studied by many researchers, see for example [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27]. About applications and theoretical study, see [20], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47] and book [48]. A multiwavelet has two or more components. An orthogonal multiwavelet has important properties such as orthogonality, short support, and symmetry, etc. that scalar orthogonal wavelets fail to possess simultaneously. Furthermore, all the papers [42], [49], [50] showed that multiwavelets have a better performance in signal/image denoising than scalar wavelets. In addition, multiwavelet denoising has been used recently in applications including rolling bearing fault detection [51], [52], [53], [54] and study of load spectrum of computer numerical control lathe [55]. Therefore it is worth to further study multiwavelet denoising. In this paper we study the correspondence between multiwavelet denoising and nonlinear diffusion.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review multiwavelet denoising. In Section 3, we derive the correspondence between multiwavelet shrinkage and nonlinear diffusion. We also show that the multiwavelet shrinkages of the commonly used CL(2) and DGHM multiwavelets are associated with a second-order nonlinear diffusion equation. We provide some experimental results in Section 4. We draw the conclusion in Section 5.
Before moving to the next section, we provide some notations used in this paper. For a sequence P={Pk}k∈Z of matrices, we define (1.4)P(ω)=∑kPke−ikω.For a matrix M, M∗ denotes its Hermitian, the complex conjugate and transpose of M. For Qk of 2 × 2 matrix, we use qij,k denote the (i,j)-entry of Qk: (1.5)Qk=q11,kq12,kq21,kq22,k.
