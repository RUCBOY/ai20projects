Energy research needs the social sciences [42]. In a previous issue of this journal, Sovacool et al. [44] call for greater integration of the social sciences in energy research to try and overcome their current status as ‘social outcast’. They suggest this should be done through: the collection of more social science data, ‘problem-centred’ research, and the inclusion of diverse perspectives. One example of this side-lining of the social sciences3 is evident within energy demand research, with a study on ‘smart home’ technologies finding that 61% of 150 papers reviewed were led by engineering and technical sciences, with just 20% classified as social science papers [50], suggesting an imbalance in perspectives published in this area. The need to integrate the social sciences has also been recognised outside the UK (e.g. [47], [49]) and is an on-going topic of debate in this journal, including discussion of how social science can and cannot contribute to climate change and energy research [34], [36], [22]; and the limitations associated with technical framing and bringing social sciences into projects at a later stage [28], [39].
Energy demand research, which forms the empirical basis of this paper, covers areas including energy efficiency measures, behaviour change interventions, and adoption of smart energy technologies, and is an area ripe for social science contribution. More recently, opportunities for integrating the social sciences have opened up in this field, for example through the EPSRC-funded TEDDINET4 projects in the UK, the EU Energy Efficiency Projects funded under the Horizon 2020 and COST5 initiatives, and the USGCRP6 in the United States. It may be said that such projects are doing what Sovacool et al. [44] suggest needs to be done in order to better integrate the social sciences into energy research. However, working across disciplines in energy research and fostering effective collaboration is not a trivial task [39] and there is a growing appetite amongst researchers of all disciplines to understand how best to facilitate this integration [26], [51], [10], [14]. The theory of integration, and its practice in reality, are two very different things; issues which are introduced below.
1.1. Aims of the paperThis paper contributes to key debates within Energy Research and Social Science as it considers the ways in which the social sciences and social scientists can be better integrated into energy research [42], [43], [44]. By sharing the experiences of social science Early Career Researchers (ECRs) working on cross-disciplinary energy demand projects, it highlights the challenges to integration but also identifies the ways in which these challenges may be successfully negotiated. This cohort of researchers provides a unique perspective on the realities of integrating social sciences into energy research, given their position at the ‘coalface’ of research. The paper also proposes a new definition for ‘success’ in cross-disciplinary research, considering what this may look like and what this means for ECRs. Thus adding to an emerging literature on the reality of cross-disciplinary research, specifically from the perspective of ECR social scientists and the wider social sciences, and takes this further through a focus on the logics or ambitions driving integration of the social sciences. Whilst the paper focuses on energy demand and the views of social science ECRs in the UK, it aims for wider application, especially given that “real world problems do not come in disciplinary shaped boxes” [19]. Worldwide, government funding agencies have called for more information on interdisciplinary research; including what it is, whether their countries should invest in it, and whether it is being conducted effectively [29]. This paper thus has implications for cross-disciplinary teams, both internationally and in other fields of energy research, that bring together researchers from a range of disciplines to tackle the interaction of social and technical issues of energy production or consumption.
