Dynamical analysis of the system is used to describe the behavior of complex systems and hence is useful for verification and validation. Validation ensures the conformance of functional and non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements are often expensive but add quality. Non functional requirements are constraints on the system design. They may arise from user requirements, technical disciplines or the external environment. They are often “ilities”, can be divided into product or support constraints and include reliability, safety, security, etc. Therefore, safety critical systems need to be validated with respect to the non-functional requirements.
State space models are widely used to analyze non-functional requirements. However, these models are not easily understood by all stakeholders and creation of these models requires technical expertise. UML is easy to understand for all stakeholders and has a potential to capture all the requirements. But it is not capable to perform dynamical analysis for which state-space models are required. In this paper, we attempt to transform the UML model into a state space model, Petri Nets for the system dynamical analysis. Petri Net (Murata, 1989) is a graphical and mathematical tool and widely used for dynamical analysis of the systems. We validate the approach on a NPP system, known as RCICS.
The remainder of this paper is as follows: In Section 2 we give the literature survey of the methodologies for dynamical analysis of the systems along with their shortcomings. A complete case study of RCICS along with its model is given in Section 3. Section 4 describes our approach to transform UML state-chart diagrams into Petri Nets for dynamical analysis. Also, in this section, we demonstrate and validate our approach on the case study. Section 5 concludes this paper.
