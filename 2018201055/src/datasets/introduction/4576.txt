Virtual reality (VR), or virtual environment, is the synthesis of “reality” as a mean to create an intuitive way for human computer interaction. The participants in the virtual world can complete tasks which impossible in the real world. VR emphasizes real-time interaction; it is a kind of new 3D user interface. Virtual reality human–computer interaction (HCI), similar to people in the real environment and the actual objects interaction. The semantic information of the objects oriented into the virtual scene form a semantic scene. Semantic scene refers to the semantic information of objects the user is currently interacting with, including the relationship between the objects in the virtual scene and the information the object attributed to the scene. Semantic scene and the specific application of the virtual scene composed a one-to-one correspondence, though the same virtual objects in different virtual scene may have different semantics.
With the rapid development of web, virtual reality and mobile technologies and mass adoption of mobile and smart devices by all individuals in modern society, significant chances have been created for the applications of e-learning [1]. Mobile phone software which is location-based was proven to be capable to support math, geography and biology lesson for students at campuses [2]. The most advanced technologies of the video game industry makes it efficient and easy to integrate the educational aspect and state-of-the-art interface with poor interaction and graphics [3], [4]. The advanced technology in the field of video games [5] attracted great attention from the scholars to promote the motivation and participation of users, which represents to be a major concern in the design of HCI [6], [7], namely human–computer interaction. Technology enhanced learning will lead to pan disciplinary, interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary education content in various forms [8] which focus on various cultures [9]. The continuous changing environments could lead to educational benefits as the education offerings which are based on different features of individual learners [10]. Synthesizing knowledge sharing and multimedia operations also attracted attention paid by the researching community [11]. The combinations of other applied information and technology enhanced learning were taken as a rather promising researching topic [12] which has considerable practical impact. It has been promoted that the integration of IT, namely information technology and GIS, will offer impressive chances for education [13]. The principles for the 3D virtual learning design were provided in above [14]. The related process has been promoted by previous scholars in their studies [1], [15]. Furthermore, many previous studies also provoked us a lot during the research [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30].
In virtual reality technology trend, geo-spatial data visualization has never been developing rapidly [31]. With the development of VR (Virtual Reality) technology and widely applications in various areas, the requirements to VR are also increasing rapidly [32]. Virtual Reality Geographical Information System (VRGIS), a combination of geographic information system and virtual reality technology [33] has become a hot topic. Accordingly, ‘3-D modes’ has been proved as a faster decision making tool with fewer errors [34]. Meanwhile, new user interfaces with semantic computing for geo-databases is also expected [35]. With the popularity of network, the VRGIS platform based on the network environment also becomes a trend. The application of VRML, X3D and other online VR technologies have achieved networking of VR systems [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45]. For example, VRML brings interactive 3D into the Internet which the visitors can interact with it, like experience in the real environment. VRML provides a feasible solution and a description standard for the realization of the virtual reality environment. As the virtual reality modeling language based on network, VRML satisfies the basic goal to establish a 3D interactive multimedia on Internet, that is to say, it is used to describe the three-dimensional objects and their behavior. VRML treats “virtual world” as a scene, and everything in the scene is the object for VRML’s description. X3D is an open standard for publishing 3D content, it defines how to integrate the interactive 3D content in multimedia network communication. X3D is not only a kind of API program, or simply a file format for the exchange of geometric data. X3D can combine the geometric data and the run-time behavior description into a single file, and the file can be used in XML language or other different file formats. Besides, neural computing technology has been widely used in geographical information process [46], [47], [48].
WebVRGIS [32] is preferred in practical applications, especially by the geography and urban planning [49], [50], [51], [52], which is based on WebVR [53]. Urban simulation is becoming widely noticed nowadays, and some simulation systems have been developed in this area, e.g. ArcView3D Analyst [54], Imagine Virtual GIS, GeoMedia, etc. WebVRGIS engine supports steadily real time navigation in virtual scenes which are constructed with massive, multi-dimensional data from various sources [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61]. 3D urban landscape database with various data sources can be produced to implement spatial analysis and 3D visualization and published in the Internet environment [62], [63], [64], [65]. There have been several research which can assess the quality of the stereoscopic images and further improve the immersive experience [66], [67], [68], [69]. In the interactive design of the virtual environment, the connection between the function and the use of the interactive elements is built up with semantic computing. This makes it possible to achieve any kind of function and behavior on the one hand, on the other hand, the user can rely on his already known knowledge in the real world to learn the new knowledge provided by the E-learning system. Therefore, when designing an interactive VR system, it is necessary to construct and establish the semantic identity of the interactive object, so that users can understand it more easily and interact with it. In this research, we plan to use virtual reality geographic information system technology as an education and learning tool to teach the geography courses.
