Small-scale pollution events, such as the accidental or deliberate release of oil or chemicals into the environment, can arise from a number of natural and anthropogenic sources including industrial outfalls, discharges from storm water and untreated sewage. Whilst there are mechanisms in place for reporting of large-scale events, the extent and impact of small-scale pollution events is difficult to quantify. This is because these events are not consistently reported and are difficult to monitor using traditional scientific approaches due to their spatial scale and patchy distribution (Redondo and Platonov, 2009). One potential solution to improve monitoring and reporting of these events is the use of citizen science (Dickinson et al., 2012); a technique that has been used to great effect in monitoring marine environment (Hyder et al., 2015, Thiel et al., 2014) and is routinely used to monitor marine litter (Table 1), but has yet to be applied to pollution and spills.Table 1. Examples of existing citizen science projects that aim to collect data on spills and pollution.NameData collectedCoverageData availableAimsWater ReporterPollution monitoring for waterwaysGlobal (United States)YesTo keep track of local waterways and document pollution events. The site is designed and run from the United States, though reports have been received from the UK (North West London). http://www.waterreporter.org/Marine LitterWatchMarine litterEuropeYesSet up by the European Environment Agency (EEA) to help fill data gaps in beach litter monitoring required by the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). This project involves communities setting up events to record data, with an internet portal to manage events. http://discomap.eea.europa.eu/map/MarineLitterWatch/OSPAR Beach LitterMarine litterEuropeYesAssess the trends in litter for Regional Sea Conventions, MSFD, and the United Nations Environmental Programme. http://www.mcsuk.org/ospar/Marine DebrisMarine litterGlobal (United States)YesTo report where marine debris or litter is found. http://www.marinedebris.engr.uga.edu/Marine DefendersOil spills, marine debris, biological eventsUnited StatesNoTo reduce the incidence of intentionally spilled oil.

In this viewpoint, the potential for citizen science to provide data on the extent and nature of small-scale pollution events is assessed. Here the focus is on oil, as many large and small spill events can be attributed to oil of various types and are better documented. The current mechanisms for reporting pollution events are summarised and existing citizen science projects that support reporting and monitoring are highlighted. Whilst the focus of this viewpoint is on oil spills around the UK, the findings are equally applicable to many pollution or spill events.
