Global demand for rare earth elements (REEs) continues to increase due to their numerous applications in the high-tech sector [1]. Conventional ores cannot satisfy the staggering demand for these strategic elements. REEs are found in computers hard-disk drives (HDDs) [2], wind turbines, Ni – metal hydride batteries, luminophores, acoustic transducers, magnetic separators, hybrid cars, etc. [3], [4]. Recycling of neodymium (Nd) from end-of-life consumer products has attracted growing interest [5]. In this regard, several studies focused on the recovery of neodymium and praseodymium (Pr) from Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets contained in HDDs [6], [7]. Nd-Fe-B magnets typically contain ~30 wt% REEs. Besides Nd, several other REEs, such as Pr, Dy, Tb, Gd and Ho, may be found in Nd-Fe-B magnets [8], [9].
Several REEs recovery techniques have been used, such as flotation [10], magnetic separation [11], complexation [12] or solvent extraction [13], [14], [15]. In this context, membrane processes have also been considered in recent years. Some studies dealing with the extraction and separation of REEs used liquid membranes [16]. A bubbling organic liquid membrane extraction using primary amine N1923 was used to extract and enrich low concentration REEs from leaching solutions of rare-earth ores [17]. Low-concentration REEs were also extracted using a bubbling organic liquid membrane with un-saponified P507 [18]. Nanofiltration membranes [19], [20], dispersion micro-extractor membranes [21], [22] or hollow-fiber membrane extractor [23] were also considered in recovery options of REEs.
Diffusion dialysis is a well-established process for the separation of chemical species in solution [24]. It is based on the application of a concentration difference between two compartments separated by a membrane. It is a clean technique that does not require the addition of chemicals and it is energy-efficient as no hydraulic-pressure difference is applied through the membrane. Both the membrane features (e.g. pore size, surface charge density, nature of surface functional groups, etc.) and the feed solution composition impact the separation efficiency [25], [26]. Dialysis polymer membranes synthesized from mixtures of cellulose triacetate (CTA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) were shown to be low-cost materials with good separation performance [27], [28]. The addition of PEI has been widely used as it allows to form a charged layer on the membrane surface [29]. Furthermore, PEI can form complexes with heavy metals [30]. The addition of carriers, such as di-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D2EHPA), tridodecylamine (TDDA), trioctylamine (TOA) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO), in liquid membranes and polymer inclusion membranes has been successfully applied to selective extraction of metal ions [31], [32]. It is worth mentioning that D2EHPA and TOPO have also been found efficient to extract REEs by liquid/liquid extraction [33], [34], [35]. Although D2EHPA, TDDA, TOA and TOPO have been used as carriers in liquid membranes and polymer inclusion membranes, their chemical structure with a hydrophobic alkyl backbone and one or several polar groups give them also plasticizing properties [36], [37], which allows improving the membrane mechanical properties.
In this study, we investigated the possibility of recovering REEs (Nd and Pr) from electronic waste (Nd-Fe-B permanent magnets) using diffusion dialysis as a clean alternative process to liquid/liquid extraction [38]. Four dialysis CTA/PEI membranes containing D2EHPA, TDDA, TOA or TOPO were first synthesized. The membranes were further characterized by water uptake, water contact angle, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in attenuated total reflectance mode (ATR-FTIR), X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and zeta potential. Eventually, the four membranes were implemented in dialysis experiments and their ability to separate boron from REEs was evaluated.
