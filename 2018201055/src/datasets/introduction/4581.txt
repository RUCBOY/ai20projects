First successful implementations of logic structures in Escherichia coli cells, such as logic gates [1] and oscillators [2], mark the beginning of the field of synthetic biology [3]. Further development of these structures received large attention in the last 15 years [4], [5]. More complex processing systems, such as a simple biological computer, are together with one of their vital parts, i.e. scalable, robust and reliable memory structures, however, yet to be implemented. Memory structures are also of significant importance for the wider scope of synthetic biology applications. For example, memory could be used in order to identify cell populations responsive to specific events and track their progression through the cellular response [6], [7]. Moreover, logic structures can be used in a combination with biological memory to select and maintain one of the possible states of the system with fundamentally different biological functions, e.g., to implement an effective multi-state treatment from inhibition of inflammatory processes (state 1) to tissue regeneration (state 2).
Attention towards the implementation of robust and scalable biological memory has therefore been increasing in recent years. In this context we can divide the current implementations of biological memory structures in two groups, i.e. long-term memory circuits with high density, which are based on DNA recombination, on one hand [8], [9], [10], [11], and transcriptional memory devices with short-term storage capabilities, which are based on bistable genetic response, on the other hand.
Several in-vitro implementations of long-term memory circuits have been reported in the last decade [10], [11]. Few realizations of switchable and reversible long-term memory circuits have also been reported recently [8], [12], [13]. These are able to interface the logic functions with the long-term memorisation of their outputs [9]. The complexity of such circuits together with relatively long access times, i.e. read and especially write times, make them however unsuitable for current information processing applications.
Transcriptional memory devices are on the other hand less complex and have significantly shorter access time in comparison to DNA recombination based circuits. Their implementations are based on a bistable transcriptional response of gene regulatory interactions [6], which can be implemented in several ways, e.g. using single self-activating transcriptional factor (TF) [14], or either double-positive or double-negative feedback loop between two interacting TFs. An example of natural system which reflects bistable behaviour, and involves both positive autoregulation and double-negative feedback loop, is phage lambda switch system [15]. The first synthetic implementation of short-term storage, i.e. toggle switch, was performed in a similar manner using double-negative feedback loop [1]. This was later extended to a so called push-on push-off switch [16]. Short-term memory using autoregulatory transcriptional positive feedback was implemented in yeast cells [17]. Maintenance of active state of a signal pathway was achieved with the integration of autoregulatory positive feedback in the MAP kinase system [18]. Recently, yeasts cells have been used to implement multicellular short-term memory [19]. Short-term memory structures have also been implemented in mammalian [20] and even in human cells [7].
In spite of significant progress in the field of synthetic biological memory, implementation of synchronous sequential structures in biological systems is yet to be performed. These are, however, essential for the implementation of more complex biological information processing structures, since they provide synchronisation between the logic elements, which results in a robust behaviour of the system. Herein we present the computational design and analysis of biological masterâ€“slave D flip-flop, which is edge-triggered by a synchronisation (clock) signal. We apply the proposed structure to the design of a Johnson counter, which reflects robust behaviour, and can count up to 2n events using a sequence of n flip-flops. Changing the state of the counter can be triggered either with synchronization, i.e. clock signal, or with a pulse which corresponds to the occurrence of the observed event. Correctness of the proposed counter's performance is not affected by the pulse length as is the case of the state-of-the-art biological counters [21].
