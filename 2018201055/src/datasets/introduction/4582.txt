Realization of digital arithmetic operations via residue number systems (RNS) dates back to early days of digital computing [1]. Nevertheless, RNS is still in the forefront for many division- and comparison-free applications (e.g., digital signal/image processing). A residue number system is characterized with a set of often mutually prime moduli that commonly includes a power-of-two member. The next popular moduli, regarding fast and low cost arithmetic circuits, are of the form 2n ± 1, in contrast to less arithmetic friendly moduli of the form 2n ± i ±  δ(i ≥ 0,  δ > 1). For example, the classic moduli setC={2n−1,2n,2n+1}, has been outstandingly the subject of numerous studies (e.g., [8], [9], [10], [11]). The normal (N) encoding of modulo-(2n + 1) residues in [0,  2n] requires n + 1 bits, while in the diminished-1 (D1) representation [2], a residue r ∈ [1, 2n] is represented as an n-bit number r − 1 ∈ [0, 2n − 1] that is augmented with a zero-indicator bit. Notwithstanding the required zero handling and D1-related difficulties in RNS conversions, such D1 representation is known for enhancing the performance of modulo-(2n + 1) arithmetic. For example, parallel prefix D1 adders have been proposed [3], [4] that promote the latency balance with the commonly companion modulo-(2n − 1) and -2n adders. This is in contrast to the slower N adders [5], [6], and subtractors [7] that we have encountered. In order to save costs, it would be desirable to develop unified RNS adder/subtractors, but at minimal unification cost and delay overhead (i.e., one XOR gate per bit). Therefore, we are motivated to redesign D1 subtractors that approach the same latency as in the D1 adders; thus minimizing the unification overhead.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we briefly cover RNS definition, D1 encoding, and modulo-(2n + 1) D1 addition and subtraction. The proposed modulo-(2n + 1) subtraction unit and the corresponding revisited adder are presented in Section 3, while the unified add/sub module is offered in Section 4. Experimental results that confirm the analytical evaluations for the newly proposed designs and the previous relevant works are presented in Section 5, and finally Section 6 offers our concluding remarks.
