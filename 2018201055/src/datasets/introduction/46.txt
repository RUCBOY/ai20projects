The polynomial method has been receiving renewed attention since the breakthrough result of Croot, Lev and Pach [3] and subsequent follow-up results, among which the notable ones by Ellenberg and Gijswijt [6] and Naslund and Sawin [11]. A useful symmetrized formulation of this particular application of the polynomial method was provided by Tao in [13] based on a notion of slice rank of tensors. In this formulation, the size of combinatorial structures under study is upper-bounded by the slice rank of appropriately constructed tensor powers. The notion of slice rank can be interpreted in a more general framework of tensor-ranks which is given an in-depth discussion in [2].
The slice rank method has been applied to several combinatorial problems such as the tri-colored sum-free sets (see [1]), the sunflowers free sets, the capsets, and the progression-free problem. In those cases, the method gave the first non-trivial exponential bounds on the size of the considered combinatorial structures. In a follow-up note, Tao and Sawin [12] showed that the bounds derived in [6] and [11] are exponentially optimal in the context of this polynomial method. Namely, no further exponential improvement can be obtained by more refined bounds on the slice rank of the adopted tensors, since the computed upper bounds coincide with the true values asymptotically to the first order in the exponent (that is, the bounds on the asymptotic slice ranks, in the sense of [2], are tight).
A problem which has a similar flavor, but possibly a different nature, is that of determining the exponential growth of sets of trifferent ternary sequences. In this case one asks for the size of the largest subset of F3n with the property that any three distinct elements are simultaneously distinct in at least one coordinate. That is, they are projected onto F3 in at least one coordinate. This problem originates both in the context of information theory and in theoretical computer science, respectively as a problem of zero-error capacity under list decoding (or hypergraph capacity) or perfect hashing in a ternary alphabet. See [4, Prob. 10.29], [9], [5] for further details.
If T(n) is the size of a largest subset of F3n of trifferent sequences, one can prove easily by induction thatT(n)≤2(32)n. So, in this case there is already a simple non-trivial exponential upper bound on the size of the combinatorial structure, and it is rather natural to ask whether the slice rank method can be used to improve upon it. Neglecting for a moment the details of how one might try to encode the trifference problem in the slice-rank method, one is easily led to the question of whether there exists at all 3-tensors whose n-fold tensor powers have a slice rank which grows exponentially slower than (3/2)n.
In general, we ask what the smallest possible asymptotic slice rank of a tensor can be, assuming the tensor is not a slice already. The main result of this paper is to show that there is indeed a gap; any k-tensor in any field has either asymptotic slice rank 1 (i.e., it is a slice) or at least k/(k−1)(k−1)/(k). This can be interpreted as an extension of the fact that the standard asymptotic rank of matrices is either 1 or at least 2. In the case k=3, the found value is 3/22/3≈1.889>3/2, so that no straight-forward application of the slice rank method can give improvements over known bounds for the trifference problem (but see Section 3).
In Section 2 we prove our statement on the asymptotic slice rank of k-tensors. The main technical contribution is to show that all instances of the method of Tao and Sawin (which depend on tensor representation) give a trivial lower bound if and only if the tensor has slice-rank 1. In Section 3, taking again inspiration from the trifference problem, we add some comments on the limitations of our own result.
1.1. NotationFollowing [12], we consider finite-dimensional vector spaces, V1,…,Vk, over a field F and a basis Bi=(bi,s)s∈Si for each Vi, i∈[1,k], indexed by some finite set Si⊂Z. Given Γ⊆S1×…×Sk⊂Zk, a k-tensor of ⨂i=1kVi will be defined as:v=∑(s1,…,sk)∈Γcs1,…,skb1,s1⊗…⊗bk,sk. In case all the coefficients are nonzero, Γ is said to be the support of v with respect to the bases B={B1,…,Bk}. For each 1≤j≤k, we use the jth tensor product ⊗j:Vj⨂i=1,i≠jkVi→⨂i=1kVi as defined in [12] and let πj be the projection on the j-th coordinate.The notion of rank that will be discussed here is the following one: Definition 1Tensors of the form vj⊗jvjˆ for some vj∈Vj and vjˆ∈⨂i=1,i≠jkVi have slice rank one and are said to be slice tensors. The slice rank of an element of ⨂i=1kVi is defined to be the least non negative integer r such that v is a linear combination of r slice tensors.In the note [12], Terence Tao and William Sawin introduce a combinatorial way to study the slice rank of tensors. The key idea is to study the entropy of a set Γ⊂Zk defined as follows:H(Γ):=sup(X1,…,Xk)⁡min⁡(h(X1),…,h(Xk)), where (X1,…,Xk) ranges over the random variables taking values in Γ and h(X) is the Shannon entropy of the discrete variable X. In detail,h(X)=−∑αpαlog⁡(pα), where pα is the probability that X=α (we set 0log⁡0=0 by definition). Note that h(X)=0 if and only if X is constant, so that H(Γ)=0 if and only if at least one of the coordinates is constant in Γ.Using this notation, the upper bound on the slice-rank of tensors derived in [12] can be stated as follows.Proposition 1 [12]Let v be a k-tensor and let Γ be its support with respect to the bases B. Then:srank(v⊗n)≤exp⁡((H(Γ)+o(1))n). In [12], the authors also provide a lower bound on the asymptotic slice rank of a k-tensor v. At this purpose, given total orderings σ1,…,σk for the finite sets S1,…,Sk, consider the product ordering σ=σ1×σ2×…×σk. Since σ is a partial ordering, for any subset Γ we can defineΓσ:=maxσ⁡(Γ) i.e. the set of maximal elements of Γ with respect to σ. The lower bound of [12] can be states as follows: Proposition 2 [13]Let v be a k-tensor and let Γ be its support with respect to the bases B. Then, given a (product) ordering σ:srank(v⊗n)≥exp⁡((H(Γσ)+o(1))n). Proposition 2 lower bounds the slice rank of a tensor in terms of the entropy of antichain of maximal elements of its support with respect to some bases and ordering. For a given tensor, different bases and different orderings will in general give different lower bounds, and one might wonder what the best choice is. In particular, one might ask how small can the right hand side be, for some tensors, even for the optimal choice. Our main result is that either the tensor is a slice or one can choose bases and ordering for which H(Γσ)≥log⁡(k/(k−1)(k−1)/(k)). Using Proposition 2, this leads to the following result.Theorem 1Let v be a k-tensor that is not a slice. Then:srank(v⊗n)≥(k/(k−1)(k−1)/(k))n+o(n). We prove this in two steps. First we show that, for any ordering σ and finite set Γ, the quantity H(Γσ) is either zero or at least ξk:=log⁡(k/(k−1)(k−1)/(k)). The main task is then to show that, if v is a k-tensor which is not a slice, then there exist bases B and an ordering σ with respect to which the tensor support Γ satisfies H(Γσ)≠0. Hence, using Proposition 2, srank(v⊗n)≥exp⁡(ξk(n+o(n))).
