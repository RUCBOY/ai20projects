As research accumulates on the deleterious health effects of prolonged sedentary behaviour, there is a growing need to understand the correlates of the behaviours typically associated with long periods of sedentary time. We define sedentary behaviour as being: “distinct from lack of physical activity; put simply it is too much sitting, as distinct from too little exercise” (Owen et al., 2011: p. 190). For many Canadians, prolonged sedentary activities make up a large proportion of their leisure time; in 2010, Canadian adults spent an average of 20–24 h of their weekly leisure time engaging in sedentary behaviour (Anderson, 2014). This is concerning from a public health standpoint, given strong evidence supporting a relationship between sedentary behaviour and cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality (De Rezende et al., 2014, Thorp et al., 2011), and its association with a greater risk of several cancers and incidence of type 2 diabetes (Biswas et al., 2015). These health outcomes were found to be independent of those attributed to insufficient physical activity (Biswas et al., 2015).
To date, research into the correlates of sedentary behaviour has focused on children and adolescents, and on measures of overall sitting time and television time (Owen et al., 2011, Rhodes et al., 2012). Existing evidence suggests a strong relationship between an increased body mass index (BMI) and prolonged sedentary activity (O'Donoghue et al., 2016). Among Canadian adults (Anderson, 2014, Shields and Tremblay, 2008) and internationally (Ishii et al., 2013, King et al., 2010, Wallmann-Sperlich et al., 2013, Depp et al., 2010), prolonged sedentary activity during leisure time has been found to be negatively related to income (Anderson, 2014, Shields and Tremblay, 2008), being employed (Anderson, 2014, Shields and Tremblay, 2008, Ishii et al., 2013), perceived physical health (Anderson, 2014, King et al., 2010), and physical activity (Anderson, 2014, King et al., 2010, Wallmann-Sperlich et al., 2013). Findings related to the relationships between prolonged sedentary activity and age (Anderson, 2014, Shields and Tremblay, 2008, Ishii et al., 2013, Wallmann-Sperlich et al., 2013, Depp et al., 2010), gender (Anderson, 2014, Shields and Tremblay, 2008), and province/territory of residence (Anderson, 2014, Shields and Tremblay, 2008) have been mixed.
Because some sedentary behaviours can be socially interactive, identifying the social factors associated with sedentary behaviours is a necessary step in planning interventions targeting these behaviours. In our study, social support is conceptualized as a combination of five different social functions that may be obtained from relationships with others (Cutrona and Russell, 1987). These include: guidance (advice or information), reliable alliance (assurance that others can be counted on for tangible assistance), reassurance of worth (recognition of one's competence, skills, and value by others), attachment (emotional closeness from which one derives a sense of security), and social integration (a sense of belonging to a group that shares similar interests, concerns, and recreational activities) (Cutrona and Russell, 1987). Studies examining the relationship between social support and sedentary behaviours have yielded mixed results. A European study of adults found that social support was positively related to internet use, but weakly related to television watching or reading newspapers (Wangberg et al., 2008). Playing online video games was found to be associated with increased social support in an international study (Trepte et al., 2012), and a study looking at social support and internet addiction among Taiwanese adults found online social support to be positively related to internet addiction, while offline social support was protective against it (Wang and Wang, 2013).
Several mechanisms have been proposed through which marital status can affect health behaviours: shifting responsibilities can influence how people spend their leisure time, romantic partners may influence each other's behaviours by encouraging healthier habits, or being released from the marriage market might make married and cohabitating adults less likely to engage in healthy behaviours related to maintaining physical attractiveness (Robert and Wood, 2007). Being married appears to have a negative effect on physical activity (Robert and Wood, 2007, Averett et al., 2008), but evidence regarding the effects of marital status on sedentary behaviour remains equivocal. Marital status was found to be unrelated to television time in studies of Canadian (Anderson, 2014) and Taiwanese adults (Ishii et al., 2013), and overall sedentary time in European men (Varo et al., 2003). Sedentary activities found to be higher among those who are single include: screen time (time spent watching or using any electronic device with a screen) among Japanese (Ishii et al., 2013) and Canadian adults (Anderson, 2014); computer time among Canadian adults (Shields and Tremblay, 2008); and television time among American women (Teychenne et al., 2012). Conversely, overall sedentary time was found to be higher among European women who were married, divorced, or widowed (Varo et al., 2003). Married adults in America (King et al., 2010) and Hong Kong (Xie et al., 2013) have been found to watch more television than those who weren't, while American adults who were divorced or separated watched more television than those who were married (Raynor et al., 2006).
Having dependent children in the household affects how adults spend their leisure time and appears to decrease moderate to vigorous physical activity while increasing light intensity activity (Rhodes et al., 2013). Common barriers to physical activity among parents of dependent children include fatigue, lack of time, and lack of childcare (Bellows-Riecken and Rhodes, 2008), while providing care appears to increase light intensity activity and decrease sedentary time, especially among women (Rhodes et al., 2013). The presence of children in the household has been found to be unrelated to sitting and television time among Canadian (Gaston et al., 2014) and Australian (Ding et al., 2012) adults respectively, but most literature suggests that the presence of children in the household may be protective against extensive sitting (Rhodes et al., 2013, Candelaria et al., 2012, Van Dyck et al., 2010, Sanchez et al., 2008) and television watching during leisure time (King et al., 2010, Teychenne et al., 2012, Saidj et al., 2015, Uijtdewilligen et al., 2014). Having children has been associated with lower television time in American (King et al., 2010), French (Saidj et al., 2015), and Dutch (Uijtdewilligen et al., 2014) adults, and American women (Teychenne et al., 2012). Regarding overall leisure sitting time, the presence of children in the household was associated with less sedentary time among American women (Sanchez et al., 2008), and Belgian adults (Van Dyck et al., 2010). American adults (Kozo et al., 2012) with children were found to spend less time using a computer than those without in one study, but the effects on computer time have not been established and no studies were found related to video game or reading time.
A 2016 systematic review highlighted a need for research on the interactions between social correlates of sedentary behaviour with individual and environmental variables (O'Donoghue et al., 2016). Furthermore, different sedentary behaviours such as watching TV and using a computer have been found to have different correlates, indicating that different types of sedentary behaviour should be measured individually (Rhodes et al., 2012). Our study examines the associations between marital status, having children in the household, and social support on four distinct leisure time sedentary behaviours among Canadian adults, and the potential moderating effects that age and gender have on these associations. We expect to see the following relationships: people with children spending less time engaging in each type of sedentary behaviour than people without; social support being negatively related to television time and positively related to computer and video game time; and people who are married or in common-law relationships engaging in more overall sedentary time than those who are single.
