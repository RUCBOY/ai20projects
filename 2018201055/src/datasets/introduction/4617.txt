In reality, all light is partially (spatially and temporally) coherent. While fully-coherent or fully-incoherent approximations are sufficient in some cases, many situations require consideration of light's partially-coherent nature. Primarily motivated by Wolf's seminal work on the subject [1], [2], much work has been performed studying the behavior of partially-coherent light. Partially-coherent sources have been developed that produce any desired far-zone irradiance pattern [3], [4], [5], [6] and have customizable polarization and coherence properties [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. Applications of partially-coherent light are many, including particle manipulation [4], [14], remote sensing [16], [17], [18], free-space optical communication [19], [20], and inertial confinement fusion [21]. The interested reader is referred to Refs. [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] for textbooks and review papers that summarize the current research involving partially-coherent sources.
Considering their many possible applications, techniques to physically realize partially-coherent sources with desired coherence properties are quite numerous [27], [8], [14], [15], [28], [29], [30], [31], [9], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. One approach uses the coherent mode representation to generate ensembles of random pulses, where each pulse is independent of all other pulses [35], [36]. More commonly, partially-coherent sources are produced by synthesizing a set of independent, spatially-correlated complex transmittance or traditional phase screens. The desired moments (often the mean irradiance or complex degree of coherence) are computed over the set of random field instances, thus approximating the ensemble statistics. Assuming ergodicity, this approach produces the long-time field moments, which are sufficient in many scenarios. However, in some cases, modeling the time evolution of the partially-coherent source is important. Examples include high-speed detection of short-time interference, propagation of optical vortices through turbulence, and propagation of excimer beams through optical systems [37], [38], [39]. In addition, visualizing the time evolution of the source can yield physical insight not provided by the ensemble averaging techniques cited above.
Compared to the ensemble averaging approaches, techniques that model the temporal evolution of partially-coherent sources are relatively few [39], [37], [40], [38]. Of those cited, the works of Rydberg and Bengtsson [40] and Davis [38] are the most relevant to this paper. Both the method of Rydberg and Bengtsson and “the separable case” in Davis produce an instance of a field with a customizable mutual coherence function (MCF) by filtering a three-dimensional (3D) array of delta-correlated circular complex Gaussian random numbers. For computational efficiency, both groups of researchers perform the filtering operation in the frequency domain using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. The approach discussed in Refs. [40], [38] is very intuitive and permits a broad range of spatial and temporal coherence functions, but it requires a large amount of computer resources (in particular, memory) [40]. Indeed, although Rydberg and Bengtsson do present some results using the approach, the authors generally dismiss it as being too costly [40].
In this paper, three techniques to produce time-evolving partially-coherent sources are presented. The sources need not be cross-spectrally pure or stationary. The first method, the complex screen approach, is essentially equivalent to the technique discussed in Refs. [40], [38]. It is presented here for completeness, and more importantly, because the details are necessary in the development of the other two techniques, which address two of the major shortcomings of the complex screen approach. The first of these latter two methods is a phase-only (i.e., a traditional phase screen) technique. The phase screen method, easily implemented using a phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM), is well suited for applications in which control of field amplitude (required in the complex screen approach) is either difficult or undesirable. While not new [8], it has not been previously demonstrated for time-evolving source synthesis, and it is needed for the experimental portion of this work. The final approach is a novel hybrid FFT-convolution variant which is applicable to both the complex screen and phase screen techniques. The hybrid FFT-convolution method significantly reduces the computer memory required to perform a time-evolving partially-coherent source simulation or experiment while maintaining good numerical efficiency. For certain problems, this method avoids the need for resource-intensive distributed-memory supercomputers, thus offering significant practical benefits.
Section 2 presents the theory necessary to implement all three techniques for synthesizing time-evolving partially-coherent fields. Section 3 then presents numerical and laboratory results from a modified Young's interference experiment. Finally, the time-averaged irradiance patterns are compared to theory for validation.
