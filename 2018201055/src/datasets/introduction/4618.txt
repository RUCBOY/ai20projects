Quantum computers have exhibited tremendous power in algorithmic, cryptographic, information theoretic, and many other information processing tasks, compared with their classical counterparts. Meanwhile, for a large number of problems, quantum computers are not able to offer much advantage over classical ones. When and why quantum computers are more powerful are always at a central position in studies on quantum computation and quantum information processing. A particularly interesting class of scenarios is when there are, implicitly or explicitly, at least two parties involved who share a state, the correlation in this state is the key factor. What accounts for the quantum advantage is often entanglement, one of the most distinctive characters of quantum information. Indeed, it has been shown that a quantum algorithm with only slight entanglement can be simulated efficiently by a classical computer [19]. In certain potential applications of quantum algorithms, it is also shown that entangled measurement is necessary for the existence of efficient quantum algorithms [9].
Recently it was realized that entanglement is not always a necessary resource needed for generating quantum correlations. It has been found that discord, another unique character of quantum states, also plays an important role in quantum information processing [16]. Discord is a relaxed version of entanglement—states with positive entanglement must also have positive discord, but there are states with positive discord but zero entanglement. Cases have been discovered where non-classical correlations can be generated from states with zero entanglement but nonzero discord [6]. In a recent survey for discord and some related measures [12], it is mentioned that “Nowadays, there are many ways of understanding the gap in correlations, that is to say the fact that classical correlations and entanglement do not exhaust all possible correlations in quantum systems.” And indeed this has also been confirmed by some other tasks like the remote state preparation [5].
In this paper, we examine this notion from the perspective of game theory [15], which studies the situation of two or more players with each having a possibly different goal. There are two broad classes of games. One is strategic-form (or normal-form) games, in which all players make their choice simultaneously; a typical example is Rock-Paper-Scissors. The other class is extensive-form games, in which players make their moves in turn; a typical example is chess.
The research on quantum games began about one decade ago, starting with two pioneering papers.1 The first one [8] aimed to quantize a specific strategic-form game called Prisoners' Dilemma [8], and it unleashed a long sequence of follow-up works in the same model. Despite the rapid growth of literature, controversy also largely exists [3], [18], [4], which questioned the meaning of the claimed quantum solution, the ad hoc assumptions in the model, and the inconsistency with standard settings of classical strategic games. Recently a new model was proposed for quantizing general strategic-form games [22]. Compared with [8], the new model corresponds to classical games more precisely, and has rich mathematical structures and game-theoretic questions; also see later theoretical developments [11], [21], [10], [17].
Back to the early stage of the development of quantum game theory, the other pioneering paper was [13], which demonstrated the power of using quantum strategies in an extensive-form game. More specifically, Meyer considered the quantum version of the classical Penny Matching game. The basic setting is as follows. There are two players, and each has two possible actions invisible to the opponent on one bit: Flip it or not. Starting with the bit being 0, Player 1 first takes an action, and then Player 2 takes an action, and finally Player 1 takes another action, and the game is finished. If the bit is finally 0, then Player 1 wins; otherwise Player 2 wins. It is not hard to see that if Player 2 flips the bit with half probability, then no matter what Player 1 does, each player wins the game with half probability. Now consider the following change of setting: The bit becomes a qubit; the first player uses a quantum computer in the sense that she can perform any quantum admissible operation on the qubit; the second player uses a classical computer in the sense that she can perform either Identity or the flip operation [0110]. In this new setting, Player 1 can win the game with certainty! Her winning strategy is simple: she first applies a Hadamard gate to change the state to |+〉=(|0〉+|1〉)/2, and then no matter whether Player 2 applies the flip operation or not, the state remains the same |+〉, thus in the third step Player 1 can simply apply a Hadamard gate again to rotate the state back to |0〉. This shows that a player using a quantum computer can have big advantage over one using a classical computer.
Despite a very interesting phenomenon it exhibits, the quantum advantage is not the most convincing due to a fairness issue. After all, the quantum player takes two actions and the classical player takes just one. And the order of “Player 1 → Player 2 → Player 1” is also crucial for the quantum advantage. One remedy is to consider normal-form games, in which the players give their strategies simultaneously, thus there is no longer the issue of the action order. Taking the model in [22], two players play a complete-information normal-form game, with a starting state ρ in systems (A1,A2), and Ai being given to Player i. A classical player can only measure her part of the state in the computational basis, followed by whatever classical operation C (on the computational basis). In previous works [8], [13], [23] the classical player is usually assumed to be able to apply any classical operations, followed by a measurement in the computational basis. A classical operation there is implicitly assumed to be unitary, so the operation in the matrix form is a permutation matrix (such as X-gate). Here we allow the classical player to measure first and then perform any classical operation, which gives her more power since the second-step classical operation does not need to be unitary. Indeed, in Meyer's Penny Matching game, in the second step Player 2 could measure the state first and then randomly set it to be |0〉 or |1〉 each with half probability. Then in the third step, Player 1's Hadamard gate will change the state to |+〉 or |−〉, and in either case, Player 1 could win with only half probability.
Even if we now enlarge the space of possible operations of the classical player, we will show examples where the quantum player has advantage of winning the game. Furthermore, the examples have the following nice properties respecting the fairness of the game:
1.If both players are classical, then both get expected payoff 0, and ρ is a correlated equilibrium in the sense that any classical operation C by one player cannot increase her expected payoff.2.Suppose that one player remains classical and the other player uses a quantum computer. To illustrate the power of using quantum strategies, we cut the classical player some slack as follows. The classical player can (1) pick one subsystem, A1 or A2, of ρ, leaving the other subsystem to the quantum player, and (2) “take side” by picking one of the two payoff matrices, leaving the other to the quantum player.
Examples were found [23] that even with the advantage of taking side and taking part of the shared state, the classical player still has a disadvantage compared to the quantum player. Consider the canonical 2×2 zero-sum game with the payoff matrices being(1)U1=(1−1−11) and U2=(−111−1), where 2×2 means each of the two players has two possible actions, and the (k,l) entry of Ui is the payoff of Player i when the two players choose actions k and l respectively. (Here payoff means some benefit and the larger the payoff number is, the better for the player.) We will investigate the equilibria of this game for different kinds of shared states.
Quantum game with entanglement Each player i owns a 2-dimensional Hilbert space, and they share the quantum state(2)|ψ〉=12(|+0〉+|−1〉)=12(|0+〉+|1−〉), where |+〉=12(|0〉+|1〉), and |−〉=12(|0〉−|1〉). It is not difficult to verify that if both players measure their parts in the computational basis, then each gets payoff 1 and −1 with equal probability, resulting in an average payoff of zero for both players. This is a correlated equilibrium for classical operations.
Now suppose that Player 1 employs a quantum computer. Since the state is symmetric, it does not matter which part Player 2, the classical player, chooses. Let us assume that Player 2 chooses part 2, and the payoff matrix U2. Then Player 1 can apply the Hadamard transformation on her qubit, followed by the measurement in computational basis. The state immediately before the measurement is |ψ′〉=(|00〉+|11〉)/2. Therefore the measurement in the computational basis gives Player 1 and Player 2 payoff 1 and −1, respectively, with certainty. In other words, Player 1 wins with certainty, whereas she could only win with half probability when using a classical computer.
In this example where the quantum player has an advantage, the state shared by players is highly entangled, which motivates the following natural question: Is entanglement necessary for quantum advantage in the game? It turns out that the answer is no. Consider the example below.
Quantum game with discord The payoff matrices are the same as before, but the quantum state shared by players is the following.(3)ρ=14(|+〉〈+|⊗|0〉〈0|+|0〉〈0|⊗|+〉〈+|+|−〉〈−|⊗|1〉〈1|+|1〉〈1|⊗|−〉〈−|). This state is separable and thus does not have any entanglement. It can be checked that if the players measure this state in computational basis, the probability of getting each of the four possible outcomes is 1/4. Thus the overall payoff of each player is zero, and it can be verified that it is a classical correlated equilibrium.
In the quantum setting, again without loss of generality assume that the classical computer picks the second part of ρ and the second payoff matrix. The quantum player can again perform a Hadamard operation on her system, resulting in a new state(4)ρ′=14(|0〉〈0|⊗|0〉〈0|+|+〉〈+|⊗|+〉〈+|+|1〉〈1|⊗|1〉〈1|+|−〉〈−|⊗|−〉〈−|). Measuring the new state, the two players get state |00〉, |01〉, |10〉, |11〉 with probability 3/8, 1/8, 1/8, 3/8 respectively. As a result, the winning probability of the quantum player increases from 1/2 to 3/4; in other words, she gets an expected payoff of 1/2.
Note that the quantum state in Eq. (4) is separable, and there is no entanglement, but the quantum player still gets a quantum advantage. Thus, entanglement is not necessary for quantum advantage to exist in this game. Note that, however, the state in Eq. (4) has a positive discord. As we have mentioned, it was known that in some scenarios, it is discord, rather than entanglement, that produces non-classical correlations. So the above example confirms this traditional notion in the new game-theoretic setting.
These two examples were also experimentally verified recently [23]. The present paper makes further studies on the foregoing notion by asking the following fundamental question.
Is discord necessary for quantum advantage to exist in games where players share a symmetric state?
