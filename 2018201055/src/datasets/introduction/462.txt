Gliomas are the most common primary intracranial tumour, representing 81 % of malignant brain tumours and causing significant mortality (e.g., only 5 % 5-year relative survival rate with the most common glioblastoma type), morbidity, and neurological and quality of life detriment to patients [1]. Improvement in outcomes has remained mostly unchanged in nearly 20 years [2]. Delineating gliomas on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for radiation planning is a manual and time-consuming process. In recent years, significant attention has been paid to use artificial intelligence (AI) to improve this process. For example, machine learning has been used in grading prediction, estimating glioma genomics, pre-operative planning, digital pathology, tumour segmentation and much more [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]]. Tumour segmentation has multifactorial use: diagnosis, characterization, resection (pre-operative planning), radiation therapy planning, post-treatment MRI interpretation for progression versus pseudoprogression and decision for future management. In this step, machine-learning algorithms may be used for 3D volumetric measurement of the tumour and edema on MRI [4]. The advancement of machine learning based computational approaches in digital pathology to distinguish low- and high-grade glioma using digital pathology images [8] combined with imaging based machine learning approaches [7,9] have elevated the potential for computational approaches that can result in improvement in outcomes by identifying clinically relevant chemotherapy and radiation therapy treatment sensitivity and resistance relevant towards a variety of evolving therapeutic approaches [10].
One of the challenges in deriving accurate machine-learning algorithms in MRI analysis is the limited number of labelled ground truth data sets with known information and the need for large high-quality data sets [[11], [12], [13]]. Such data sets are challenging to obtain in the case of gliomas since the actual tissue is required to confirm the tumour and edema volumes and shape [14]. Current solutions have involved using multi-centre databases such as The Multimodal Brain Tumour Image Segmentation Benchmark (BraTS). Actual biopsy tissue and machine learning models trained on preoperative image data and spatially specific tumor samples have been employed to predict the World Health Organization grade [9]. Such datasets however are labour-intensive and time-consuming to create and subjective with ground-truth labels being manually created, while still insufficient to meet the increasing need for data in machine learning studies, e.g., brain tumour deep learning [[15], [16], [17]].
An alternative approach involves creating simulated tumours on the brain MRI of healthy subjects [[18], [19], [20]]. In addition to the fast and automated nature, the known label of the images is advantageous. For instance, Rexilius et al. [18] created digital phantoms of brain tumours and deformations of the brain in Gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted (T1Gad) images using a biomechanical finite element model. Prastawa et al. [19] proposed additional manipulations to generating simulated tumours using the biochemical model to tackle brain tumours that are particularly difficult to segment. With this effort, they used a modified diffusion tensor imaging to simulate tumour mass and edema on contrast-enhanced T1- and T2- weighted MRI data. Later, the group tested the reliability of the simulation method for customizing the location, count, levels of expansion and edema of the tumour [20]. These previous solutions devised to generate ‘ground truth’ datasets all require sophisticated mathematical modelling. Besides, they are not readily accessible or applicable, limiting the further development of the research.
We conduct the research to address the gap of lack of practical solutions in generating large brain tumour MRI datasets in support of machine learning algorithm developments and applications. Our pilot study has initiated the use of the Feature Manipulation Engine (FME®, an established data integration platform specializing in spatial data processing) pipelines in brain tumour simulation on MRI [21]. The FME pipelines are simple, transferrable, readily accessible, and flexible for user customization [21]. In the present study, we developed the method and application to 1) create the brain tumour-simulation workflow using FME, 2) generate multiple simulated tumour appearances onto 3D MRI using the workflow, and 3) conducted an evaluation to examine the reliability and performance of the workflow in generating simulated tumours.
