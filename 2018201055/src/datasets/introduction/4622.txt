According to American Cancer Society (ACS) and World Cancer Research Fund, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women and 14.1Â million new cases has been diagnosed worldwide in 2012. Cervical cancer arises from cervix tissues with long term infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Fortunately it can be cured at early stages. Cervix tissues undergo pre-cancerous changes over long time before true cancer cell develop, however rarely show any physical symptom. Hence, regular screening is the only way for timely detection of cervical cancer.
The Papanicolaou test (or Pap test) is the most effective screening, introduced by the Greek doctor Georges N. Papanicolaou [1], to detect abnormal changes in cervix. Fig. 1 shows examples of Pap smear images. Cytotechnologists visually examine the microscopic slides to identify abnormalities in cell morphology and structure. Visual interpretation of cervical cytology slides is a time-intensive job and requires high level of concentration from a cytotechnologist [2]. Correct interpretation of Pap smear slides faces major challenges from the quality of sampling (number of cells and overlap among the cells), smearing (presence of other elements as: mucus, blood and other debris with cervical cells), and poor contrast due to uneven staining [3]. Thus, there is a need for computer-aided diagnosis system to assist the cytotechnologists and improve the quality of Pap test outcome, which in turn decreases the cervical cancer death-rate [4].Download : Download high-res image (416KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Automatic segmentation and analysis of cervical cells has been studied for several decades by researchers to assist automated diagnostic procedures. Studies have been reported for the segmentation of cervical cell nucleus and cytoplasm [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [3], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], classification of cervical cells [3], [33] and generation of simulated Pap smear images [34]. Isolated and non-overlapping cells are the common focus in literature, however very few recent studies has taken on the challenge of overlapping cells in Pap smear images.
Precise segmentation of cell nucleus is the prerequisite and an integral part for the computer aided analysis of cervical cells and diagnostic decisions. For malignancy associated change (MAC) analysis [17], [35], accurate nucleus detection and segmentation is the essential primary step. Morphological and texture features of nucleus are the most important factors to identify normality or malignancy. As diseased, cell nucleus enlarge disproportionately, its shape may become irregular [16], or texture may change due to the change in nuclear chromatin patterns [36]. In the literature, nucleus is often used as a definite cue to locate cells. Although the segmentation and detection accuracies reported in literature are high, there are still scopes for improvement. It is evident from literature that segmentation accuracy can be improved by shape influence. This paper presents a novel circular shape constrained fuzzy clustering (CiscFC), with the aim to detect and segment nucleus more accurately from overlapping Pap smear cell images compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.
