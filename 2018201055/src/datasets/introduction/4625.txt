With the rapid development of the networked multimedia communication, the trend of sending or receiving the digital data, especially three-dimensional (3D) images has greatly increased. To protect the privacy of the authorized users and to guarantee the legal data access, information security becomes an important issue in communication and storage of images [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Ownership of multimedia data, illegal copying, avoiding duplicity and copyright protection has become the challenging issue in the age of growing internet and multimedia techniques. Watermarking techniques are widely used in information protection. According to the watermark embedded domain, these methods can be divided into two categories: spatial-domain and transform-domain techniques [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. Embedding watermarks into spatial-domain of the original image is the straightforward method. The advantages of spatial-domain methods are low complexity and easy implementation. These methods are easy implementation and imperceptibility but they are less robust to image processing attacks. In transform domain methods the original image is transformed into transform domain using discrete Fourier transform (DFT), discrete Cosine transform (DCT), discrete wavelet transform (DWT), cellular automata transform (CAT), singular value decomposition (SVD) and then watermark is embedded into these transform domains. These transform domain based schemes are highly robust against image processing attacks as compared to spatial-domain schemes. However, embedding in the lower-frequency bands of transform domain will cause the resulting watermarked image quality greatly degrades to compare with the original image.
Integral imaging (II) is employed as part of a 3D imaging system, allowing the display of full color images with continuous parallax within a wide viewing zone. II produces a true 3D image with full parallax and continuous viewing points [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24]. Computer-generated integral imaging (CGII) [25], [26], [27], [28], [29] for image watermarking is attracting a great deal of interest as it provides high processing speed and the data redundancy property of elemental images. In recent years, an image watermarking algorithm with computer-generated integral imaging (CGII) and DWT was proposed in [30], in which CGII is used to produce elemental images and the recorded elemental images as the watermark are used to embed into original images. We have also presented watermarking algorithms based on cellular automata (CA) transform and CGII [31], [32], [33].
II involves in watermarking that greatly improves the robustness of the watermark. The reason is that the property of memory distribution of elemental images. Each of these watermarking methods has its own applications and advantages. However, from these proposed literatures, we realized that, in order to obtain a robust watermark, the watermark should be embedded in the lower-frequency components of the transform domain. Generally, embedding watermark into the lower-frequency bands will cause the resulting watermarked image quality degrade. This comes from the fact that the energies of most natural images are concentrated in lower-frequency bands, and the human eyes are more sensitive to the noise caused by modifying the lower-frequency coefficients.
Hence, aside from the observations above, we claim to embed the watermarks into the “optimized domain” to serve as a trade-off for watermark embedding in the transform domain. In this paper, unlike the previous II-based watermarking methods, we make use of genetic algorithm (GA) [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] to find the optimal frequency domain for watermark embedding into our multilevel cellular automata (MCA) transform based watermarking system, which can simultaneously improve robustness and visual quality of the watermarked image. In our algorithm, a 3D scene is first captured by a pinhole array and then a two-dimensional (2D) image named elemental image array (EIA) that possesses different perspectives of 3D scene is recorded. The holographic watermark is embedded into the MCA transform coefficients of EIA. We apply GA optimization to search for optimal transform domains in order to achieve optimum performance. The experimental results have shown that the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance with respect to the II-based watermarking algorithms.
