When intense laser light interacts with solid-density materials, ionization occurs [1], [2]. In the first (inner) ionization mechanism, bound electrons are promoted to a conduction state where they can freely move throughout the solid. In the (outer) ionization stage, they gain enough energy to overcome the work function and leave the material. While they are accelerated by the laser field, electrons in the conduction state can also free further electrons through laser-assisted impact ionization or share their energy with the lattice ions via electron–ion collisions [3], [4]. This results in a modification and/or destruction of the material, which is of great interest for industrial and clinical applications, such as laser surgery [5], [6], [7], thin-film deposition [8], laser cutting and welding [9], [10], and laser-writing of channels and waveguides in solids [11], [12]. Laser heating of electrons and ions lifts the quantum degeneracy of solids and, to a good approximation, the particle interactions and dynamics can be treated classically.
Modelling the laser-driven plasma dynamics created during laser-induced material modification and machining processes  [13], [14], [15], [16] presents researchers with the difficulty of resolving light–matter interaction on both the microscopic and macroscopic length scales. Microscopic phenomena require precise knowledge of the properties and trajectories of individual particles, whereas the macroscopic scale necessitates lengths large enough to account for electromagnetic wave propagation effects. Given that the inter-atomic distance in a solid-density material is on the order of an ångström and that typical laser wavelengths are in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV, ∼100nm) to the mid-infrared (MIR, a few μm) range, bridging the microscopic and macroscopic realms requires resolving roughly four orders of magnitude in length [17]. Furthermore, a 1μm3 volume of material at solid density contains approximately 1010−1011 particles, depending on the material composition. This presents a true challenge for computer modelling. A massively parallel approach to the microscopic particle-in-cell (MicPIC) method is currently the only avenue to meet all of these requirements.
The simulation of particle systems has a history which dates back to work on diffusion [18]. Classical treatment of systems of interacting particles in more modern cases is typically done using one of two most popular methods. The first such method, molecular dynamics (MD), is well-suited to studying the dynamics in systems with dimensions on the order of a few nanometres, where the electrostatic approximation is justified. This involves ON2 operations (N being the number of simulation particles), whereby each particle is subjected to the binary Coulomb force from all the others. While this method has been shown to work well for cluster nanoplasmas [19], [20], chemical physics [21], [22], and materials science [23], [24], it does not account for electromagnetic radiation. The computational cost is also prohibitive on systems consisting of more than ∼106 particles. The hierarchical tree [25] and particle–particle/particle-mesh (P3M) [26] methods were developed to overcome this limitation but they also rely on the electrostatic approximation. MD, tree, and P3M methods are thus limited to simulate light–matter interaction in spatial domains whose size is only a small fraction of the laser wavelength, where radiation propagation effects like source depletion, retardation, and non-dipolar excitation can be neglected.
The second method, Particle-in-cell (PIC), is a veteran in the field of computational plasma physics. It is formally treated in the works of Eastwood and Hockney [26] and Birdsall and Langdon [27] (see also [28]). It improves upon MD by being O(N) and by including electromagnetic wave propagation explicitly. Charged particles or ensembles thereof (superparticles) are imposed upon a grid through the construction of weighted charge and current densities, used as sources in Maxwell equations. The electromagnetic field is then time-evolved using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method [29]. Finally, the motion of the particles is computed with the Lorentz force by interpolating the electromagnetic field at the location of each particle. In PIC, particles do not interact directly, but through the meshed electromagnetic field that contains all the field contributions from the particles. The advantage of this is the resulting O(N) scaling. However, a single PIC particle averages over tens of thousands of physical particles and its size is much larger than the atomic length scale. As a result, short range interactions, such as two- and many-body collisions, and plasma micro fields cannot be resolved adequately. Advanced PIC schemes include statistical, Monte Carlo particle collision models based on binary-collisions theories to account for the underestimated short-range particle interactions [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35]. Still, the applicability of these methods is limited to simulating the dynamics of low-density, near-collisionless plasmas.
The newer tool MicPIC [36], [37], [17] effectively combines the MD and PIC approaches in a two-stage scheme in order to circumvent the electrostatic approximation in the former and the lack of fine-grained details in the latter. Large scale effects are treated with the traditional PIC approach, where each particle corresponds to an atom, ion, or electron. For computational efficiency the size of the PIC particles is chosen much larger than the atomic length scale. When particles come close to each other, the local electric field of each PIC particle is corrected with a short-range electrostatic contribution in the fashion of MD to account for the underestimated part in PIC. The result is a fully electromagnetic simulation method capable of accounting for collisions at the microscopic scale for individual charged particles. Initially, this approach could handle a maximum of ∼106 particles in serial runs [17], [36], [37]. In this paper, we report the use of MicPIC for massively parallel simulations with up to ∼1011 particles, opening new avenues for large-scale modelling in nanophotonics, diffractive X-ray imaging, and strong-field science.
The paper is organized as follows. First in Section 2, we build on the approaches developed for PIC. The need to correct for short range interactions is novel; in addition to PIC there is the need to develop parallelization schemes for short range corrections. We discuss how MicPIC incorporates distributed memory parallelism with short range force corrections for simulations with large numbers of processes. Next in Section 3, we present a theoretical analysis of the expected scaling of MicPIC with respect to the different simulation parameters. We follow up in Section 4 by testing parallel MicPIC in different scenarios on mid and large scale supercomputer systems to assess MicPIC’s strong and weak parallel scaling characteristics, respectively. Final conclusions are given in Section 5.
