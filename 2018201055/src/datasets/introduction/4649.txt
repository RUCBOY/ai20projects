The spatial manipulation of the electron wave function has attracted much attention in recent years. Essential techniques such as computer generated holography and special beams carrying orbital angular momentum (vortex beams [1], [2], [3], [4], [5]), beams exhibiting self-acceleration [6] as well as non-diffracting beams [7] have been adapted from light optics and applied to electron beams, thereby enabling to shape electron beams with dimensions that are comparable with the size of atoms, i.e. at the sub-nanometer scale. However, up until now, all these demonstrations were spatially limited to two-dimensional shaping of the wavefunction in a particular plane, usually the focal plane of the lens that forms the desired shape. In this study we show, for the first time, how the electron beam in a standard transmission electron microscope (TEM) is spatially shaped nearly arbitrarily in three-dimensions (3D). We give examples of an intensity distribution shaped as an Archimedean spiral, and a face-centered cubic-like lattice of high intensity, focused spots. The significance of this novel tool is in its applications to particle trapping and manipulation in a volume, and the possibility of controlled, assisted-synthesis of single particles and aggregates.
The spatial manipulation of the electron wave function has taken a leap forward recently, with nano machinery such as the focused ion beam playing a pivotal role in fabrication. Thin silicon nitride membranes are widely used as substrates for electron phase manipulation, mainly due to their mechanical robustness, low scattering, and commercial availability. The authors have previously shown [8], that such phase masks may be engineered as computer generated holograms to create a desired, nearly-arbitrary intensity pattern in the diffraction plane, using an inverse Fourier transform algorithm such as Gerchberg-Saxton's [9], [10].
In this work, we present for the first time, the nearly-arbitrary manipulation of the electron wave function in 3D, with the purpose of introducing a catalyst for research in particle trapping, manipulation, and even material synthesis, using the TEM's extraordinary resolution. Some measure of control over the manipulation and rotation of particles in the TEM has already been shown [11], [12], [13], while particle synthesis using electron beam irradiation (not necessarily in the TEM) has been explored [14], [15], [16]. In his revolutionary 1970s paper, Ashkin demonstrated [17] trapping and manipulation of particles by the radiation pressure of laser light. Since then, this field has evolved enormously and includes applications in biology, chemistry, and physics [18], [19]. Shaped electron tweezers and manipulators do not only have the potential advantage of atomic resolution, but also the added value of being formed of charged particles, which may provide interesting interaction dynamics with different neutral, charged, and magnetic particles. For example, particles sensitive to electric or magnetic fields may be sorted using correctly shaped electron beams. As such, rather than shaping the beam to reform in the diffraction plane only, we design our holograms to yield an intensity pattern that follows a predetermined curve while propagating along the TEM column, or singular “hotspots”, or traps, in a lattice configuration. We've chosen two examples, based on methods developed in light-optics, to demonstrate this capability.
