Distributed Networked Systems (DNS) [1], [2], [3] have been widely existed in modern critical infrastructure, which has taken many attentions since it is transforming the economy, industry and society [4], [5]. In a smart city, due to the characteristic of high mobility and easy deployments, large number of vehicles [6], [7], [8] can be regarded as mobile data sensors [9] to obtain required information in a large area, which has formulated into a dynamic DNS [10]. The trust computing of vehicles is a pivotal aspect for DNS, since malicious vehicles may report false data, which bring new risks [11], [12]. Therefore, it is urgent but challenging to design a vehicular trust evaluation scheme to improve the data quality and enhance a high-quality dynamic DNS.
There are various kinds of data sensing tasks in a smart city, such as industrial monitoring [13], [14], agriculture monitoring, weather monitoring [15], [16] and traffic monitoring [17], [18]. Vehicles have probability to participate in the data sensing tasks. If they sense and report the required data, the service providers (SPs) need to pay rewards for the participants. The SPs can achieve required information via the vehicle-based dynamic DNS. With data analysis [19], [20], [21], the SPs in a smart city can control the physical world and provide convenient services to society. Since the quality of data sensing has direct connections with the trustworthiness of vehicles, therefore, a lot of research efforts to carry out trustworthiness management of vehicles have been conducted in the vehicle-based dynamic DNS [22], [23].
Some of the previous researches used vehicles to report required data, and optimized encryption scheme and protocol to support data sensing [24], [25], which could improve data security in transmission process. However, this kind of schemes could not solve on-off malicious vehicles because they did not consider the trusts of vehicles. Meanwhile, encryption and decryption would take a long time, which could increase data delay. By third party monitoring [26], [27], some of the previous schemes proposed that vehicles with better historical performances could be selected as mobile data sensors [28]. Those approaches had efficiency at the beginning. However, after multiple rounds of trust evaluations, the vehicular trust values tended to be the same. Meanwhile, data in some vehicle sparse regions is hard to be obtained. Based on the above approaches, the main objective of this paper is to design a vehicular recruitment framework that can select trustworthiness vehicles to avoid onâ€“off malicious vehicles and can improve coverage ratio of data sensing.
Based on previous vehicular recruitment approaches [29], [30], therefore, this paper proposed a general trustworthiness-based evaluation scheme (TVRS) for information collections in the vehicle-based dynamic networks, which aims to analyze trusts of vehicles and achieve high-quality information. Considering the time factor and the gap between real data and sensed data, trust value of vehicles can be derived accordingly. Then, to inspire data sensing, a trustworthiness-based gradient pricing method is also designed to pay rewards for the vehicular participants. The main contributions of the proposed scheme are summarized as follows.
(1)Firstly, by utilizing the data-driven technology, a trust evaluation scheme is designed to calculate the trust values of vehicles. There, considering the influences of time factor and the gap between sensed data and real data, a penalty mechanism is designed to evaluate the performances of vehicular sensors. If a vehicular sensor can sense data with high accuracy in a short period of time, the performance score of this vehicle will be high. And this vehicle has a higher trustworthiness value. To keep the performance score of all the vehicles between 0 and 1, an evaluation function is designed to comprehensively evaluate trustworthiness of vehicles. With multiple round of evaluation, vehicles with top trustworthiness values can be obtained.(2)Secondly, a trustworthiness-based gradient pricing method is designed to pay different rewards for vehicles with different data-sensing contributions. There, the SPs publish tasks to the vehicles with higher trustworthiness values. There are few vehicles in some regions; and vehicles can choose whether to participate in the sensing tasks. Clearly, sensing data in the vehicles sparse regions has greater contributions for the whole task. Therefore, it is necessary to design a method to inspire vehicle participants. Thus, the trustworthiness-based gradient pricing method is proposed to improve the rewards in the vehicle sparse regions. Vehicles are more willing to take part in the published tasks, which improves coverage regions of data sensing.(3)Finally, the experiments are conducted with our proposed scheme, using real vehicular GPS datasets from the Beijing city. The extensive simulation results demonstrate that the TVRS scheme can improve quality of data sensing and can improve coverage ratio of data sensing at the same time.
