A thriving computer design industry is enormously reliant on CAD based design automation tools for designing computing systems. The CAD tools are used in multiple abstraction levels of a computing system design. For example, a CAD based high level synthesis tool is used for automatically generating a schedule and datapath of an application usually specified in the form of a control data flow graph. Every step of such a CAD HLS tools runs in the background complex algorithms for performing pre-processing, high level transformation, code optimization, design space exploration, scheduling and resource hardware allocation. The output of such CAD HLS tools is a soft reusable IP core in the form of a scheduled graph or datapath of the application. The soft IP core generated is an extremely important component of a computing system design owing to its multi-fold advantages such as reusability, higher productivity and lower design time. A reusable IP core is product expensive manpower investment, intelligent algorithms and intellectual information (developed over several decades) which needs robust protection against threats at minimal design overhead. However not many HLS algorithms inside these CAD tools explicitly consider protection aspect of soft IP core as an important mandate, thus exposing risks of theft and counterfeit. Protection of IP cores may be achieved through watermarking, steganography based methods, forensic engineering etc. [1], [2], [3], [4], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. Therefore ensuring robust protection and minimal design overhead during devising algorithms for CAD HLS tool are critical. This guarantees generation of soft reusable IP cores from HLS tools that are embedded with protection feature such as watermarking, capable of safeguarding against ownership theft and counterfeit [5], [6], [7], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16].
Reusable IP cores provide an optimal balance between achieving higher design productivity and lower design time for computing systems. As part of the global design chain IP cores invite ownership and piracy threats which demand protection at low overhead. State of the art presents IP core protection techniques mostly at lower levels of design abstraction, however they are not beneficial for reusable IP cores used during design at higher level of abstraction (such as high level synthesis) [4], [5], [6], [7].
