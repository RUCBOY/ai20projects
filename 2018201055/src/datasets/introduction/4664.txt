In recent years, and in line with Moore's Law the number of standard CMOS technology gates on chips has increased rapidly. More operations are being performed by a larger number of gates because of an enormous increase in computational speed, and the reduction in the size of integrated circuits on chips which has resulted into more power being consumed [1]. Whatsmore, according to Landauer's research, the constructing of circuits and systems utilizing traditional classical gates has resulted in energy dissipation as a result of information loss during computation since they are irreversible in nature. Landauer has shown that each bit of information lost generates kTln2 joules of heat energy, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T the absolute temperature at which the computation is performed [2]. In 1973, Bennett, showed that utilizing reversible logic leads to a reduction in power consumption as well as energy loss in the computational process [3].
A great deal of attention has been given to reversible logic in recent years. Systems and circuits based on reversible gates can be utilized on chips for reducing energy loss. Since, quantum gates are reversible in nature, reversible logic gates are n-input n-output with one-to-one mapping [4], [5], [6]. This means that a reversible gate has an equal number of inputs and outputs, in addition, the input vector can be uniquely recovered from the output vector. Quantum reversible circuits are feedback-free and fan-out-free [7].
Multiple-valued logic has long attracted the attention of digital system and logic designers due to the fact that Multiple-valued logic is necessary for solving the problems on binary systems because when compared to binary digital systems, these circuits have the potential to reduce the size of a chip through the implementation of internal connections and functions [8]. Multiple-valued logic represents one type of n−dimensional quantum system with the basis state |0⟩, |1⟩, . . ., |n − 1⟩. The information unit in a multi-valued quantum system is called a qudit [9]. Muthukrishnan and Stroud showed the realization of d-valued (d > 2) quantum gates using a liquid ion-trap [10].
The significance of ternary logic has been emphasized by many researchers. Ternary logic is a multiple-valued logic in which the logic levels are 0, 1, and 2. A ternary quantum computer is viewed as a ternary quantum system composed of ternary quantum logic gates, in which each gate performs an elementary unitary operation on three-state quantum systems called a qutrit. Each qutrit represents an elementary unit of information [11], [12] and the ternary reversible gates is realized under the context using trapped ions [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13].
A subtractor is the major component of the ALU of a classical computer and is also used in oracle. Binary reversible subtractors from conservative gates are presented in [14], [15], [16], [17]. The main factors regarding the designing of ternary reversible circuits design are defined as below:

•Total quantum cost refers to the cost of the circuit and is calculated according to the number of ternary shift gates required to realize the circuit [18].•Total hardware complexity refers to the complexity of the circuit in which ε indicates a ternary 1-qutrit shift gate calculation complexity and γ indicates a ternary 2-qutrit Muthukrishnan-Stroud gate calculation complexity.•The number of constant inputs refers to the number of inputs to be maintained constant at 0,1 or 2 in order to synthesize the given logic function.•The number Garbage outputs refers to the number of unutilized outputs to maintain the reversibility of the function but do not perform any useful operations.•Delay time refers to the delay of the circuit and is calculated according to the logical depths required to realize the circuit, the delay of each ternary 1-qutrit shift and 2-qutrit Muthukrishnan-Stroud gates is taken as unit delay called Δ.
The minimization of these parameters will lead to better efficiency of the ternary quantum reversible logic design [19], [20]. Subtractors circuits are necessary for the designing of basic quantum computers, quantum realization of ternary subtractors were given in [21], [22]. In this paper, the authors have developed the quantum realization of a ternary subtractor circuits using ternary shift and Muthukrishnan–Stroud gates in addition to showing how the proposed designs have better advantages over the previous designs [21], [22].
