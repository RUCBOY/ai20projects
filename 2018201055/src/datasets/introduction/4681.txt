The shape is an object property which has a big discriminative capacity since it allows many numerical characterizations. One of common approaches is to observe certain shape descriptors/properties (e.g. convexity, elongation, compactness, sigmodaility, etc.) cognizable and distinct for a certain application, and then develop methods for their numerical evaluation. Such evaluation methods herein are called shape measures. There are many shape measures developed so far. Just to mention some of them: convexity [23], circularity1 [17], [22], [33], linearity [9], [26], tortuosity [10], but there are many more. As it can be seen, there are shape descriptors with multiple measures developed for their numerical evaluation. This is as expected since there is no shape measure performing well in all applications. The shape ellipticity, which is the main subject of this paper, also has multiple measures defined for its computation. Notice that by the shape ellipticity we mean the similarity of a given shape to the planar region bounded by an ellipse. It is worth pointing out that the object/shape ellipticity is a recurrent topic in research, due back to 1910 (see [27]) till the most recent days [16], and many more, e.g. [24], [32], just to mention two of them. A lot of work has been dedicated to solve the appearing, ellipticity associated, problems. Here we mention [13], [14], [19], [21], from the areas of the astronomy, astrophysics, nano-particles analysis, and traffic analysis.
Apart from the shape measures mentioned, there are generic shape measures which are targeted to satisfy some of desirable properties (e.g. the invariance with respect to a class of transformations), rather than to evaluate some of shape properties. Among them are: Fourier invariants [29], different kind of moment invariants [5], [11], [30], [31], integral invariants [12], shape-illumination invariants [2], and so on. The power of generic shape invariants comes from the fact that the number of such invariants is not upper bounded. A drawback is that their behavior is not well explained and cannot be predicted.
There another approaches, as well, to the shape analysis problems. Here in we mention statistics based ones (the topic usually named the statistical shape analysis. An idea [4] was to learn the space of typical shapes, from examples of a class of shapes (i.e. training data). This can then be used to analyze new shapes, e.g. measure the probability the new shape is a member of the shape class, or transform the new shape by projecting it into the learnt shape space. A statistical appearance model, that uses a probabilistic correspondence (rather than one-to-one correspondences, for example) has been considered in [15]. A learning statistical shape model from image data, has been proposed in [8]. The model uses Kendal shape space, represents shapes as point set equivalence classes, and treats each shape point set as a random variable. A method for constructing statistical representations of ensembles of similar shapes is described in [3]. The method is based on an optimal distribution of a large set of surface point correspondences (the method uses surface point samples rather than any specific surface parameterization). Current (a generalized distribution, coming from geometric measure theory) based method for computing an optimal deformation between surfaces embedded in 3D space is given in [28]. The method leads to a diffeomorphic matching algorithm, with an immediate application in statistical inference of shapes, via momentum representation of flow.
As it could be expected, the measures which do relate to certain shape property have a well understood and predictable behavior, but their number is limited. This further causes a limited discriminative power of such measures. An attempt to balance between these two issues has been made in [1], where a tuning parameter ρ ∈ (0, 1] was involved to design an infinite family of ellipticity measures Eρ(S). All measures, from the family Eρ(S), with 0 < ρ ≤ 1, are invariant with respect to translation, rotation, and scaling transformations and range over the interval (0, 1]. For a fixed ρ ∈ (0, 1], the equality Eρ(S)=1 is true if and only if the shape S is the ellipse whose the axes length ratio is ρ. Thus, the ellipticity measures Eρ(S) distinguish between ellipses whose axes length ratios are different – i.e. such ellipses are considered to be different in shape, as well.
The results of [1] are actually the starting point for the work of this paper. We start with the derivation of an explicit and closed formula for Eρ(S).2 This enables a fast computation and more detailed theoretical observation of the properties of the measures from the family. Based on these observations we discover new shape measures/features, not discussed before in the literature:

•Average ellipticity,Eavg(S), is defined as the average score of the measured ellipticities Eρ(S), while ρ varies through an interval (a, b], with 0 < a < b ≤ 1.•Maximum ellipticity, Emax(S), is defined as the maximal value among all the ellipticity measures Eρ(S), with 0 < ρ ≤ 1. Formally: Emax(S)=maxρ∈(0,1]Eρ(S).3
Some of the obtained results strongly relate to the well-known results that are already in common use in image processing and computer vision tasks. This will be discussed in more details later on. Several illustrative examples are provided, in order to support a better understanding of the theoretical observations made in this paper.
The paper is organized as it follows: Section 2 gives the basic definitions and denotations. Explicit formulas for the computation of the Eρ(S),Eavg(S), and Emax(S), measures and related comments are Section 3. Concluding remarks are in Section 4.
