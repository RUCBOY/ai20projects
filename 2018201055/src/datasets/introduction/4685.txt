By non-invasively providing high-contrast human anatomic information, X-ray CT has become an important tool in radiological examination since its introduction in 1970s. However, accumulated radiation doses due to repeated X-ray CT examinations can induce cancer and other diseases in human bodies [1], [2], [3]. The quality of CT images being dependent of the radiation dose [4], how to improve the image quality under low dose CT scanning has become a major research topic. Generally, there are two main approaches to reduce the X-ray radiation dose, which are lowering the tube current (or voltage) values and sparse-view scanning. Lowering tube current (or voltage) unavoidably leads to less effective photons and to increased noise in projection data (or sinogram) and consequently degrades the quality of reconstructed images. Much work has been conducted to obtain clinically acceptable CT images from low dose projection data, and the main solutions include sinogram data restoration [5], [6], statistical reconstruction [7], [8], [9], and image based post-processing [10], [11], [12].
Reducing the number of projections is another solution. Sparse-view reconstruction leads to low radiation doses as well as faster reconstruction. But, by doing this, the original inverse problem becomes more and more ill-posed. Severe streak artifacts in CT images can be observed when using for instance the Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstruction algorithm. Compared with FBP algorithm, iterative methods can improve the image quality by modeling the measurement statistics and the imaging geometry. However, due to the underdetermined linear system with sparse projections, the reconstruction obtained this way is still far from being satisfactory [13]. Recently, a special attention has been devoted to compressed sensing (CS) theory [14], [15], [16], [17]. Studies on CS theory unveil the possibility of recovering from sparse signals when the requirement specified by the Nyquist sampling theorem cannot be satisfied [14]. CS has been extensive applied in pattern recognition and computer vision, such as machine learning [18], [19], sparse coding and regression [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], image segmentation [25], [26], and so on [27], [28]. In the field of medical imaging, CS theory has been successfully considered in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with sparse sampling [29], [30], spectrally resolved bioluminescence tomography [31], optical coherence tomography [32].
CS theory assumes that sparse-distributed gradient information can be used to regularize tomographic reconstruction by minimizing a constrained TV function [14], [33]. Although the restricted isometry property (RIP) condition is not often satisfied in practice, CS theory based reconstruction can yield more satisfactory results than the traditional FBP algorithm in sparse-view CT reconstruction [34]. In [35], Sidky et al. developed a TV minimization algorithm for 3-D divergent beam CT reconstruction with limited projections. Chenâ€™ group suggested a prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS) to reconstruct dynamic cardiac CT images from highly under sampled projections, where the gradient difference between the target image and a high-quality prior image is incorporated [36], [37]. Lu et al. proposed a dual dictionary algorithm for CT image reconstruction from limited projections [38]. It was also pointed out that, as to a piecewise constant object, a region of interest (ROI) could be exactly and stably reconstructed via the TV minimization [39]. Recently, Liu et al. proposed a total TV-stokes based method to improve sparse-view X-ray CT reconstruction [40]. Liu et al. proposed an algorithm, which combines a first order primal-dual and a projection onto convex sets (FOPD-POCS) to solve the TV minimization problem [41].
Theoretically, the l0-norm can provide a sparser representation than the TV. But the reconstruction using l0-norm regularization is a NP hard problem due to its nonconvex function in discontinuous form [14]. The application of l0-norm regularization has already been explored in sparse-view CT reconstruction. Guo et al. proposed an EdgeCS (edge guided CS reconstruction) where a truncated TV regularization is applied to preserve those edges with gradient values larger than some specified threshold values [42], [43]. Lee et al. formulated the imaging problem as a joint sparse recovery problem under CS framework and proposed an exact inversion algorithm that achieved the l0 optimality as the measurement rank increases [44]. Hu et al. developed an approximate l0-norm constrained sparse reconstruction algorithm for 3-D CT reconstruction [45]. Zhang et al. proposed a Gamma regularized CT reconstruction [46].
The contributions of the present work can be featured as follows. Firstly, the Gamma regularization is extended to the sparse-view CT reconstruction to get an improved reconstruction performance over the general l1-norm based TV reconstruction. Secondly, the convexity property of the regularization term is thoroughly analyzed to show that the cost function can be monotonically decreased with ensured local minimum solution in the proposed algorithm. Thirdly, the proposed reconstruction is shown not sensitive to initial conditions. Experiments point out that the Gamma regularization leads to better reconstruction results than the cases using l2-norm and TV regularizations.
In Section 2, the sparse-view CT reconstruction model and Gamma regularization are reviewed. The optimization of Gamma regularization based sparse-view reconstruction model and the related parameters setting are given in Section 3. The performance of our model is assessed on simulated and clinical data in Section 4. A discussion is provided in Section 5 and concluding remarks and perspectives are sketched in Section 6.
