Let χ be a nontrivial additive character from Fq to the nonzero complex C⁎. The Weil bound for character sums states that, when the degree m of a polynomial f(x) is co-prime with q, then |Ex∈Fq(χ(f(x)))|⩽(m−1)/q. The Weil bound for character sums can be derived from the Hasse–Weil bound of a special family of algebraic curves, i.e., yp−y=f(x), where p is the characteristic of Fq. Therefore, any improvement on the Hasse–Weil bound of this family could lead to an improvement on the Weil bound for character sums. The Hasse–Weil bound is a deep result in mathematics and has found wide applications in mathematics, theoretical computer science, information theory etc. In general, the bound is tight and cannot be improved. However, in some special cases the bound could be improved substantially. For instance, when the ground filed size q is small, the bound could be improved up to half of it. There have been various improvements on the Hasse–Weil bound. One of the most famous improvements is the Weil–Serre bound [10]. In 1993, Moreno–Moreno [7] gave an improvement to the Hasse–Weil bound for this family of curves. Recently, Kaufman and Lovett [4, FOCS2011] showed that the Weil bound for character sums can be improved for f(x)=g(x)+h(x), where g(x) is a polynomial of degree ≪q and h(x) is a sparse polynomial of arbitrary degree but bounded weight degree. The other recent improvement by Rojas-Leon and Wan [9, Math. Ann. 2011] shows that an extra p can be removed if p is very large compared with polynomial degree m of f(x) and logp⁡q.
1.1. Our resultFrom now on in this paper, we assume that q=2n for an odd integer n⩾3. Consider the trace map Tr from Fq to F2 defined by α↦∑i=0n−1α2i. It is easy to see that Tr(α2t)=Tr(αt). This implies that, for a polynomial f(x)∈Fq[x], one can find a polynomial g(x)=∑i=0mgixi∈Fq[x] such that gi are zero whenever i≡0mod2 and Tr(f(α))=Tr(g(α)). Thus, we only consider those polynomials with nonzero term xi, where gcd⁡(i,2)=1.Now let f(x) be a polynomial of degree m⩾1 over Fq. Without loss of generality, we may assume that gcd⁡(m,2)=1. We consider the cardinality of the set(1)Zf:={α∈Fq:Tr(f(α))=0}. Then the Weil bound shows that(2)||Zf|−q2|⩽(m−1)q2.The main result of this paper is given below. Theorem 1.1 MAIN RESULTLet g=(m−1)/2 with m⩾3, then one has(3)||Zf|−q2|⩽{2⌈n/g⌉−1⌊g⌊2q⌋2⌈n/g⌉⌋if g>12(n−1)/2⌊⌊2q⌋2(n+1)/2⌋if g=1.One could not see how largely the bound (2) is improved in Theorem 1.1. Essentially, the bound (3) tells that the number |Zf|−q2 is divisible by 2⌈n/g⌉. We refer to Example 2.2, Sections 2.3 and 2.4 for numerical illustration.
1.2. Our techniqueOur technique for the improvement is through L-polynomials of algebraic curves with the Hasse–Witt invariant equal to 0. More precisely speaking, we show the improvement through two steps: (i) prove that the Hasse–Weil bound for the algebraic curve with the Hasse–Witt invariant 0 can be improved; (ii) show by the Deuring–Shafarevich Theorem that the curve y2−y=f(x) has the Hasse–Witt invariant 0. Consequently, we obtain an improvement on the Weil bound for character sums.Among the above three steps, the critical one is to show an improvement on the Hasse–Weil bound for the algebraic curve with the Hasse–Witt invariant 0. In order to achieve this, we analyze the Newton polygon of the characteristic polynomial of an abelian variety with Hasse–Witt invariant 0. Then we employ some fundamental results on factorization of the characteristic polynomial to obtain the desired result.
1.3. ComparisonWe mainly compare our improvement with those by Serre [10], Moreno–Moreno [7], Kaufman–Lovett [4, FOCS2011] and Rojas-Leon–Wan [9, Math. Ann. 2011].The improvement by Serre applies to arbitrary algebraic curve over F2n with odd n, while our improvement only applies to the curve y2−y=f(x) over F2n with odd n. On the other hand, our improvement is even greater than the one by Serre for this special family of curves. The method by Serre mainly employs some properties of algebraic numbers.The improvement by Moreno and Moreno shows that |Zf|−q2 is divisible by 2⌈n/m⌉, while our result in fact shows that |Zf|−q2 is divisible by 2⌈2n/(m−1)⌉. This leads to a better improvement.The improvement by Kaufman and Lovett works for those polynomials with degree bigger than q. Thus, the scenario is different. The main idea by Kaufman–Lovett uses the Deligne Theorem on multivariate polynomials.The improvement by Rojas-Leon and Wan shows that, for number of points on the curve yp−y=f(x) over Fpn with f(x)∈Fp[x], an extra p can be removed if p is very large compared with polynomial degree m of f(x) and n. However, our improvement works for characteristic 2 which is not applicable in [9]. The idea of Rojas-Leon and Wan involves moment L-functions and Katz's work on ℓ-adic monodromy calculations.
1.4. OrganizationSection 2 presents the main result and some applications to character sum, cryptography and coding theory. We also show that the Weil bound for character sums can be derived from the Hasse–Weil bound for y2−y=f(x) in Section 2. We present the proof of the main result in Section 3 by adopting some results on the Newton polygon and abelian varieties.
