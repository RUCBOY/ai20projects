There have been numerous studies of the strengthening of crystallographically ordered alloys by disordered precipitates. Most have involved ternary or multi-component so-called inverse Ni-base alloys, with the L12 γ′matrix strengthened by disordered fcc γ precipitates. These include the investigations of Ham et al. [1], Tian et al. [2], [3], [4], [5], Pretorius et al. [6], Nemoto et al. [7] and Yasuda et al. [8], who all investigated the strengthening of ordered γ′-Ni3(Al,Ti). Liu et al. [9], [10], [11], [12] and Pretorius et al. [13] studied the strengthening of several inverse γ/γ′ alloys, including (Ni,Co)3(Al,Ti), (Ni,Co)3(Si,Ti) and Ni3(Si,Al,Ti). The only work of this kind to date on a binary alloy is a study by Nemoto et al. [14] of ordered γ′-Co3Ti strengthened by fcc Co-precipitates. Experiments on other systems, not Ni-based, include those of Hovan and Ardell [15] and Ibrahim and Ardell [16], [17], who investigated precipitation hardening of an ordered Cu3Au matrix strengthened by f.c.c. Co-rich precipitates, and Pattanaik and Ardell, who studied the dispersion strengthening [18] and work-hardening behavior [19], [20] of internally oxidized Cu3Au alloys containing amorphous SiO2 particles. Tian et al. [21] investigated the hardness of inverse B2-ordered NiAl strengthened by coherent disordered bcc α-Cr particles. In many of these alloys the increase in hardness, yield strength or critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) is quite significant, approaching 140% in alloys containing as little as 4% of γ-phase precipitates [7].
In all the alloys noted above, except for the work of Pattanaik and Ardell [18], [19], [20], strengthening involves interactions between superlattice dislocations and coherent, crystallographically disordered precipitates. This process is somewhat analogous to stacking-fault strengthening if the stacking-faults separating dissociated partial-dislocation pairs in fcc crystals are replaced by the anti-phase boundaries (APBs) that separate super-dislocation pairs in an ordered L12 matrix. Instead of precipitates with stacking-fault energies that differ from those of the matrix phase, disordered precipitates have APB energies equal to zero. When a superlattice dislocation shears a coherent disordered precipitate there is no attractive APB force inside the precipitate to counteract the mutual repulsion of the individual dislocations in the pair. Super-dislocations in an ordered matrix are therefore attracted to disordered precipitates because the APB inside them vanishes. It seems reasonable to call this mechanism “disorder” strengthening, which is the sensible analog of stacking-fault strengthening (SFS).
The first theory of SFS was proposed by Hirsch and Kelly (H-K) [22]. Subsequent models of SFS [7], [23], [24] have taken into account the limitations of the original theory, which were first pointed out by Brown and Ham [25]. One distinctive analytical model of “disorder” strengthening of ordered alloys, based primarily on the approach of H-K, was published by Tian et al. [4] and Nemoto et al. [7] in Japanese and English language versions, respectively, but these authors recognized that their theory was approximate and that certain factors were not properly taken into account. Another quantitative theory was proposed a few years later by Pretorius and Nembach (P-N) [26], the predictions of which differ from the H-K-based theories primarily because of different assumptions regarding the configurations of the leading and trailing dislocations inside the precipitate. The P-N approach is based on the dislocation configurations postulated by Nembach et al. [24] in a paper re-visiting the problem of SFS. In this paper we re-examine the theoretical work done to date and propose new equations for the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS), τc, derived from the H-K and P-N approaches. We use as a foundation the equations suggested by Ardell [27] to deal with SFS. Limited success along these lines was obtained by Rao et al. [28] to explain computer-simulated precipitation strengthening of an inverse superalloy. In a companion paper to be published [29] we apply the theory developed herein to the precipitation strengthening of a binary Ni3Al alloy by Ni-Al precipitates.
