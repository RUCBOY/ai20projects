The meteoric rise of social media—which are “highly interactive platforms…[through which] individuals and communities share, co-create, discuss, and modify user-generated content” (Kietzmann, Hermkens, McCarthy, & Silvestre, 2011, p. 241)—prompts questions about their impact on individuals and society. The number of active social media accounts exceeds two billion worldwide (Statista, 2016). People of different age groups increasingly turn to social media not only for social connection, but also to obtain and exchange news and information (Pew Research Center, 2015, Statista, 2015). It is a pressing question how this trend affects the use and relevancy of other information sources, particularly tax-funded institutions such as public libraries (Hernon & Schwartz, 2015). It is not uncommon to see public expressions which question the value of public libraries, citing that socio-technological developments have, or will soon, render libraries obsolete (Siegler, 2013, Worstall, 2014).
