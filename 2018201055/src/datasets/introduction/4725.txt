Temperature field is one of the most convenient parameters commonly used to study the flow characteristics in the research of heat transfer enhancement [1], [2], especially in terms of micro heat sinks with complex structure [3], [4]. Characterization of temperature field uniformity has received increasing interest in recent years [5], [6], [7]. However, no single universally and formal quantitative definition of temperature uniformity is hitherto available.
One main drawback of classical estimation of temperature field distribution in the most heat transfer investigations is the subjectivity of the measurement interpretation. Indeed, the distribution of temperature field is typically determined with the naked eyes or the researchers’ sensory experiences and may yield different results if the same temperature field is in front of different individuals or observed many times by the same operator. It is important to have a quantitative measure of temperature uniformity by computers without human intervention. Besides, rapidly advancing flow imaging technologies provide powerful tools to help address the above question. Studies in flow visualization, vision measuring and image processing are greatly facilitated by a variety of flow imaging technologies, including electrical resistance tomography [8], position emission tomography [9], magnetic resonance imaging [10], and electrical capacitance tomography [11], [12], [13], among other tomographic techniques. During the past many decades, considerable attention has been devoted to apply the technologies to the physical fields [14], such as temperature and concentration fields.
A literature survey showed that image analysis has been used to circumvent the subjectivity problem of the concentration field and developed with various degrees of success [15], [16]. For instance, Cabaret et al. (2007) proposed a new technique relying on image analysis to characterize the macro mixing of an impeller in a transparent stirred tank; on the basis of their experimental validations, this method was highly reproducible and robust [17]. Moreover, statistical image analysis is more complicated [18], [19]. For instance, Zhou et al. (2013) developed a general statistical framework for image analysis [20]. They noted an increasing trends and demands of using image processing technology for characterization of subjective human experience [21], [22]. Recently, Fei et al. (2105) and Xu et al. (2016) presented two straightforward methods (Uniformity Coefficient method and Modified Uniformity Coefficient method based on Uniform Experimental Design) for assessing the bubbles uniformity and mixing quality in a direct-contact heat exchanger. The space-time features of the mixing process have been successfully derived by the former method [23], whereas the later exhibits some advantages such as permutation invariance, rotation invariance (reflection invariance) and the ability to measure projection uniformity [24]. The three existing image analysis methods including the standard deviation method [25], the coefficient of variation method [26] and the image entropy method [27], [28] have the inherent advantage of non-intrusive for measuring field uniformity. On the other hand, the approaches remain sensitive to the location of objects in temperature fields. That is to say the time space and position information (TSPI) of objective has not been taken into account in these methods. Hence, further investigations of the engineering characteristics relevant to distribution uniformity of temperature field by means of image analysis are still lacking in a way.
The uniform design proposed by Fang and Wang scatter points uniformly over the experimental domain [29], [30]. Without loss of generality, suppose there were s factors of interest (dimension of experiment region) over a standard domain Cs=[0,1]. The key issue was to choose a set of N points X={x1,⋯,xN} such that these points were uniformly scattered on Cs. Indeed, a measure of uniformity called star discrepancy was adopted, and the goal was to choose N points with the smallest discrepancy [31], [32]. Hence, the resulting design (uniform design) and has been popularly used during the past more than three decades [33], [34]. Inspired and motivated by Fang et al. (1980, 1995, 2000), Cabaret et al. (2007), Xia et al. (2013), Rodriguez et al. (2014), and Fei et al. (2016), mathematical knowledge and image processing techniques are applied to measure quantitatively for the distribution uniformity of temperature fields. In this work, the main objective is to explore the quantitative characterization of temperature distribution using image analysis.
This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, a novel approach of quantifying temperature uniformity is presented; then, temperature data is described in order to corroborate the validity of the new approach. In Section 3, comparisons among various uniformity measures for temperature field are performed using real data and computer experiments. In Section 4, applications to open literature are presented. Finally, summary of findings and concluding remarks are given in Section 5.
