The calculation of weighted means along with its accompanied reduced chi-squared statistic and visualisation of univariate data density provide important insight into the nature and usability of said data. Many numerical tools have been developed for this purpose, but few are available across multiple operating systems, and are generally restricted to antiquated programming languages. We provide a new cross-platform application called KDX (kay-dee-kai; a combined initialism of kernel density estimation and reduced chi-squared). This application is designed to perform the aforementioned functions in the robust Java platform. In addition to providing the ability to export the visualisations in a variety of file formats, it provides an extensive customization for production of publication-quality figures not requiring additional editing in vector image editing software. This application and source code is available free of charge from the author's websites.
