The problem of bounding the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic sets defined over the real numbers has a long history, and has attracted the attention of many researchers – starting from the first results due to Oleĭnik and Petrovskiĭ [24], followed by Thom [29], Milnor [22]. Aside from their intrinsic mathematical interest from the point of view of real algebraic geometry, these bounds have found applications in diverse areas – most notably in discrete and computational geometry (see for example [5]), as well as in theoretical computer science [33], [23], [7]. Very recently, studying the probability distribution of these numbers for randomly chosen real varieties have also become an important topic of research [16].
In this paper we study the topological complexity of real varieties, as well as semi-algebraic sets, which have symmetry. We will see that the ordinary Betti numbers of symmetric semi-algebraic sets can be (asymptotically) as large as in the general non-symmetric case. So studying the growth of Betti numbers of symmetric semi-algebraic sets is not very interesting on its own. However, for symmetric semi-algebraic sets it is natural to consider their equivariant Betti numbers. The equivariant Betti numbers (with coefficients in a field of characteristic 0) equals in this case the Betti numbers of their orbit spaces – and here some interesting structure emerges. For instance, unlike in the non-equivariant situation the behavior of these equivariant Betti numbers of real and complex varieties drastically differ from each other. Moreover, in both cases the higher dimensional equivariant cohomology groups vanish – and the dimension of vanishing only depends on the degrees of the polynomials defining the variety, and is independent of the dimension of the ambient space. To our knowledge quantitative studies on the topology of symmetric semi-algebraic sets, in particular obtaining tight bounds on their equivariant Betti numbers, have not been undertaken previously. We prove asymptotically tight bounds on the equivariant Betti numbers of symmetric semi-algebraic sets as well as give an application of our results in a non-equivariant setting.
For the remainder of the paper we fix a real closed field R, and we denote by C the algebraic closure of R.
Outline of the paper: The paper is structured as follows. In §1.1 we discuss some history and motivation behind studying the problem of bounding the equivariant Betti numbers of symmetric semi-algebraic sets. In §1.2 we give a brief introduction to and overview of known bounds on the Betti numbers of semi-algebraic subsets in Rk as well as of complex sub-varieties of Ck. In §1.3 we introduce the basic definitions and certain basic results related to equivariant (co)homology. In §1.4 we highlight some fundamental differences in the behavior of the equivariant Betti numbers of real as opposed to complex algebraic varieties. In §2 we state the main results of this paper. We give an outline of the proofs of the results in §2.3.
The rest of the paper is devoted to the proofs of these results. In §3, we recall certain facts from real algebraic geometry and topology that are needed for the proofs of the main theorems. These include definitions of certain real closed extensions of the ground field R consisting of algebraic Puiseux series with coefficients in R. We also recall some basic inequalities amongst the Betti numbers which are consequences of the Mayer–Vietoris exact sequence. In §4, we define certain equivariant deformations of symmetric varieties and prove some topological properties of these deformations, that mirror similar ones in the non-equivariant case. We prove the main theorems in §5.
Finally, we end with some open questions in §6.
1.1. MotivationThere are several different motivations behind studying the equivariant Betti numbers of symmetric semi-algebraic sets. One motivation comes from computational complexity theory. It is a well known phenomenon that the worst case topological complexity of a class of semi-algebraic sets reflects the computational hardness of testing whether a given set in this class is non-empty, as well as computing topological invariants such as the Betti numbers of such sets. For instance, it is an NP-hard problem (in the Blum–Shub–Smale model) to decide if a given real algebraic variety V⊂Rk defined by one polynomial equation of degree at most 4 is empty or not [9]. The Betti numbers of such varieties can be exponentially large in k. In contrast, the same problem of deciding emptiness, as well as computing other topological invariants of real varieties defined by a fixed number of quadrics in Rk can be solved with polynomial complexity [1], [3]. (Note that while a real variety defined by any number of at most quadratic equations can obviously be defined by a single polynomial equation of degree ≤4 by taking a sum of squares, not all quartic polynomials in k variables can be written as a sum of squares of some constant number of quadratic polynomials as k→∞, and thus the last statement does not contradict the previous one.) The Betti numbers of such sets can also be bounded by a polynomial function of k [2], [4]. This close connection between the worst case upper bound on the Betti numbers, and the algorithmic complexity of computing topological invariants, breaks down if one considers the class of “symmetric” real varieties. On one hand the topological complexity in terms of the Betti numbers of such sets can be as big as in the non-symmetric situation (see Example 1). On the other hand, there exist algorithms whose complexity depends polynomially in the number of variables (for fixed degrees) for testing emptiness of such sets [30], [28]. This dichotomy suggests that perhaps the topological complexity of symmetric varieties, and semi-algebraic sets is better reflected by their equivariant Betti numbers rather than the ordinary ones. The results of the current paper (which show that the equivariant Betti numbers of real varieties and semi-algebraic sets are polynomially bounded for fixed degrees) agree with this intuition. We also note that studying the computational complexity of symmetric vs. non-symmetric versions of problems in linear algebra and algebraic geometry is an active field of research – see for example [19] for several results of this kind for computational problems involving high-dimensional tensors.Our second motivation is more concrete and leads to an improvement in certain situations of an important result proved by Gabrielov, Vorobjov and Zell [15] who proved a bound on the ordinary Betti numbers of the image under projection of a semi-algebraic set, in terms of the number and degrees of polynomials defining the original set. The bound is obtained by bounding the dimensions of certain groups occurring as the E1-term of a certain spectral sequence. It turns out that there is an action of the symmetric group on this spectral sequence, and quotienting out this action yields a better approximation to the homology groups of the image than the original spectral sequence. Our bound on the equivariant Betti numbers can now be used to bound the dimension of this quotient object. We explain this consequence of our results in §2.2.Before proceeding further we first fix some notation and recall some classical tight upper bounds on the Betti numbers of general (i.e. not necessarily symmetric) real (respectively complex) varieties, in terms of the degrees of the defining polynomials and the dimension of the ambient space. Obtaining such bounds has been an important area of research in quantitative real (respectively complex) algebraic geometry.
1.2. Topological complexity of complex varieties and real semi-algebraic setsNotation 1For P∈R[X1,…,Xk] (respectively P∈C[X1,…,Xk]) we denote by Zer(P,Rk) (respectively Zer(P,Ck)) the set of zeros of P in Rk (respectively Ck). More generally, for any finite set P⊂R[X1,…,Xk] (respectively P⊂C[X1,…,Xk]), we denote by Zer(P,Rk) (respectively Zer(P,Ck)) the set of common zeros of P in Rk (respectively Ck).Notation 2For any finite family of polynomials P⊂R[X1,…,Xk], we call an element σ∈{0,1,−1}P, a sign condition on P. For any semi-algebraic set Z⊂Rk, and a sign condition σ∈{0,1,−1}P, we denote by Reali(σ,Z) the semi-algebraic set defined by{x∈Z|sign(P(x))=σ(P),P∈P}, and call it the realization of σ on Z. More generally, we call any Boolean formula Φ with atoms, P∼0,P∈P where ∼ is one of =,>, or <, to be a P-formula. We call the realization of Φ, namely the semi-algebraic setReali(Φ,Rk)={x∈Rk|Φ(x)} a P-semi-algebraic set. Finally, we call a Boolean formula without negations, and with atoms P∼0,P∈P where ∼ is one of ≤,≥, to be a P-closed formula, and we call the realization, Reali(Φ,Rk), a P-closed semi-algebraic set.Notation 3For any semi-algebraic set or a complex variety X, and a field of coefficients F, we will denote by Hi(X,F) the i-th cohomology group of X with coefficients in F, by bi(X,F)=dimF⁡Hi(X,F), and by b(X,F)=∑i≥0bi(X,F). Note that defining the cohomology groups of semi-algebraic sets over arbitrary (possibly non-Archimedean) real closed fields requires some care, and we refer the reader to [6, Chapter 6] for details. Roughly speaking, for a closed and bounded semi-algebraic set S, Hi(S,F) is defined as the i-th simplicial cohomology group associated to a semi-algebraic triangulation of S. For a general semi-algebraic set S, Hi(S,F) is defined as the i-th cohomology group of a closed and bounded semi-algebraic replacement of S, which is semi-algebraically homotopy equivalent to it. This definition is clearly invariant under semi-algebraic homotopy equivalences, and coincides with ordinary singular cohomology groups for semi-algebraic sets defined over R.The following classical result, which gives an upper bound on the Betti numbers of a real variety in terms of the degree of the defining polynomial and the number of variables, is due to Oleĭnik and Petrovskiĭ [24], Thom [29] and Milnor [22].Theorem 1[24], [29], [22] Let Q∈R[X1,…,Xk] be a polynomial with deg⁡(Q)≤d. Then, for any field of coefficients F,b(Zer(Q,Rk),F)≤d(2d−1)k−1.By separating the real and imaginary parts of complex polynomials and taking their sums of squares, one obtains as an immediate corollary:Corollary 1Let Q⊂C[X1,…,Xk] be a finite set of polynomials with deg⁡(Q)≤d,Q∈Q. Then, for any field of coefficients F,b(Zer(Q,Ck),F)≤2d(4d−1)2k−1.In the semi-algebraic case, we have the following bounds.Theorem 2[22] Let S⊂Rk be a basic closed semi-algebraic set (i.e. a semi-algebraic set defined by a finite conjunction of weak polynomial inequalities) defined by P1≥0,…,Ps≥0, and the degree of each Pi is bounded by d. Then, for any field of coefficients F,b(S,F)≤sd(2sd−1)k−1.Theorem 3[6], [14] Let P⊂R[X1,…,Xk] be a finite family of polynomials with deg⁡(P)≤d for each P∈P, and card(P)=s. Let S be a P-closed semi-algebraic set. Then, for any field of coefficients F,b(S,F)≤∑i=0k∑j=1k−i(s+1j)6jd(2d−1)k−1. If T is a P-semi-algebraic set then, for any field of coefficients F,b(T,F)≤∑i=0k∑j=1k−i(2s2+1j)6jd(2d−1)k−1.We refer the reader to [5] for a survey of other known results in this direction. Even though the bounds in the case of real varieties often differ in important respects, the upper bounds on the Betti numbers in both the real and complex case share the feature that they depend exponentially in the dimension of the ambient space, and if the dimension of the ambient space is fixed, of being polynomial in the degrees of the defining polynomials.
1.3. Topological complexity of symmetric varietiesAnother area of research with a long history is the action of groups on varieties. Suppose G is a compact group acting on a real or complex variety V. If the action is sufficiently nice then the space of orbits is again a variety in the complex case and a semi-algebraic set in the real case. Studying the topology of such orbit spaces is a very natural and well studied problem. We approach it in this paper from a quantitative point of view, and consider the problem of proving tight upper bounds on the Betti numbers of the orbit space in terms of the degrees of the defining polynomials of V. In this paper we study exclusively the orbit spaces of the symmetric group, Sk, or products of symmetric groups, acting in the standard way on finite dimensional real or complex vector spaces by permuting coordinates. These orbit spaces were described (semi-)algebraically in the fundamental papers of Procesi [25], and Procesi and Schwarz [26]. Subsequently, symmetric group actions in the context of real algebraic geometry and optimization were studied by several authors (see for example [28], [30], [31], [32], [21], [8]). We will see that the behavior in terms of topological complexity of the real and complex orbit spaces differ substantially (unlike in the non-symmetric situation discussed above).Notation 4Let k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0ω, with k=∑i=1ωki. For P∈R[X(1),…,X(ω)] (resp. P∈C[X(1),…,X(ω)]) where each X(i) is a block of ki variables.For d=(d1,…,dω)∈Z≥0ω, we will denote by R[X(1),…,X(ω)]≤d (resp. C[X(1),…,X(ω)]≤d) denote the set of polynomials whose degree in X(i) is bounded by di for 1≤i≤ω.We will denote by R[X(1),…,X(ω)]Sk (resp. C[X(1),…,X(ω)]Sk) the set of polynomials which are fixed under the action of Sk=Sk1×⋯×Skω acting by independently permuting each block of variables X(i).Notation 5Let k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0ω, with k=∑i=1ωki, and let X be a semi-algebraic subset of Rk or a constructible subset of Ck, such that the product of symmetric groups Sk=Sk1×⋯×Skω act on X by independently permuting each block of coordinates. We will denote by X/Sk the orbit space of this action. If ω=1, then k=k1, and we will denote Sk simply by Sk.We recall first the definition of equivariant cohomology groups of a G-space for an arbitrary compact Lie group G. For G any compact Lie group, there exists a universal principal G-space, denoted EG, which is contractible, and on which the group G acts freely on the right. The classifying space BG, is the orbit space of this action, i.e. BG=EG/G.Definition 1(Borel construction) Let X be a space on which the group G acts on the left (henceforth a G-space). Then, G acts diagonally on the space EG×X by g(z,x)=(z⋅g−1,g⋅x). For any field of coefficients F, the G-equivariant cohomology groups of X with coefficients in F, denoted by HG⁎(X,F), is defined by HG⁎(X,F)=H⁎(EG×X/G,F).For any G-space X, there exists a spectral sequence [11, §VII.7 (7.2)] abutting to HG⁎(X,F) whose E2-term is given by(1)E2p,q=Hp(G,Hq(X,F)).The action of G on X induces an action of G on the cohomology ring H⁎(X,F), and we denote the subspace of H⁎(X,F) fixed by this action by H⁎(X,F)G.When card(G) is invertible in an F-module M (so in particular when G is finite and F is of characteristic 0), we have that Hn(G,M)=0, for n>0. This implies that when G is finite and char(F)=0, the spectral sequence (1) degenerates at its E2-term, and moreover,(2)HGn(X,F)≅H0(G,Hn(X,F))≅Hn(X,F)G, where the second isomorphism follows from [11, §III:1 (1.8)].Moreover, if X is a G-space, such that every isotropy group is finite (for example, when G is finite) and char(F)=0, then(3)H⁎(X,F)G≅H⁎(X/G,F) (see, for example, [10, page 4, Remark 2]).Thus, combining (2) and (3) in case G is finite and char(F)=0, we have the isomorphisms(4)H⁎(X/G,F)→∼HG⁎(X,F)→∼H⁎(X,F)G.Notation 6For any Sk symmetric semi-algebraic subset S⊂Rk with k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0ω, with k=∑i=1ωki, and any field F, we denotebSki(S,F)=dimF⁡HSki(S,F)bSk(S,F)=∑i≥0bSki(S,F).Remark 1Let k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0ω, with k=∑i=1ωki, and let V⊂Rk be a real variety symmetric with respect to the action of Sk permuting each block of ki coordinates independently. Suppose that V is defined by a finite set P⊂R[X(1),…,X(ω)] of non-negative polynomials which are not necessarily symmetric with respect to each block X(i). Then, there exists Psymm∈R[X(1),…,X(ω)], such that Psymm is symmetric in each block X(i), deg⁡(Psymm)≤maxP∈P⁡deg⁡(P), and V=Zer(Psymm,Rk). More precisely, for each P∈P, and each σ=(σ1,…,σω)∈Sk, letPσ=P(σ1(X(1)),…,σω(X(ω))), where σi(x(i))=σi(X1(i),…,Xki(i))=(Xσi(1)(i),…,Xσi(ki)(i)) for each i,1≤i≤ω.Then, Pσ is also non-negative over Rk, and deg⁡(Pσ)=deg⁡(P). Now lettingPsymm=∑P∈P,σ∈SkPσ we have that Psymm∈R[X(1),…,X(ω)], V=Zer(Psymm,Rk), Psymm is non-negative over Rk, deg⁡(Psymm)≤maxP∈P⁡deg⁡(P), and moreover Psymm is symmetric in each block of variables X(i).Notice that the corresponding statement is not always true over C. For example, let k=(k), and consider the symmetric variety VC=Zer(P,Ck) defined byP=⋃1≤i≤k{∏j=1d(Xi−j)}, with d≤k.Note that each polynomial in P is of degree d, but not symmetric. Now, b0(VC/Sk,Q)=(Θ(k))d (see Example 1). On the other hand we show (see (12)) that for any symmetric variety VC⊂Ck defined by symmetric polynomials of degree at most d≤k,b0(VC/Sk,Q)≤dO(d). This leads to a contradiction for k≫d. Thus, it is not possible to describe VC by symmetric polynomials in C[X1,…,Xk] of degree d.Now let V=Zer(P,Rk) be a variety that is invariant under the usual action of Sk for some k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0ω, with k=∑i=1ωki. A fundamental result due to Procesi and Schwarz [26] states that the orbit space V/Sk has the structure of a semi-algebraic set which has the following explicit description.Notation 7For each k≥1,i≥0, we will denote by ei(k)(X1,…,Xk) the i-th elementary symmetric polynomial in X1,…,Xk, and denote by ϕk:Rk→Rk (resp., ϕk:Ck→Ck), the map defined by x↦(e1(k)(x),…,ek(k)(x)). Similarly, for k≥1,i≥0, we denotepi(k)(X1,…,Xk)=∑j=1kXji, and denote by ψk:Rk→Rk (resp., ψk:Ck→Ck), the map defined by x↦(p1(k)(x),…,pk(k)(x)).More generally, for k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0ω, with k=∑i=1ωki, we will denote by ϕk:Rk→Rk (respectively ψk:Rk→Rk) the map defined by (x(1),…,x(ω))↦(ϕk1(x(1)),…,ϕkω(x(ω))) (respectively (x(1),…,x(ω))↦(ψk1(x(1)),…,ψkω(x(ω)))). We will also denote by the same symbols, ϕk,ψk, the corresponding maps Ck→Ck in the complex case. This should not cause any confusion.Note that the Newton identities (see for example [6, page 103]) give expressions for each sequence of polynomials (ei(k))1≤i≤k and (pi(k))1≤i≤k in terms of the other. Moreover, for all j≥0, there exists uniquely defined polynomials gj(k)∈Q[Z1,…,Zk] such thatpj(k)(X1,…,Xk)=gj(k)(p1(k),…,pk(k)). In particular,g0(k)(Z1,…,Zk)=k,gj(k)(Z1,…,Zk)=Zj,1≤j≤k.Note that(5)deg⁡(gj(k))≤1 for 0≤j≤k,(6)deg⁡(gj(k))≤j for j>k.Notation 8We denote by Hank(k)(Z1,…,Zk)∈R[Z1,…,Zk]k×k the matrix defined by(7)(Hank(k)(Z1,…,Zk))i,j=(ij)gi+j−2(k)(Z1,…,Zk).Note that the degree of det⁡(Hank(k)) is dominated by the degree of the product of its elements on the main diagonal, and it follows from (7) that,(8)deg⁡(det⁡(Hank(k)))≤2(1+2+⋯+(k−1)) (using (7))≤k(k−1).Notation 9For any real symmetric matrix A∈Rk×k we denote by A⪰0 the property that A is positive semi-definite.Now suppose that k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0,d=(d1,…,dω)∈Z≥0ω, with k=∑i=1ωki, and Q∈L[X(1),…,X(ω)]≤dSk (cf. Notation 4), where L=R or C.Lemma 1With the notation introduced above, there exists a polynomial Q˜∈L[Z(1),…,Z(ω)]≤d, such thatQ(X(1),…,X(ω))=Q˜(p1(k1)(X(1)),…,pd(k1)(X(1)),…,p1(kω)(X(ω)),…,pd(kω)(X(ω))).ProofFirst observe thatL[X(1),…,X(ω)]≤dSk≅L[X(1)]≤d1Sk1⊗⋯⊗L[X(ω)]≤dωSkω, and for each i,1≤i≤ω, using the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials,L[X(i)]Ski=L[p1(ki)(X(i)),…,pki(ki)(X(i))]. The lemma follows immediately.  □Now let Q∈L[X(1),…,X(ω)]≤dSk. Let V=Zer(Q,Lk), and let Sk act on V by permuting each block of coordinates X(i),1≤i≤ω. Since for each k the polynomials p1(k),…,pk(k) separate the Sk orbits in Lk, the image of the map ψk is homeomorphic to the quotient V/Sk, a fact that we record in the following proposition.Proposition 1The quotient space V/Sk is homeomorphic to the image ψk(V).In the case L=R, by the Tarski–Seidenberg principle (see for example [6, Chapter 2]) the image of ψk is a semi-algebraic set. Procesi and Schwarz provided the following description of the image of ψk as a basic closed semi-algebraic set.Theorem 4[26] The image of ψk is a basic closed semi-algebraic set described by(9)ψk(Rk)={(z(1),…,z(ω))∈Rk|Hank(ki)(z(i))⪰0,1≤i≤ω}.Using the same notation as in Proposition 1, let V=Zer(Q,Rk) and S the semi-algebraic set defined by Q≥0. We have the following corollary of Theorem 4.Corollary 2The images ψk(V),ψk(S) are basic closed semi-algebraic sets described byψk(V)=Zer(Q˜,Rk)∩{(z(1),…,z(ω))∈Rk|Hank(ki)(z(i))⪰0,1≤i≤ω},ψk(S)=Reali(Q˜≥0,Rk)∩{(z(1),…,z(ω))∈Rk|Hank(ki)(z(i))⪰0,1≤i≤ω}.
1.4. Comparison between real and complex quotientsIn order to contrast the topological behavior of the quotient space of equivariant real and complex varieties, fix two finite sets of polynomials(10)PR⊂R[X1,…,Xk],PC⊂C[X1,…,Xk], symmetric in X1,…,Xk, and let VR=Zer(PR,Rk) and VC=Zer(PC,Ck). Let deg⁡(P)≤d≤k for each P∈PR∪PC. Let Sk act on VR as well as VC by permuting the coordinates X1,…,Xk.1.4.1. Complex quotientThe quotient space VC/Sk is an algebraic subset of Ck. To see this we first need a well known result whose proof we include for completeness. Lemma 2The maps ϕk,ψk:Ck→Ck are surjective.ProofFirst observe that because of Newton identities it suffices to prove the lemma for the map ϕk. Given, z=(z1,…,zk)∈Ck, consider the polynomial Fz=Tk−z1Tk−1+⋯+(−1)dzd. Since C is algebraically closed there exists k roots, x1,…,xk∈C of Fz. Then, ϕk(x1,…,xk)=z.  □Now it follows from the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, that for each P∈PC, there exists a polynomial P˜∈C[Z1,…,Zd] with deg⁡(P˜)≤d, such that P=P˜(p1(k),…,pd(k)). It then follows from Proposition 1 and Lemma 2 that(11)VC/Sk≅Zer(P˜C,Cd)×Ck−d, where P˜C=⋃P∈PC{P˜}.It now follows from (11) and Corollary 1 that, with the assumptions above, and for any field of coefficients F,(12)b(VC/Sk,F)≤2d(4d−1)2d−1=dO(d).More generally, let k=(k1,…,kω)∈Z>0ω,d=(d1,…,dω)∈Z≥0,d≤k, with k=∑i=1ωki,d=∑i=1ωdi, PC⊂C[X(1),…,X(ω)]≤dSk. Denoting as above VC=Zer(PC,Ck) we have:Theorem 5For any field of coefficients F,b(VC/Sk,F)≤2d(4d−1)2d′−1, where d′=∑i=1ωmin⁡(ki,di).In particular, if di≤ki for each i,1≤i≤ω,b(VC/Sk,F)≤dO(ωd).ProofUsing Lemma 1 we have that for each P∈PC, there exists P˜∈C[Z(1),…,Z(d)]≤d, where for each i,1≤i≤ω, Z(i) is a block of min⁡(ki,di) variables, such thatP(X(1),…,X(ω))=P˜(p1(k1)(X(1)),…,pℓ1(k1)(X(1)),…,p1(kω)(X(ω)),…,pℓω(kω)(X(ω))).The quotient space, VC/Sk, is then isomorphic to Zer(P˜C,Cd′)×Ck−d′, where P˜C=⋃P∈PC{P˜}. Now apply Corollary 1.  □This shows in particular, that in case di≤ki for each i, the Betti numbers of the quotient space VC/Sk can be bounded in terms of d and ω, independent of k.1.4.2. Real quotientIn contrast, the space of orbits of the action of Sk on VR has the structure of a semi-algebraic (rather than an algebraic) set (see Proposition 1 above). It is also not possible to bound b(VR/Sk,F) by a function of ω and d independent of k (similar to the complex case) as shown by the following example.Example 1Let k=(k), andP=∑i=1k(∏j=1d(Xi−j))2. Then P is symmetric of degree 2d. Let VR=Zer({P},Rk). Then VR consists of all points x∈{1,…,d}k, VR/Sk is zero-dimensional, and each orbit is represented by a point y=(y1,…,yk), with 1≤y1≤y2⋯≤yk≤d. Since each yi∈{1,…,d}, the set of orbits is in one-to-one correspondence with the finite set Od,k={(ℓ1,…,ℓd)∈Z≥0|∑i=1dℓi=k}. It is easy to see that card(Od,k)=(d+k−1d−1). Therefore,b0(VR/Sk,Q)=(d+k−1d−1)=(Θ(k))d−1.Example 1 shows that there is a fundamental difference in the topological complexity of the orbit space in the complex and real case. In the complex case the topological complexity of the orbit space, VC/Sk, measured by the sum of the Betti numbers, is bounded by a function of d independent of k (for k≥d). However, in the real case, the topology of the space of orbits, VR/Sk, can grow with k for fixed d. However, it is still possible to bound the Betti numbers of the quotient VR/Sk using the description of VR/Sk given in Theorem 4, and the bound on the Betti numbers of basic closed semi-algebraic sets in Theorem 2.Let Q=∑P∈PRP2 (where PR is as in (10)). Then there exists using the fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials, Q˜∈R[Z1,…,Zd] with deg⁡(Q˜)≤2d, such that Q=Q˜(p1(k),…,pd(k)).Also notice that a symmetric matrix A∈Rk×k is positive semi-definite if and only if all its symmetric minors are non-negative.We can thus describe the set ψk(VR) using Eqn. (9) involving 2k polynomial inequalities whose maximum degree equalsdeg⁡(det⁡(Hank(k)(Z)))≤k(k−1) (using (8)), as well as the inequality −Q˜≥0. Applying Theorem 2 directly (and noting that deg⁡(Q˜)≤2d), we get for any field of coefficients F,b(ψk(VR),F)≤(2k+1)d′(2(2k+1)d′+1)k−1, where d′=max⁡(k(k−1),2d). This yields the bound(13)b(ψk(VR),F)≤(O(2kk2d))k.An alternative method for bounding the Betti numbers of VR/Sk is to use the “descent spectral sequence” argument as in [15] (see also [20]). Using the fact that the map ψk is proper one can construct a spectral sequence which converges to H⁎(ψk(VR),F). Bounding the dimension of the first term of this sequence then yields the inequality that for each n≥0,(14)bn(ψk(VR),F)≤∑p+q=nbq(W(p),F), where W(p)=VR×ψk⋯×ψkVR︸p+1 is the (p+1)-fold fibered product (fibered over the map ψk) described byW(p)={(x0,…,xp)∈VRp+1|ψk(x0)=⋯=ψk(xp)}.Clearly, W(p)⊂R(p+1)k is defined by (p+1) polynomial equations each of degree at most d, and kp polynomial equations each of degree at most k. Using inequality (14) and Theorem 1, we obtain(15)b(ψk(VR),F)≤∑i=0k−1∑j=0ibj(W(i−j),F)≤∑p=0k−1b(W(p),F)≤∑p=0k−1max⁡(2d,k)(2max⁡(2d,k)+1)(p+1)k−1=(k+d)O(k2), which is again exponential in k for any fixed d. It is also possible to obtain a bound of a similar shape as in (15) using a different method. First use effective quantifier elimination to obtain a semi-algebraic description of ψk(VR), and then use Theorem 3.
