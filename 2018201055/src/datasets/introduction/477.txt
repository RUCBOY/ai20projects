Low rank modeling [1] has been used in voice separation [2], removing shadows from face images [3], secure communication [4], system identification [5], [6], and noise level reduction [7]. Also, matrix completion [8] has been used in recommender systems [9], millimeter-wave communication systems [10], and Directional of Arrival (DOA) estimation problem [11], [12], [13]. In [11], a coprime structure has been designed for antenna arrays. The covariance matrix of the corresponding virtual array is a low-rank matrix [12], which is recovered for more accurate DOA estimation. Furthermore, in [13], matrix completion is used for selection of an array with the minimum number of sensors. Moreover, a design for sparse array beamformers is discussed in [14] with thanks to matrix completion approach in order to achieve the maximum signal-to interference plus noise ratio.
A model defined for matrix completion is [15](1)Yij=Mij+Zij∀(i,j)∈Ω where Yij,Mij, and Zij are the entries of Y, M, and Z, respectively showing the measurement, desired low-rank, and noise matrices, all with N×l dimensions. Also, Ω represents the measurement set and, without loss of generality, we assume that N<l. Then, our goal is to estimate M. To do so, the following minimization has been proposed [16],(2)minX⁡‖X‖⁎s.t.‖PΩ(X−Y)‖F≤δ where for the arbitrary matrix A, [PΩ(A)]ij=Aij for (i,j)∈Ω and zero, otherwise [15]. Also, ‖⋅‖F and ‖⋅‖⁎ denote the Frobenius and the nuclear norms, respectively. The parameter δ is a threshold for the noise (see Theorem 1 and Remark 1 for details). In addition to nuclear norm minimization, some other approaches have also been addressed. As such, the Alternating minimization method [8], [19] may be mentioned in which the unknown matrix is factorized into two matrices with the dimensions of N×k and k×l where k is the rank and the factorized matrices are estimated alternatively. The major drawback of this approach is that it may get stuck in local minima. Another approach is the Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) [20] in which a shrinkage operator is used to decrease few largest singular values and makes the rest zero. This is performed based on using the right threshold whose selection is a challenging task.
Here, we apply a weighted matrix completion method to solve a haplotype assembly problem which has received increasing attention in recent years [17], [18], [19]. The weighted least-squares approach has already been used in several image processing applications such as filling unobserved pixels and gradient-vector flow estimation [21]. Furthermore, a weighted nuclear norm problem has been defined based on a weighted sum of singular values for image denoising [22], [23].
Human beings are diploid organisms meaning that each cell contains 22 pairs of somatic chromosomes each of which composed of four types of nucleotides, namely A, T, C, and G. However, only a small portion of each pair of chromosomes; known as DNA variation, are different. Haplotype consists of nucleotides of each chromosome at these variation positions [24]. Thus, for a pair of chromosomes, we will have a pair of haplotypes. The haplotype information can be essentially used for disease prediction as well as personalized medicine [25]. It provides prominent insight for understanding the recombination patterns [26] and unraveling the genotype-phenotype relation in both human [27] and plants [28]. As an example, using such information can help crop-breeding scientists to ensure specific and favorable trait of crops. Furthermore, haplotype of the human leukocyte antigen gene plays an important role in survival after transplantation [29].
In the haplotype assembly problem, the goal is to estimate haplotypes using the input data consisting of numerous DNA sequencing reads generated by a sequencing machine (see Fig. 1). The probability of reading a nucleotide wrongly is given by P=10−Q/10 where Q is the quality score provided by the sequencing machine [30], [31]. Note that each read only observes a portion of the haplotype.Download : Download high-res image (58KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Procedure of preparing the input data for the haplotype assembly problem.
The haplotype assembly problem can be cast as a matrix completion problem [17] in which the nucleotides are modeled by {1,−1} (see Fig. 1). As a simple error-free example, two haplotype vectors may be shown by h1=[1,1,1,1] and h2=[−1,−1,−1,1]. Then, six examples of incomplete reads {y1,...,y6} can be imagined for these haplotypes as y1=[1,1,0,0], y2=[0,1,1,0], y3=[1,0,0,1], y4=[−1,−1,0,0], y5=[0,−1,−1,0], and y6=[−1,0,0,1], where zeros show unobserved entries. These vectors can also be arranged as the rows of an incomplete matrix Y. Then, our task is to estimate the unobserved entries of Y using a matrix completion approach to get an estimate of M, based on which we will be able to estimate haplotype vectors.
In this paper, we first propose a new weighted optimization scheme in which each measurement is utilized. Then, the corresponding error bound is derived in Theorem 1. Accordingly, the weights are optimized using quality of measurements. At last, a new algorithm is developed based on the mentioned optimization to estimate the haplotypes.
The presented model in this paper is capable of general usage in an application that a matrix should be completed along with side information showing the quality of sampled elements. As an example, in millimeter wave communication systems, channel estimation is an essential task that suffers from array impairments as a result of mutual coupling and manufacture flaws [10]. Since, the channel matrix is low rank, a matrix completion method can be used to estimate the channel state information. Here, the known entries are estimated based on the data received during the training process that partially experience the channels. In such a scheme, the entries corresponding to the channel with higher signal to noise ratio are more reliable and should be treated in a different way than the others. This can be implemented using a larger weight in the presented model of this work. Another possible application is movie recommender systems [32], [33] in which lots of people vote for the movies. In this case, the votes of some verified users like critics are more reliable than the others. Hence the mentioned weighted scheme can represent the problem in a more efficient way.
