Recent solid state hydrogen storage research has focused on the use of low density materials, often with large accessible surface area and microporosity [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. During the development of these materials, their applicability to hydrogen storage is typically investigated using commercial gas sorption analysers designed for generic applications. Due to low and poorly known density, many light-element hydrogen storage materials present a number of concerns when attempting to accurately measure their gas storage characteristics [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. These problems apply to both of the main measurement techniques, the Sieverts or manometric technique based on pressure measurements, and the gravimetric technique based on weight measurements [12] and this can have an adverse effect on hydrogen storage research [1], [6] including renewable energy applications [15].
A consequence of this has been a history of inaccurate uptake measurements on carbon materials [10]. From initial reports of 5–10 wt% of hydrogen on carbon nanotubes [16] to 67 wt% on carbon nanofibres [17] and 20 wt% on Li-doped carbon nanotubes [18], results have been published which have subsequently found to be irreproducible or in error [10].
A second aspect of the measurement problem is the increasing demand for pressures above what can be provided from laboratory gas cylinders, typically 150–200 bar when full. This demand is driven by increasing interest in high-pressure storage systems that include an absorbing/adsorbing material to enhance the total hydrogen capacity at the now standard 700 bar storage pressure, implemented in commercially available fuel-cell automobiles such as the Honda Clarity FCV [19], Toyota Mirai [20] and Hyundai ix35 [21]. High hydrogen pressure exacerbates many of the problems associated with measuring low density materials [11]. Hydrogen pressures above that supplied from a cylinder impose the need for a pressure booster, for example a reciprocating mechanical compressor, metal-hydride compressor or static piston pressure booster. The special requirements for hydrogen science, particularly materials compatibility and leak tightness, make this problem non-trivial.
In this paper we describe a Sieverts apparatus for measuring isotherms to above 300 bar with hydrogen pressure intensification achieved with a computer driven piston pressure booster (also known as a syringe pump).
Measurement theoryThe most common methods of measuring an adsorption isotherm are manometric (aka Sieverts or volumetric), where uptake is calculated from measurements of temperature and pressure, and gravimetric, where uptake is calculated from the sample weight corrected for buoyancy. The manometric method is typically favoured due to lower cost, simplicity and portability [9]. The technique entails dosing a known quantity of gas from a well calibrated reference volume into a known cell volume containing the sample. The quantity of gas adsorbed/absorbed by the sample is calculated from the difference between the expected and measured gas pressure of the system. Repeated applications of this pressure step at successively higher (for absorption) or lower (for desorption) pressures builds a map of hydrogen uptake as a function of pressure for a constant temperature. The resultant Pressure-Composition-Temperature (PCT) isotherm can be repeated at different temperatures and used to determine the enthalpy and entropy changes of the reaction [22].Fig. 1 shows a schematic of a simplified Sieverts apparatus consisting of an accurately known reference volume, Vref, and a volume containing the sample, Vcell. With valve S closed, Vref is brought to a desired pressure and, after allowing a period of time for equilibration, the pressure and temperature are recorded and the number of moles of gas in Vref is:(1)n=PrefiVrefZ(Prefi,Trefi)RTrefiwhere Prefi and Trefi are the pressure and temperature initially in the reference volume, R is the ideal gas constant and Z(Prefi,Trefi) is the compressibility of the gas as a function of pressure and temperature. This known quantity of gas is then allowed to react with the sample by opening the valve S. After allowing time for the pressure and temperature to equilibrate, valve S is closed and the pressure and temperatures of the system are recorded. The amount of gas sorbed by the sample is given by the molar balance equation [23],(2)ΔnH2k=[PrefiZ(Prefi,Trefi)RTrefi−PsysfZ(Psysf,Tsysf)RTreff]Vref−[PsysfZ(Psysf,Tcellf)RTcellf−(PsysfZ(Psysf,Tcellf)RTcellf)(k−1)]×[Vcell−mX(nH2k)ρX(nH2k)]where mX(nH2k) and ρX(nH2k) are the sorption dependent mass and density of the sample respectively, the superscripts, i and f, refer to states before valve S is opened and after S is closed, while (k–1) refers to gas that is already in Vcell from the previous isotherm step. This step process is then repeated and the total amount of hydrogen in the sample after N steps is(3)nH2N=∑k=1NΔnH2kDownload : Download high-res image (87KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Measurement errors and uncertaintiesThe Sieverts technique has the inherent problem that any errors or uncertainties in a single pressure step accumulate as each step is added [11]. Measurements of pressure and temperature are made in each step and it is therefore necessary to ensure that the pressure and temperature sensors are sufficiently accurate for the types of measurement undertaken. For small samples with low sorption capacity this generally means the highest accuracy possible. From Eq. (2), it can be seen that the values of the reference and cell volumes are also critical in each step and this requires accurate volume calibration. Webb and Gray [24] developed equations for the uncertainties in hydrogen uptake by the Sieverts method and studied the effect of different volumes for the cell and reference volumes. Best performance was found when the reference and cell volumes are nearly equal and as small as possible.The accuracy of the Sieverts technique also relies on how well the dead or void volume can be determined [11], [13], [23]. This is the volume in the cell accessible to gas, ie the volume of the cell not occupied by the sample, and requires knowledge of the sample volume or density (as the sample mass is usually simple to determine). Sometimes the sample density is not known or not known accurately and may even change during sorption depending on the amount of gas sorbed.For crystalline materials, the density of the sample may be estimated from its crystal structure (“X-ray density”), at least before hydrogen sorption takes place. Low density materials of interest, especially carbons [25], [26], [27] and polymers [28] may be amorphous, making estimation of the density of a sample from its mass problematic. Expansion or swelling of samples in the presence of hydrogen raises a further difficulty, since the volume of the sample is not constant during the measurement. The initial sample volume may be found by measuring the dead volume of the sample cell with an inert gas, typically He. However, it has been reported that He can adsorb onto single-walled carbon nanotubes [29] and zeolites and activated carbons [30] at temperatures as high as 573 K. While heating the sample in excess of 573 K may seem like a straight forward solution, many materials such as metal-doped activated carbons [31], [32] and reduced graphene-oxide [33] can change structurally and chemically at temperatures above 473 K.Blach and Gray [9] demonstrated the sensitivity of the Sieverts method to poor knowledge of the sample density by varying the assumed density of a potassium intercalated graphite sample in the uptake calculations. A variation of 25% in a small cell incurred a change of ∼100% in the apparently adsorbed hydrogen, compared to only ∼0.1% change for a larger cell. This was confirmed in the uncertainty study [11], which showed that, provided overall volumes are kept as small as possible and the reference and cell volumes are similar, a cell volume which is large compared to the sample volume mitigates the effect of the density uncertainty on the total uptake.As Sieverts measurements rely on changes of pressure in the system due to sorption of H2 by a sample, it is necessary to have sufficient absorption in each step to produce a pressure change that can be measured. The pressure change depends on the amount of gas sorbed by the sample as well as the size of the volumes involved, and whether this change is resolvable depends on the accuracy of the pressure transducer. Blach and Gray [9] devised a figure of merit to determine if accurate measurements can be made with a given instrument on a particular sample. Relating the time evolution of the system pressure change due to sorption, to the accuracy of the pressure transducer, the authors proposed the figure of merit:(4)η=skδpwhere δp is the useable resolution of the transducer obtained from the full-scale accuracy and sk is the slope of the isochore due to sorption by the sample directly after valve Vs is opened. For the simple system shown in Fig. 1, this is:(5)sk=nXR2(VrefZ(Psysk,Trefk)Trefk+VcellZ(Psysk,Tcellk)Tcellk)Where nX is the number of moles of sample. While this figure of merit is typically used to determine if a given sample can be accurately measured by the instrument at hand, it can also guide the design of an instrument. Eq. (5) shows that, for the same pressure and temperature, smaller volumes increase the figure of merit. The authors suggested that, as a rule of thumb, η ≥ 100, is required for high quality data.
