Compared with traditional electronic counterpart, optical computer has many advantages brought by the physical properties of light. These advantages include high speed [1], high parallelism [2], [3], multi-values and low-energy consumption and so on. To take use of these advantages, more and more researchers have set their focuses on optical computers. However, most of them follow the ideas that the electronic counterpart has experienced. And many of them are limited to theories, simulations of optical computing or optical components. For example, Zaghloul presented a complete all-optical-processing polarizer-based binary-logic system with which logic gate and processor can be implemented [4], [5], [6]. Ghosh et al. put forward trinary flip-flops and trinary arithmetic and logic unit (TALU) using savart plate and spatial light modulator in multivalued logic [7]. Chattopadhyay et al. found Galois Field (GF) algebraic expressions for multivalued logic, developed GF (4) adder multi-valued logic circuits in all optical domain in 2009 [8]. And they used non-linear material-based interferometirc switches to design a converter which can transform 3-bit binary number to equivalent single-digit QSD (quaternary-signed digit) [9]. Esmaeili et al. presented a systematic method to design arithmetic unit using efficient Photonic crystal (PhC) NOT gate [10].
Different from the traditional research mentioned above, Jin et al. proposed the concept of ternary optical computer (TOC) which applies two Orthogonal polarizations of light and dark state to express information [11]. Based on the theory of TOC, a thousand-data-bits experimental system was successfully constructed. And many interesting research results have beeen obtained [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. According to the progress of the study on TOC, it has been a computation experimental system which is efficient in logical operation. However it is very inefficient in numerical calculation because of lacking of effectively adder. To promote it to the application field in numerical calculation, a lot of research attempts have been done and much progress has been obtained [12], [16], [17], [18]. One of the most impressive studies is a SMSD number based adder solution which was proposed by Song et al. [18]. In the study, they found the advantages of a new number system, SMSD number system is very suitable for the three-valued binary computer system TOC. Using SMSD number, they designed an optical adder which can implement addition operation in one-step without carry delay. This is an interesting result. It might highly improve the efficiency of addition and potentially be used in TOC. Though SMSD number consists of three symbols that MSD number system includes or SMSD number can be obtained from common MSD number. Their study fails to discuss how to obtain SMSD number from common MSD number. It could not use the advantages if SMSD number cannot be efficiently obtained.
To solve this issue, a SMSD number conversion method is put forward. Meanwhile, the optical path of the converter together with its converting modules for SMSD number are designed. Analysis and simulation results show that the SMSD number conversion method is correct and the optical path of the converter is effective.
