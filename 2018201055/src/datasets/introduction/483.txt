It is well established that the pairing correlation is an essential ingredient in describing the ground-state properties of finite atomic nuclei, and the solving of the pairing Hamiltonian is important for describing not only nuclei but also other many-body systems [1] including neutron stars [2], superconductors [3], and trapped two-component Fermi gases [4]. The nuclear pairing theory based on the Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer (BCS) approximation [5] was considered for the first time 60 years ago [6]. But the BCS condensate with indefinite particle numbers is problematic in weak pairing finite systems, and the pairing condensate around shell closures will collapse. To overcome those drawbacks, there have been extensive efforts in developing particle-number-conserved approximations (see, Ref. [7] and references therein) and exact pairing models which include the diagonalization [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13] and the Richardson (or the Richardson–Gaudin) method [14], [15], [16]. In 1966, Richardson [17] studied the exact and the BCS solutions of the standard pairing Hamiltonian with Ω=8∼32 at half-fillings, and concluded that the BCS model strongly underestimates the pairing correlations even for relatively large pairing strength.
The Richardson algebraic approach can be applied for large systems but is limited to the standard pairing Hamiltonians with constant pairing force. Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that can handle the general pairing Hamiltonians. The most straightforward method for the numerically exact solution is to diagonalize the Hamiltonian in configuration spaces of fixed seniority [9], [12]. In diagonalization, the number of particles and orbits that can be included is usually limited due to the rapid growth of the dimension. In our previous calculations with exact diagonalization [10], [11], the dimension of the problem is limited to 106 on standard desktops. The limitation is related to the inefficient generation and storage of the basis vectors and the high time complexity of the matrix operations. The limited capacity of the diagonalization makes it challenging to perform realistic calculations and to compare the results with those of BCS or other approximate approaches.
In this study, we developed an efficient diagonalization program, PairDiag, for solving the general pairing Hamiltonian in the doubly-degenerate deformed system. We have applied in the code a novel basis generation algorithm, dynamic evaluation of the non-zero Hamiltonian matrix elements, and the Lanczos [18] algorithm for diagonalization. The system with odd-number of particles can also be treated within the blocking approximation. The program is optimized using OpenMP parallelization and packaged in a fortran module which allows it to be easily combined with existing nuclear structure programs (e.g., self-consistent mean field codes EV8 [19] and Sky3D [20]) as an alternate to the problematic BCS solver. The vector generation and search algorithms in the program can also be transplanted to other programs including the large-scale shell model code.
