In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the use of fractal analysis techniques. The fractal concept studies the degree of symmetry or self-similarity found in a structure at all scales. Mainly, the use of fractals allows the identification of recurring patterns, removing the possibility of image compression (Mandelbrot, 1982, Sun et al., 2014). Mainly, this technique has been applied to characterize the microstructure of different types of food, as fruits and vegetables (Cardenas-Pérez et al., 2016, Quevedo et al., 2016), fish (Manera et al., 2016, Perisho et al., 2016), meat (Quevedo et al., 2013, Zapotoczny et al., 2016), or yoghurt (Celigueta-Torres, Amigo-Rubio, & Ipsen, 2012). To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have applied fractals to predict quality characteristics of food. Tsuta, Sugiyama, and Sagara (2002) used them to predict the sugar content of melons and Polder, Van Der Heijden, Van Der Hoet, and Young (2004) measured the chlorophyll of tomato by applying of fractals. All these studies have used the classical fractal algorithm (CFA). However, the use of fractal analysis has not been carried out to predict quality parameters on pork.
Usual methods for evaluation of the physico-chemical traits of meat products are tedious, time and solvent consuming, and sometimes involve the destruction of the pieces. In this sense, the use of Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as non-destructive, non-ionizing and innocuous technique, has been proposed as an alternative to the classical methods. There are different acquisition sequences of MRI, such as Spin Echo (SE), Gradient Echo (GE) and Turbo 3D (T3D) (Caballero et al., 2017, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2015), and they can be weighted with different spin lattice relaxation time, T1 and T2 (Fantazzini et al., 2005). In the science literature, the most widely used combination is SE as acquisition sequence and T1 as relaxation time. And for analysing the obtained images, all these studies have applied classical texture algorithm, achieving important issues. For example, monitoring the ripening process of Iberian (Antequera, Caro, Rodríguez, & Pérez, 2007), (Fantazzini, Gombia, Schembri, Simoncini, & Virgili, 2009) and San Daniele (Manzoco et al., 2013) hams, estimation of some quality characteristics of hams (Caro et al., 2001, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2010) or differentiating Iberian as a function of pigs diet (Pérez-Palacios et al., 2011). In loins, an adequate product classification as a function of pig breeding and the prediction of some sensory and physico-chemical traits have also been attained by analysing MRI with texture algorithms (Antequera et al., 2003, Caballero et al., 2017, Cernadas et al., 2005, Cernadas et al., 2001); Pérez-Palacios et al., 2015, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2017). Recently, two fractal algorithms (Fractal Texture Algorithm, FTA. and One Point of Fractal curve Texture Algorithm, OPFTA) have been developed for MRI analysis (Caballero et al., 2016, Pérez-Palacios et al., 2017), but their application has not been described.
Most of these studies on MRI used common statistical tools, such as Pearson's correlation coefficients or principal components analysis, to process data and finally determine quality parameters (Antequera et al., 2007, Fantazzini et al., 2009, Manzoco et al., 2013). Recently, Pérez-Palacios, Caballero, Caro, Rodríguez, and Antequera (2014); Pérez-Palacios, Caballero, Antequera, et al., (2017) and Caballero, Caro, Antequera & Pérez-Palacios (2016); Caballero, Caro, Rodriguez et al., (2016); Caballero et al. (2017) have tested some data mining techniques to predict quality characteristics in Iberian hams using MRI and computer vision techniques. Alamprese, Amigo, Engelsen, and Casiraghi (2016) have also used data mining to identify turkey meat adulteration in fresh, frozen and cooked product, and Cortez, Portelinha, Rodrigues, Cadavez, and Teixeira (2006) applied data mining to predict quality traits in lamb meat. Data mining is one of the steps of a larger process known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) (Fayyad, Piatetsky-Shapiro, & Smyth, 1996). One of its main advantages is the increasing ease in data collection over networks (Mitchell, 1999).
This work firstly investigates the use of the combination of MRI, fractals algorithm and data mining techniques to determine pork quality parameters non-destructively. The main objective is to evaluate the capability of different fractal algorithms (CFA, FTA and OPFTA) to analyse MRI in order to predict quality parameters of loin. In addition, the effect of the sequence acquisition (SE, GE and T3D) of MRI and the predictive technique of data mining (Multiple Linear Regression, MLRI, and Isotonic Regression, IR) were analysed.
