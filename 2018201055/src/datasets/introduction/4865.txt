The studies of complex networks are a hot topic  [1], [2], [3] and have been applied successfully in many fields such as communications, bioinformatics, transportation  [4] and so on. Community structures as one feature of complex networks widely exist in plenty of real-world networks  [3], [5]. A community often can be seen as a dense subgraph, since nodes of same communities are densely connected than that of different communities  [1], [2], [3], [5]. Community detection plays an important role in understanding the characteristics of complex networks, since each community structure often corresponds to a functional unit, which can help us understand complex network-based systems  [1], [2], [3], [5]. Therefore, many researchers from different fields pay more attention to community detection  [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34].
Fortunato  [5] reviewed community detection methods proposed in recent years. His work mentioned that objective optimization  [35], [36], [37] is an effective approach and plays an important role in community detection. For example, Newman and Girvan  [6], [7], [8] proposed a new metric, modularity, and they defined it as the fraction of links within a community in the actual network, minus its expected fraction of links in a random network. They showed that the best partition of a network is the one with the maximum of the modularity   [6], [7], [8]. Rosvall and Bergstrom  [10] used the full description length of a partition of a network to compress the network based on the rationale of a communication process. An optimal partition of a network is the one with the minimum description length  [10]. Although objective optimization approaches work beautifully and play an important role in community detection, Fortunato and Barthélemy  [11] found that the modularity optimization method suffered from a resolution limit problem. In other words, some specific cases of graphs cannot be correctly classified by the method, since the modularity optimization method overemphasizes the number of whole links of a network  [11]. Rosvall and Bergstrom  [10] also claimed that this problem is mainly because the definition of modularity neglects the size of a community. Therefore, this problem attracted more attention of scholars over past few years, e.g. Arenas et al.  [12] studied a variant of the modularity to alleviate the resolution limit problem. Li and Zhang  [13] considered the community size in a new measure, modularity density (or D) to solve the resolution limit problem. However, Zhang et al.  [14] pointed out that the modularity density also exposed to a serious resolution problem, i.e. some uncovered communities even deviate from the weak definition of community  [14]. Recently, a new problem, imbalance problem in community detection was revealed  [15], which is due to the asymmetry of the measures that tends to overemphasize either the interior or the exterior of a community.
In contrast to the global community detection above, local community detection tries to find the community that contains a set of specific nodes. Bagrow  [16] developed a new benchmark, which is capable of testing properties specific to local community-finding methods. Coscia et al.  [17] proposed a general meta definition for a community and reviewed the community detection methods based on the variants of the definition. This work provided us with a new way to understand community structure and its detecting methods  [17]. For local community-finding methods, since the detected local community tends to contain some irrelevant subgraphs, Wu et al.  [18] systematically studied the problem and developed a new method to alleviate it. The results on both the real and the synthetic networks show the method’s effectiveness and efficiency. In addition, Papadopoulos et al.  [19] extended the application of community detection to the field of Social Media and provided a detailed discussion of community detection in this context.
How to measure the interior and the exterior of a community impartially is of great importance for community detection. This paper develops a new framework, which tries to measure the interior and the exterior of a community based on a same metric, complete graph model. We partition a network into subnetworks by maximizing the difference between the interior and the exterior of the subnetworks. In addition, we compare our approach with some state of the art methods on computer-generated networks based on the LFR benchmark as well as real-world networks.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section  2, we discuss the problems for community detection. In Section  3, we introduce our framework for community detection. Section  4 presents the experimental results on computer-generated networks as well as real-world networks. The conclusion is provided in Section  5.
