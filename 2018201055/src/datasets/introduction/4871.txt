Computer-aided design and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAD/CAM) are frequently applied in the fields of oral and maxillofacial surgery. After resection of malignant tumors, mandibular reconstruction using a free fibular flap and a CAD/CAM-generated cutting guide is considered to be more accurate than conventional reconstruction.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 Moreover, this technique is expected to contribute to shorter surgical times and overall cost savings.7
As CAD/CAM-generated surgical guides are not yet commercially available in our country because of import regulations, we have been using our own surgical guides, aiming for more accurate reconstruction. However, we noticed that in some cases, especially those in which the transferred fibular bone needs to be split into several segments, deviation errors after reconstruction are not minimized as much as expected. Of course, these deviations are smaller than those with conventional methods; however, the smaller the deviation, the better the result will be. Therefore, we designed a new fixation guide, aiming to make the split bone placements as accurate as planned in real-time surgery. The purpose of this study was to judge whether this new fixation guide would contribute more accuracy to the placement of autologous bone grafts than surgery performed without using fixation guides.
