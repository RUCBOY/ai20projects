MR imaging using periodically rotated overlapping parallel lines with enhanced reconstruction (Propeller, or Blade) has shown superior performance in motion insensitivity from its self-navigated nature [1], [2], [3]. The ability to acquire high-resolution diffusion-weighted images [4], [5], [6] relatively free from geometric distortions [7], [8] is a particularly attractive advantage. Therefore, Propeller MR imaging finds applications in areas prone to susceptibility-induced field inhomogeneities and involuntary motion influences such as the neck [9], [10], the abdomen [2], [11], and the heart [12], [13]. Due to increasing employment in radiological practice, a thorough understanding of its unique image appearance would be helpful for the clinical personnel to ensure proper usage [14], [15].
The k-space sampling pattern of Propeller imaging consists of several blades, each rotated at a fixed angle to another to cover the k-space [1]. Spatial encoding within each blade using regular frequency and phase encoding results in oblique rectangular field-of-view (FOV) at the corresponding angle of the k-space blade. As a result, tissues extending beyond the FOV lead to aliasing artifacts spread along different directions in the entire surrounding regions [15]. In fact, the FOV covered by all single-blade data in a Propeller scan can be regarded as being approximately circular (or more generally, elliptical) [16], even though conventionally the prescription of the FOV for the subsequent Propeller acquisition usually shows a rectangular shape on the operating console of commercial MR systems. Hence, for any object falling outside of the circular FOV but within the rectangular prescribed region, the inconsistent locations and the extents of the aliased object result in subtle signal interferences near the image corners as observed in clinical examinations (Fig. 1), which may cause confusion in image interpretation.Download : Download high-res image (126KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. A coronal breath-hold Propeller image of the chest at a prescribed square FOV of 36 cm (a) shows anomalous signal behaviors at the four image corners, with boundaries consistent with the rotating FOV in Propeller imaging (b), whereas the same slice acquired with 48 cm FOV to avoid aliasing (c; zoomed to the same magnification) shows normal signal behavior. The ECG-gated Propeller scan used spoiled gradient-echo readout (TR/TE = 6.7/3.2, flip angle = 25°) with eight 256 × 52 blades to cover the k-space at a rotation angle of 22.5 degrees.
In this work, we propose a simple de-aliasing method, with the concept inspired by the kt-Blast approach [17], to restore the aliasing-induced signal anomaly in Propeller imaging and hence to retain the information within the rectangular FOV. No extra data acquisition is needed, thus the method could be used as an adjunct to the Propeller imaging package suitable for use in routine MR examinations.
