Currently, cloud computing is developing into a flexible, collaborative, cost effective and scalable computational approach that is quickly being adopted by both public and private organizations. The use of cloud-based applications is substantially increasing among higher education organizations. One of the recent cloud computing tracking poll [1] has reported that 43% of organizations in higher education have implemented or maintained cloud computing in 2012. This number represents a 10% increase from the 2011 poll data and is expected to continue to rise in the coming years.
The process of learning is one of the most basic human characteristics that tends to easily adopt and utilize technology. In recent years, the new techniques and technological tools have continuously been implemented in educational systems. The use of cloud computing is increasingly becoming popular in the educational environments as it provides low-cost services to students and university staff [2]. However, it is necessary to consider the individual characteristics of the users and their perceptions about using the cloud computing technology in order to maximize the benefits of its usage.
This study investigates the relationship between some of the individual factors such as information technology self-efficacy, computer anxiety, perceived ease of use, and the users’ perception of the usefulness and effectiveness of cloud-based applications that are known to impact technology adoption. Also, different cloud computing tools that are utilized by the participants are evaluated from the perspective of their effectiveness in support of their learning experience. Additionally, this preliminary study sought to identify the most popular cloud applications in use among the undergraduate students surveyed, and to give insight into the students’ reasons for the use of these cloud-based applications.
