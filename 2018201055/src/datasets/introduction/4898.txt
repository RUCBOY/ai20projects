The complexity of image reconstruction has acquired much concentration in the medical imaging literature. This is due to the continuous search for developments of imaging modalities, varying from X-ray computerized tomography and emission tomography up to acoustic and optical techniques. They all bring different approaches in the human body either morphological or functional. The classic mathematical model of X-ray computerized tomography (CT) assumes that the sensing device evaluates the line integrals of the object attenuation coefficient at some known orientations [1]. As a typical inverse problem, tomography image reconstruction is usually considered as an ill-posed problem [2]. The tomography image reconstruction of an image is formed of deciding an image object f (x, y) from a collection of projections [3]pθ(r) given by Eq. (1).(1)pθ(r)=∫−∞∞∫−∞∞f(x,y)δ(r−xcosθ−ysinθ)dxdy.Where r is taken on the x–y plane such that r =xcosθ−ysinθ. The discrete inverse radon transform is carried out with the Filtered Back Projection (FBP) algorithm. FBP is established on the basis of Fourier slice theorem [4] , Fast Fourier summation algorithm for image reconstruction [5]. The excellence of reconstruction from entire projections with FBP is widely acceptable, based on the number of angles and sampling points.
The projectionspθ(r), accumulated along a group of static field-gradient orientations in polar grid, are utilized to acquire the sample spin density f (x, y) by Eq. (2) FBP,(2)f(x,y)∫0πpθ*(r)dθ=∫0π[∫−∞∞Pθ(k)|k|e−2πikrdk]dθ,
Here pθ*(r) is the projection Pθ(k) filtered by the expression inside the square brackets.
The important reconstruction methods such as FBP [6] is convincingly effective and fast, but their quality is low when the projection data are noisy [7], [8] and limited [1], [9]. An Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) [10], [11], [12], Simultaneous ART (SART) [13], Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique (SIRT) [14] are shows better resolution for medical imaging in real time [9]. However, these techniques are suffered with enormous computational complexity [15], that is corresponding to the square of the image size multiplied by the number of projections [10]. In the framework of soft computing strategies to image reconstruction from projections, artificial neural networks have been utilized as a very popular and important tool [16]. In an earlier study recurrent neural network algorithm has been utilized for image reconstruction [17], fast tomography reconstruction from limited data has been reported using ANN [14] and the reconstruction technique using BP-ANN has been implemented on a sequential computer [9], which require ANN very long training time.
BP-ANN uses the gradient based approach which either trains slowly or get struck with local minimum. Instead of using gradient-based learning techniques, one may apply the commonly used optimization methods such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to optimize the network initial weights. The PSO algorithm with artificial neural network (PSO-ANN) has offered fine answers to many problems in biomedical science. PSO is to regulate the weight of a BP-ANN has a better performance than random search. The particle swarm optimization algorithm is shows to converge global optimum. So in this paper, a hybrid algorithm combining particle swarm optimization (PSO) with back-propagation (BP) algorithm is utilized. PSO has been used with BP-ANN for optimizing the various parameters such as number of hidden nodes, hidden layer sizes, feature subsets, learning rate, momentum, and optimize the network connection weights. This paper presents the application of hybrid model that integrates PSO and BP-ANN (PSO-ANN) for reconstruction of shepp-logan head phantom image by optimizing the connection weights, which require PSO-ANN very long training time.
The parallel approach to ANN has been explored in a variety of manner, specifically, training session parallelism, exemplar parallelism, node parallelism, and weight parallelism [18]. Parallel approach of BP-ANN has been exposed to be an efficient resolution to all cases of long training times in sequential ANN training on a cluster computer [19], [20], [21], [22]. The training datasets are decomposed into a number of subsets and the subsets are allocated to different computing nodes for parallel processing [23] on a cluster computer [24]. As an extension of the recent work carried out on a sequential computer [9], the present work deals with parallel approach of PSO-ANN decomposition principle. The next section describes standard dataset for the sequential and parallel PSO-ANN. The Section 3 deals with the methodology of the parallel approach of the PSO-ANN. The Section 4 explains the design and implementation details. The results are discussed in Section 5 and concluded in Section 6.
