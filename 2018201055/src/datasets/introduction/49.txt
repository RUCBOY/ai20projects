In the last several decades, the filled skutterudite compounds have influenced experimental and theoretical researchers by their fascinating behavior in electron ground states in material science [1,2]. The materials have potential applications in the case of vital thermoelectric properties [3,4]. The filled skutterudite compounds have further shown attractive phenomena in the field of superconductivity and magnetism [5]. In some cases, these materials have shown their rich phenomena like intermediate valence and non-Fermi liquid [5]. Furthermore, these materials have been found in some semiconducting fields that have small energy gaps between the valence and conduction bands [5]. The structure type of the filled skutterudites compounds is AT4X12 (where, A = alkaline earth or rare earth or actinide materials; T = Fe, Ru, or Os atoms; and X = P, As, Sb or Ge atoms) and shown cubic body-centered crystal [6,7]. Jeitschko et al. [6] synthesis the material LaFe4P12 and investigated its structural parameters in 1977. Sekine et al. [8] studied the skutterudite structure materials PrRu4P12 and PrOs4P12 by measurements of electrical resistivity and magnetic susceptibility and discussed the Metal-insulator transition. Bauer et al. [9] synthesis EuT4Sb12 (T = Fe, Ru, Os) by experimental phenomena like as x-ray diffraction, electrical resistivity, x-ray absorption spectroscopy, etc and studied the different physical properties in 2004. Takabatake et al. investigate the crucial magnetic properties and thermoelectric properties of filled skutterudites compounds AT4Sb12 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, La; T = Fe, Ru, Os) across experimental characterization in 2006 [10]. Bauer et al. predicted the superconductivity at 5.10 K and 5.35 K in SrPt4Ge12 and BaPt4Ge12 and analyzed some experimental and theoretical properties in 2007 [7]. In 2008 Takeda et al. experimented with filled skutterudite CeRu4As12 by X-ray diffraction patterns at ambient pressure and high pressures [11]. Li et al. investigated the materials La(Pt1-xAux)4Ge12 and discussed its crystal system and superconducting parameters in 2009 [12]. Takeda et al. further synthesis the material BaRu4As12 at high pressure in 2010 and investigated its structural and electrical properties [13]. Hayashi et al. studied BaRu4As12 by the X-ray diffraction method at high pressures in 2010 [14]. In the same year 2010 Hayashi et al. further did work about the superconducting skutterudites YT4P12 (T = Fe, Ru and Os) [15]. Takeda et al., in 2014 again experimental studied New Filled Skutterudite GdFe4As12 by X-ray diffraction at ambient and high pressures [16]. A. Shankar et al. investigated the optical response and the electronic band structure of CeRu4As12 by using local density approximation (LDA) and suggest the semiconducting nature with narrow band gap (0.18 eV), brittle in nature, and opaque material with superluminal behavior in the ultraviolet frequency [17]. First principle calculations based on GGA-PBE have been performed for ground-state properties calculation of EuRu4P12 by A. Shankar et al. and investigated its spin base band structures that show the ferromagnetic nature causing its f-band splitting with effective magnetic moment 5.98 [18]. Further, the optical properties calculation exhibits low absorption that indicated the high transparency and appreciable reflectivity in the conduction region [18]. The effect of temperature reduces the bulk modulus and Debye temperature denotes the thermal softening nature of rare earth-filled skutterudites (PrFe4P12) lattice [19]. Different energy band gaps observed from different symmetry points in band structure indicate the semiconducting nature of UFe4P12 and investigated its various thermodynamic properties by using the quasi-harmonic Debye model [20]. In 2018, Bhat et al. published a theoretical work of mechanical, thermodynamic, and thermoelectric properties of SrFe4As12 system [21] and suggest the importance to use in thermoelectric application due to its high-power factor and figure of merit. The optical properties of NdB4As12 (BFe, Ru, Os) indicates the high reflectivity and low absorption near the Fermi level and metal-insulator-metal transition between 0 and 5 eV energy spectra range [22]. The elastic properties of EuRu4As12 suggest a brittle nature with large volume deformation, elastically anisotropic, and covalent character [23]. Further, Ruthenium based material BaRu4As12 shows the covalent nature of inter-atomic bonding and, the band structure and density of states reflect the semi-metallic nature [24].
The above experimental and theoretical work of Ruthenium (Ru) based filled skutterudite compounds and the fascinating behavior in optical properties like as low absorption and high reflectivity in visible energy region, electronic properties such as the covalent character of inter-atomic bonding and the semi-metallic nature, thermodynamic properties like as thermal softening nature, as well as elastic properties have influenced us to study the physical properties about these materials. Therefore, we have chosen SrRu4As12 in the present study and investigated its physical properties for the first time. The filled skutterudite compound SrRu4As12 has synthesis by Nishine et al., in 2017 at high pressure, investigated its structural parameters, and studied some experimental properties [25]. Further, the present work has been investigated by using density functional theory (DFT) with the CASTEP code.
