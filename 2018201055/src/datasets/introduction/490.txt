Electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart and is a standard test in many environments (e.g. operating rooms and ambulances) for the detection of heart problems. In recent years, wearable ECG monitoring devices, which are capable of continuous recording for up to one week [1], have been widely used for daily healthcare applications [2], [3], and the long-term ECG recordings play an important role in the early diagnosis and prevention of heart diseases [4], [5]. Compared with the resting ECG, however, the ECG signals acquired by mobile devices are corrupted by various noises in daily activities, which often lead to unreliable or incorrect diagnosis results.
There are many sources of noises from both inner and outer environments, such as respiration, muscle contraction, physical movements, changes of electrical contact position, etc [6], [7], [8]. These sources are often related to each other, thus corresponding noises are often mixed. Considering physiological and technical factors jointly, this study classifies all noises affecting ECG signals into the following three categories without losing the representativeness of various noises. (1) Baseline wander (BW). The BW noise is mainly caused by respiration and is with gentle slopes (Fig. 1(c)). The frequency of the BW noise is basically less than 0.5 Hz [9]. (2) Motion artifact (EM). The EM noise is caused by the electrode motion, i.e., significant relative movement between the electrode and the skin. Almost all non-resting activities, such as walking and running, can produce the EM noise, which is dominant in daily ECG monitoring [10]. As shown in Fig. 1(a) and (b), the EM noise has varying frequency and amplitude, which largely overlap with that of clean ECG signals. Especially, the transient change of electrical impedance caused by electrode movement can produce a QRS-like artifact, which is often wrongly identified by even QRS detectors [11]. (3) High-frequency (HF) noise. Typical HF noises include muscle artifact and power line interference, and they usually have a frequency larger than 20 Hz (Fig. 1(d)). Specifically, the muscle contraction produces high-frequency low-amplitude random noise, and the frequency of power line interference reaches 50 Hz or above [12].
Many noise removal methods for ECG signals have been proposed in recent decades [7], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], which have been widely employed for various applications such as fetal monitoring [25] and computer-aided diagnosis of ECG [26], [27]. They mainly include the following categories: (1) Digital filtering [13], [14], e.g. the finite impulse response (FIR) filter [15] and the infinite impulse response filter [16]. Digital filters are widely used to remove the noise of a certain frequency range because of the simplicity and efficiency, but they cannot deal with the case of frequency overlapping. (2) Morphological filtering [17], [18]. Morphological operators (e.g. opening and closing) are often used to smooth the ECG signal, where noise with corresponding shape and size to the structuring element can be removed effectively, though it is hard to determine the size and the shape. (3) Wavelet-based denoising [19], [20]. Wavelet transform has been the most effective tool for ECG denoising because it can decompose the signal into components containing both time and frequency information at different scales. Wavelet-based denoising is implemented by applying thresholding to components related to noises. However, some kinds of noises (e.g. motion artifact) do not have obvious frequency patterns and may exist in different components. In this case it is hard to estimate the noise level and determine appropriate thresholds. (4) EMD-based denoising [7], [21]. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is a method that decomposes the signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). For ECG denoising, IMFs that mainly contain noise are discarded and remaining IMFs are summed to reconstruct the clean signal. Similar to the wavelet transform, EMD decomposes the noise with variable frequency and morphology into multiple IMFs. In addition, the decomposition level needs to be empirically determined. (5) Template-based denoising [25], [28]. Heartbeats in ECG signals usually have a similar shape, and a clean heartbeat template can be estimated by averaging noisy segments. Then different parts of the signal are reconstructed according to the template and finally concatenated to obtain the clean signal.Download : Download high-res image (234KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. The time domain (the first row) and the frequency domain (the second row) representations of (a) ECG signal, (b) baseline wander, (c) motion artifact, and (d) high-frequency noise. The ECG example was extracted from the MIT-BIH database, and the BW, EM, and HF examples were extracted from the ‘bw’, ‘em’, ‘ma’ records of the NST database, respectively.
In short, baseline wander or high-frequency noise can be dealt with well by many methods. However, motion artifact and mixed noise remain the major challenge for the ECG denoising because it is hard to separate the clean signal and different kinds of noises when they are overlapping in both the time and frequency domains. Besides, many traditional denoising methods are not designed for mobile ECG monitoring systems. Several recent studies [29], [30] paid attention to auto-encoders based on neural networks and gained promising results, but the test sets were too small and did not include real ambulatory ECG signals.
More recently, several methods devoted to motion artifact suppression have been reported [31], [32], [33], [34]. Kim et al. [31] proposed a two-stage cascade adaptive filtering for efficient motion artifact removal, where a noise reference signal is required to estimate the characteristics of motion artifact. Unfortunately, the reference signal is difficult to obtain, and it is not always correlated with motion artifact. Accordingly, Ghaleb et al. [32] proposed to estimate the reference signal by the acceleration derivative, which, though, is not as accurate as the real reference signal. In [33], independent component analysis (ICA) was utilized to recover the clean signal from the multi-channel noisy signal containing motion artifacts, but it is not applicable to single-channel signals. In [34], a method based on empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and wavelet thresholding was proposed. The signal was first decomposed into noisy part and clean part by EWT, and then wavelet thresholding was applied to the noisy part to extract residual ECG signal. However, motion artifacts are similar to clean ECG waveforms and may still exist in the clean part, leading to incomplete suppression of noise.
In this study, we propose a multi-stage ECG denoising framework concentrating on the detection of motion artifact based on domain knowledge. In the framework, we first apply the signal variance transform (SVT) to the signal to enhance transient changes. Then we locate motion artifact candidates based on noise estimation and noise-adaptive thresholding. By incorporating domain knowledge, we propose multiple metrics combined with decision rules to find actual motion artifacts, which are suppressed by local scaling and morphological filtering. Finally, the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) and wavelet transform are employed to remove baseline wander and high-frequency noise, respectively. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

•A multi-stage denoising framework is proposed for ambulatory ECG signal to remove mixed noises.•An efficient noise-adaptive motion artifact detection and suppression algorithm is proposed.•The proposed method was evaluated on three different kinds of ECG datasets including real ambulatory signals, and outperformed other state-of-the-art approaches.•The proposed method effectively suppressed QRS-like motion artifacts and hence decreased false positives generated by the QRS detector, which is important for clinical diagnosis.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the data, the proposed multi-stage denoising framework, and the metrics for performance evaluation. In Section 3, we present experimental results on three data sets, including a comparison of different denoising methods. Discussion about methods and results is presented in Section 4. Finally, in Section 5, we draw conclusions and discuss future work.
