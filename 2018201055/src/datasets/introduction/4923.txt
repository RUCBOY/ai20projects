Building accurate knowledge of the identity, the geographic distribution and the evolution of living species is essential for a sustainable development of humanity as well as for biodiversity conservation. Insects are a class of invertebrates within the arthropods that have a exoskeleton, a three-part body (head, thorax and abdomen), three pairs of jointed legs, compound eyes and one pair of antennae. This is a subclass of the Arthropods class which also includes Arachnids, Myriapods and Crustacean and they have been the dominant component of animal species diversity for all of the past 520 million years, since the main burst of the Cambrian radiation. They have been considered to be the earliest colonizers of land [1], [2]. Fossil remains demonstrate that Arthropod species are robust over long periods of time, and that, given the opportunity, they migrate with changing conditions rather than evolving new species [3]. Arthropods are of exceptional value in the reconstruction of paleoenvironments because they are provide detailed, precise information on vegetation, soils, water quality, vertebrate species composition, forest composition and degree of stress [3]. Arthropods represent up to 80% of animal phylum [4] and make up for the largest proportion of species richness at any spatial scale [5]. With 1,5 millions of species, they are more representative for wholesale organism biodiversity than any other group. Arthropods have been recognized as efficient indicators of ecosystem function and recommended for use in conservation planning [6], [7], [8], [9]. Many researchers have assessed habitat quality and measured habitat differences using Arthropods within different ecosystems as well as agricultural, forest and urban landscapes [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. More specifically, arthropod diversity has been used to indicate the impacts of habitat modification [7], [15], [16] to measure the effects of human disturbance [17].
Species identification of Arthropods is a fundamental part of recognizing and describing biodiversity. Traditionally, identification has been based on morphological diagnoses provided by taxonomic studies. Only experts such as taxonomists and trained technicians can identify taxa accurately, because it requires special skills acquired through extensive experience. However, the number of taxonomists and other identification experts has drastically decreased. In some cases a trained technician could make routine identifications using morphological ”keys” (step-by-step instructions of what to look for), but in most cases an experienced professional taxonomist is needed. The use of Arthropods as biotic indicator is slown down by the high level of expertise required to identify insects. It is an obstacle to a broad and easy application [18]. Consequently, alternative and accurate identification methods non-experts can possibly use are required.
Finding automatic methods for such identification is an important topic with many expectations. One of the most common data that can be used in this context are images. Images of arthropods can be acquired and further processed by an image classification system. Such images also have some specificity (see the next sections) and might require adaptation of existing image recognition methods, or new methods.
The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of this domain as thorough as possible. It is structured as follows: Section 2 describes with more precision the scope of this survey and the methodology used to analyze the literature. Section 3 considers the first step of all approaches, i.e., image acquisition. Section 4 is devoted to features extraction, some of them being specific to arthropods. Section 5 describes the classification of the data into known classes. Section 6 details the existing datasets and, finally, Section 7 provides a discussion on this domain, with some conclusions and perspectives.
