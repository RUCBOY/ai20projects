Clouds are important elements when synthesizing images of outdoor scenes to enhance realism. Many methods have therefore been continuously proposed for visual simulation of clouds from the very beginning of the history of computer graphicsÂ Blinn (1982), Max (1986), Gardner (1985). These methods are used in many applications such as flight simulators, movies, computer games, and so on.
There are several important factors for creating realistic images of clouds. The first one is the shapes. The shapes of clouds are defined by three-dimensional density distribution of cloud particles, or water droplets. We need a method for synthesizing a realistic distribution of the cloud particles. Once we have the realistic distribution, we need a method that can compute realistic colors of clouds, taking into account attenuation and scattering of light inside the clouds. This requires the simulation of interactions between light and the small particles, which is usually time-consuming. Moreover, when we want to synthesize animation of clouds, we also need a method that can compute complex but fascinating motions of clouds. Finally, efficiency and controllability are also important factors for applications in computer graphics, such as movies and computer games.
There are tremendous numbers of previous work to meet such requirements descried above. In this article, we review some of those previous work and introduce our continuous efforts for modeling, rendering, and animating clouds realistically. Our inverse approach for visual simulation of clouds is also explained.
