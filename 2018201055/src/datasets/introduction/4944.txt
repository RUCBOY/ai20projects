Photos consist of rich textures and edges. These textures represent fine information and edges capture the structures which are important to human visual perception. Edge-aware image processing has been extensively investigated in recent years due to its applications in computer vision and computational photography. As a special case, edge-aware smoothing is usually employed to improve the visual appearance of an image or to serve as preprocessing for image manipulation such as tone mapping [1], [2], image and video abstraction [3], [4], [5], detail and contrast manipulation [4], [5], and transformation of photographic look [6]. Anisotropic diffusion [7] and bilateral filtering (BLF) [8] are the earliest proposed methods for edge-aware image processing. More recently, many other techniques have been proposed for this task [9], [10], [11], [12], [4].
A good edge-aware image smoothing algorithm should follow two basic principles, that is, to preserve geometric edges which represent the structures of an image and to suppress or remove insignificant details in the texture areas. The major challenging problem in edge-aware image processing, especially for applications which process overall appearance and detail separately, is reducing, or if possible avoiding, artifacts at image edges, i.e., the well known ‘halo’ and ‘gradient reversal’ effects at edge locations in the image detail manipulation. As discussed in [9], methods relying on BLF [11], [13], [14], [15] to separate a mean surface from detail may lead to halos at image edges if too much smoothing is applied. The recent proposed L0 smoothing [4] tends to produce smooth base components with sharp edges. Boosting from those components will cause gradient reversals [5]. Anisotropic diffusion [7] uses a non-linear PDE that depends on local image variation to iteratively smooth an image without blurring important features. However, due to the iteration process, anisotropic diffusion and related PDE-based methods are slow, and furthermore, parameters are difficult to set [16] which makes the anisotropic diffusion based methods unsuitable for practical use. As pointed out in [9], [17], anisotropic diffusion also tends to over-sharpen image edges.
This paper presents an effective edge-aware image smoothing method which can avoid the shortcomings mentioned above. Algorithmically, we formulate the smoothing problem in an optimization framework and express it as a minimization of a convex objective function with a constraint. Specifically, an effective method is presented to distinguish geometric edge pixels and texture pixels, then the penalty term is tuned between the two types of pixels in the objective function. Finally, smoothed image is obtained by solving the optimization problem. Due to the fact that the geometric edges and texture are explicitly distinguished and allocated with different regularization terms. The major edges can be well preserved while the textures can be effectively smoothed. Meanwhile, the ‘halo’ and ‘gradient reversal’ problems exist in previous methods can be well conquered.
The proposed smoothing method can be employed in many applications. In this paper, we have demonstrated its applications to edge extraction and simplification, non-photorealistic rendering, detail and contrast exaggeration, high dynamic range (HDR) tone mapping, block-based discrete cosine transform (BDCT) artifact removal, and content-aware image resizing. Fig. 1 illustrates two typical applications. Details and more applications will be presented in Section 6.Download : Download high-res image (458KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.
