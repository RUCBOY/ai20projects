Over the last five generations of wireless communication, it was proven that each generation required around ten years to be thoroughly investigated and implemented; hence starting research on 6G at such an early stage is justified by the expectation of ten further years until 6G becomes wholly established. Additionally, it is essential to understand that research on 6G means simply working on the techniques that 5G cannot deliver until the arrival of 6G. The desire to explore and achieve this future technology has resulted in making “6G techniques” one of the most searched key terms on Google in recent times; a clear indication of how mainstream the public interest in this field is.
The evaluation of 6th generation wireless communication was recently proposed in [1], where the potential 6G challenges and the expected future technologies were investigated. In [2], the future vision for 6G was summarised in four key terms: intelligent, deep, holographic, and ubiquitous connectivity. As such, proposing Cooperation Network Coding (CoNC) satisfies most of the 6G vision, moreover, [2] presents the technologies that are regarded theoretically as crucial for 6G.
5G already provides the feature of network programming as presented in [3] and [4]; hence 6G is expected to introduce more powerful network programming that could enable the application of Linear Network coding (LNC) technology to improve the communication connectivity for high data rates, mainly in lossy channels where packet losses are expected. On that basis, this paper proposes applying CoNC on 6G and investigating the Bit Error Rate (BER) for the proposed CoNC scenarios.
Network Coding (NC) as a technique was proposed in [5] for a wired multicasting communication scenario, where different packets with equal m-bits sizes were XORed (combined) in one m-bits packet at the physical layer, causing a significant drop in the amount of the propagated packets, resulting in the improvement of the data rates and power efficiency [6], [7], [8], [9]. On the other hand, a network is named a cooperative system when network nodes cooperate in delivering each other’s information, whether NC is applied or not [10], [11]. Accordingly, when linking the NC technique with the cooperation principle, another improvement is achieved regarding diversity and the Packet Error Rate (PER). However, there is a relatively small loss in the BER when using Decode-Re-encode-Amplify and Forward (DF) Base Station (BS). The BER loss when applying Amplify-and-Forward (AF) BS for a small number of nodes, is regarded as acceptable, though it is not as good as DF [11]. Furthermore, [11] shows how implementing CoNC in an erasure channel significantly decreases the Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ).
In [12], NC was applied to an enormous, high-dimensional data transference, such as in Smart Grid, where security and denoising matters were considered. More recent work that involves NC on Smart Grids can be found in [13], [14], and the references therein. The research work in [15] introduces a technique to decompose the overall network to small building blocks of physical NC, which is unlike the proposed work in this paper. This paper is focused on the general physical layer network, primarily to evaluate the effect of applying CoNC at the first stage in terms of two Half-Cycle stages on 6G local mobile network nodes, and then broadcasting additional new Half-Cycle stages when required to achieve full connectivity between all nodes, taking into consideration that 6G provides the ability to program the network as shown in [3] and [4].
The forward error correction techniques applied in this paper are the Partial Unit Memory Turbo Code (PUMTC) (4,2,1,4) and (8,4,3,8) as in [16], where PUMTC is considered as a convolutional code with multiple-input. The maximum free Hamming distance in PUMTC depends on the number of the input memory registers and the number of the input bits achieved in [16]. In PUMTC, the number of memory registers is more than zero and fewer than the number of the input bits, which makes it hold an intermediate position between block (zero memory units) and convolutional codes (the number of memory units is more than the number of input bits), as shown in [16], [17], [18], where M is the memory size, i.e. the number of registers, and k is the number of input bits to the encoder.
 Table 1 shows that the Partial Unit Memory (PUM) code exploits the advantages of both block and convolutional codes, which qualifies PUM to be a suitable and highly recommended forward error correction code for future 6G applications. Judiciously linear error correction codes were introduced in [19] as a novel idea to improve physical layer communication reliability, however [19] neither introduced the principle of soft-decoding in the middle nodes, nor applied CoNC at the first stage. More work was performed on PUMTC, such as the work in both [20], [21], where in [20] a comprehensive theoretical background for using CoNC on wireless network physical-layer is introduced, and in [21] PUMTC was presented to combine data on the physical layer where the cooperation starts after the first stage in a hard-decision decoding manner. The most recent work for the application of CoNC on the physical layer has been presented in [22], where soft and hard decision encoder–decoder PUMTC was used to show the advantages of performance of the soft-decision encoder–decoder over the hard-decision, on a cluster of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). More related work on using CoNC on WSN application was introduced in [23], [24], [25], where in [23] the CoNC improved the diversity. In [24], a cooperative relay was proposed to enhance the mechanism of the retransmission, and in [25], CoNC was applied to improve the routing performance.Table 1. Relative memory complexity of coders [16].Block codePUM codeUM codeConvolutional codeM = 0M < kM = kM > k
Applying CoNC on higher layers, such as the network layer, has been introduced for different purposes and applications [26], [27], [28]. Unlike the work presented in this paper, [26] proposed CoNC performance analysis over a lossy channel that connects M users and a destination, where the CoNC starts after the first stage, i.e. no cooperation at the first stage. In [27], a deterministic CoNC was applied on Long Term Evaluation advanced communication system (LTE), which shows that CoNC is such an excellent technique to enhance the reliability of the system, even when used in a lossy erasure channel. Again, in [27], the CoNC starts after the first stage.
The proposed work in this paper builds upon [28] that suggested using CoNC over a lossy erasure channel at the first stage. As such, the BER loss for Half-Cycle stage transmission that occurred after applying CoNC at the first stage is investigated for a 6G local wireless mobile network. Moreover, soft-decision PUMTC decoding is used to evaluate the system BER’s performance to mitigate the loss in the BER which occurs from combining different packets, as shown in [18].
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 explains the system model, Section 3 introduces the basic concepts of the proposed system model, followed by Section 4, which shows the recommended protocols for 6G local mobile networks based on CoNC, including the proposed NC combination algorithms on the physical layer. The simulation results for the proposed hard and soft-decision PUMTC (4,2,1,4) and (8,4,3,8) are shown in Section 5, to explain results of the BER loss as a trade-off for the obtained gain in the PER. Finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
