Online gambling is unique due to around the clock internet access almost everywhere. Also as a growing industry, online gambling opportunities are continuously increasing. Being cornerstone ecological factors, increased availability and accessibility of online gambling may have considerable influence on the prevalence of at-risk and problem gambling, as suggested by the Pathways model (Blaszczynski & Nower, 2002). Studying gambling mode (i.e. online and land-based), known risky behaviors and gambling-related factors are thus of paramount importance. Here online gambling refers to gambling that takes place over the internet, while land-based gambling refers to brick-and-mortar based services.
1.1. Demographics associated to gambling modeOnline gambling tends to be more common among males, and land-based gambling more common among females (Gainsbury et al., 2015, Gainsbury et al., 2012, Kairouz et al., 2012, McBride and Derevensky, 2009). Nonetheless, online gambling may be more appealing to females than land-based gambling because of its anonymity and less stigmatizing nature (Corney and Davis, 2010, McCormack et al., 2014). Strictly land-based gamblers have been found to be older than those who gamble online (Gainsbury et al., 2015, Kairouz et al., 2012, McBride and Derevensky, 2009), although age related differences have also been concluded to not prevail (Gainsbury et al., 2012). Online gambling has been associated to being married (Gainsbury et al., 2012, Svensson and Romild, 2011) but also to a lower likelihood of being married (Wood & Williams, 2011). Gambling on both online and land-based platforms has been associated to a higher likelihood of working full-time (Gainsbury et al., 2015, Gainsbury et al., 2012) and online gambling to higher income level (Gainsbury et al., 2012, Wood and Williams, 2011) compared to strictly land-based gamblers. On the contrary being a student or unemployed, and particularly for females having low level education and low income have also been associated to online gambling (Gainsbury et al., 2012, Svensson and Romild, 2011).
1.2. Risky behaviors, perceived mental health and gambling modeThe association between online gambling and substance use is somewhat ambiguous. Tobacco, alcohol and illicit drug use were concluded more common among online gamblers than land-based gamblers (Kairouz et al., 2012, Wood and Williams, 2011). In contrast, land-based gamblers have been found to have more gambling related health and psychological problems than online gamblers (Gainsbury, Russell, Hing, Wood, & Blaszczynski, 2013). While controlling for demographic and gambling-related factors, alcohol and drug use have been found to not be associated to either mode of gambling (Gainsbury et al., 2012).Gaming is a progressively popular pastime, which for some may become harmful (Ferguson, Coulson, & Barnett, 2011). Here gaming refers to any form of computer or video gaming. Overlap in gaming and gambling is becoming evident, and online gambling should not be viewed in isolation, as there is an increasing amount of multimedia integration (Griffiths & Parke, 2010). Freemium games that mimic gambling without monetary stakes, social casino games, have been studied in relation to monetary gambling with results suggesting that gamers may migrate to gambling (Elton-Marshall et al., 2016, Gainsbury et al., 2014, Gainsbury et al., 2016).Research has yet to elucidate how gaming in general and gambling are associated with each other. There are similarities between problematic forms of gaming and gambling suggesting that Internet Gaming Disorder could be considered a behavioral addiction along with Gambling Disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013, Duven et al., 2015, Petry and O'Brien, 2013) but very little research has been conducted on this subject (Baggio et al., 2016, Király et al., 2014). Nonetheless, research suggests frequent gaming to be associated to disordered gambling among Finnish adolescents (Castrén, Grainger, Lahti, Alho, & Salonen, 2015). Also, a positive association has been found between the frequency of online gambling and online gaming (Floros, Siomos, Fisoun, & Geroukalis, 2013). Importantly, adolescent online gamblers have been found to display higher levels of problematic internet use and problematic gambling compared to land-based gamblers, even when controlling for the number of gambling games engaged in (Baggio et al., 2016). Few studies have investigated gaming and gambling among older adults (Ariyabuddhiphongs, 2012). Being based on similar interfaces, it is intuitive that online gambling and gaming may co-occur. What is less clear is whether gaming which is excessive or otherwise perceived as detrimental is even more strongly associated to online gambling; some findings suggest an association with mental health problems (Hopley and Nicki, 2010, Petry and Weinstock, 2007, Scholes-Balog and Hemphill, 2012, Wood et al., 2007) while others argue against it (Wood & Williams, 2011).
1.3. Gambling-related factors associated to gambling modePrevious studies show that gambling-related factors (i.e. frequency, number of gambling types, gambling expenditure, and severity of gambling) often have the strongest associations with online gambling. Compared to land-based gamblers, online gamblers tend to gamble more frequently, gamble on a larger amount of gambling types and spend more money on gambling (Elton-Marshall et al., 2016, Gainsbury et al., 2015, Gainsbury et al., 2015, Gainsbury et al., 2012, Gainsbury et al., 2013; Kairouz et al., 2012, Wardle et al., 2011). Additionally, males have been found to gamble on several online gambling types regularly more often than females (McCormack et al., 2014). Financial harms are a core aspect of gambling related harm (Langham et al., 2015), where viewing expenditure proportionately to income may provide added value (Currie et al., 2006). Spending a higher proportion of income on gambling is associated to gambling problems (Currie et al., 2006, Weinstock et al., 2008). Examining expenditure by income has not been compared for online and land-based gamblers to the knowledge of the authors. Considering continuous forms of play and ease of payment, it is plausible that online gamblers end up spending more than their strictly land-based gambling counterparts.Online gamblers (who often also gamble in land-based venues) have been shown to display at-risk and problem gambling more frequently than their land-based gambling counterparts (Elton-Marshall et al., 2016, Gainsbury et al., 2015, Gainsbury et al., 2013, Kairouz et al., 2012, McBride and Derevensky, 2009, Wood and Williams, 2011). It remains somewhat unclear what the relationship is between at-risk and problem gambling and the internet as a mode of gambling. Is the internet intrinsically a detrimental mode for gambling, or do gamblers with elevated risk for developing gambling problems tend to use the internet for gambling more often than non-problem gamblers? Evidence is available that suggests it is not the internet in itself that is harmful, but rather the result of elevated overall engagement in gambling (Gainsbury et al., 2013, Wardle et al., 2011). On the other hand features of online gambling give cause for concern, for example continuous access and anonymity. Thus as a mode of gambling, the internet may assist the progression of gambling problems amongst those at elevated risk (Gainsbury et al., 2013) which would be in line with the conceptualization of the Pathways Model (Blaszczynski & Nower, 2002).
1.4. The Finnish gambling contextGambling opportunities and advertisements are vastly evident in Finland. Gambling in Finland is government regulated with a monopoly. Up until December 2016, the monopoly has been distributed across three providers, all of which have had the right to arrange gambling services on the internet (Lotteries Act, 14 § 20.5.2011/575). The proportion of gambling that takes place on the internet is growing nationally (Salonen & Raisamo, 2015). For example, in 2015 Veikkaus Oy's (provides e.g. sports betting and lottery services in Finland) revenue was 2095.3 million euros, out of which 43.3% was generated from online gambling (Veikkaus, 2016). Based on these internal reports, the share of revenue generated by online gambling increased by 6% since 2013 (Veikkaus, 2016, Veikkaus, 2014).
1.5. The current studyOnline and land-based gamblers have not previously been compared in the Finnish context, and little is known about the gender specific characteristics. Gender specific links of problematic gambling occurring online has been noted as a research area needing more attention (McCormack et al., 2014). Furthermore there is a dearth of evidence evaluating the convergence of gambling and computer gaming (Gainsbury et al., 2016), and previous research on the modes of gambling have often utilized school-based and online samples (Gainsbury et al., 2015, Gainsbury et al., 2012, King et al., 2014, McCormack et al., 2014). Duly, utilizing a nationally representative random sample, this study investigates the gender specific distinctions between online gamblers and land-based gamblers in three domains: demographic characteristics (1), risky behaviors (referring here to tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption and gaming) and perceived mental health (2), and gambling-related factors (number of gambling types gambled; expenditure by net income; severity of gambling problems) (3).
