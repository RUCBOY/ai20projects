For people with chronic respiratory disease, pulmonary rehabilitation has been shown to be effective in reducing dyspnoea and improving quality of life and functional exercise capacity.1 However, the rates of attendance in Australia are poor, with <1% of people with moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) engaging in pulmonary rehabilitation.2 Furthermore, 8 to 50% of people referred to pulmonary rehabilitation do not attend, and 10 to 32% of people who start do not complete the program.3 This can be attributed to the many barriers that exist, which reduce a person’s ability to access pulmonary rehabilitation programs. These barriers include travel time and the costs involved in attending the program site, as well as fatigue, inconvenience and disruption caused to daily activities.3 Novel strategies of pulmonary rehabilitation delivery such as telerehabilitation are of interest because they may increase convenient and equitable access to services, whilst reducing barriers associated with attending centre-based programs for people with chronic respiratory disease.
Telehealth is an evolving healthcare delivery system that employs various technology modalities to overcome the barriers that people face in accessing services. Pulmonary telerehabilitation is defined as the delivery of pulmonary rehabilitation services via telecommunication and videoconference technologies.4 There are various models of pulmonary telerehabilitation, including: in-home videoconferencing,5, 6, 7, 8 videoconferencing from a central centre to a satellite centre,9 mobile phone-based exercise programs,10 a combination of videoconferencing and telephone support,11 and web-based self-monitoring.12, 13, 14 Two systematic reviews evaluating telerehabilitation programs for people with cardiopulmonary disease concluded that telerehabilitation programs provide similar improvements in exercise capacity as centre-based programs15 and have higher compliance rates.16 A recent study, not included in these systematic reviews, was the first randomised, controlled trial of an 8-week in-home videoconferencing telerehabilitation exercise program compared with usual medical care in people with COPD. The study found that the telerehabilitation exercise group had statistically significant improvements in endurance exercise capacity and self-efficacy with high satisfaction and completion rates compared to the usual care group.5, 17
Engaging with pulmonary telerehabilitation using videoconferencing requires patients to have access to and use technological devices with an internet connection. In a COPD telemedicine trial, it was found that technical concerns (eg, not wanting a computer in the home) and personal concerns (eg, feeling too old to adopt new technology) were barriers to people using telerehabilitation.18 Previous research into the use of technology in other chronic diseases, including diabetes,19 lung cancer20 and chronic cardiopulmonary conditions,21 have reported mixed results in the access and use of technology. In a diabetic population, the ‘willingness’ to use telehealth technology was significantly associated with the uptake of telerehabilitation.19 To date, no research has investigated the access and use of technology, the willingness to use technology for disease management, and the factors relating to accessing health information online in the pulmonary rehabilitation population.
Therefore, the research questions for this cross-sectional, multi-centre survey were:
1.What is the level of technology engagement by people attending pulmonary rehabilitation, including the access to, use of and self-reported level of competence in using technology devices?2.Are a participant’s demographics and factors related to technology engagement associated with the likelihood of researching health information online and willingness to use telerehabilitation?
