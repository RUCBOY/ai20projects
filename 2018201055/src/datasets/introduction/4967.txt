Many problems in computer vision in pattern recognition area can be solved by graph matching methods [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. Graph matching problem that incorporates pairwise constraints can be formulated as an integer quadratic programming (IQP) problem with affine mapping constraint encoding one-to-one mapping constraint. The optimal solution of IQP matching problem should satisfy both discrete and affine mapping constraints simultaneously. Since it is known to be NP-hard, relaxation methods are usually required to find approximate solutions for this problem [8], [6], [9], [10], [11], [12]. One kind of popular relaxation methods is to first develop a new continuous problem by relaxing the discrete mapping constraint and then aim to find the optimum for this relaxed continuous problem. Since the optimum of the relaxed matching problem is usually continuous, thus a post-optimization step (discretization step) is further required to obtain the final discrete (binary) mapping solution [9], [10], [11], [13]. One main limitation is that the required post-optimization step is generally independent of the matching objective optimization and thus may lead to weak local optimum for original IQP matching problem. Another kind of relaxation method is to try to optimize IQP matching problem in a discrete domain [14]. This method can generate a solution obeying the discrete affine mapping constraint strictly for original IQP matching problem, and thus does not require any post-optimization step in the optimization process [14]. However, the optimality of this discrete method is usually limited. Zhou and la Torre [12] proposed an effective graph matching method which first exploited the factorized properties of the affinity matrix and then optimized the factorized graph matching problem using a path-following algorithm [15]. This method is usually time consuming because it needs to solve a series of sub-problems. From the game-theoretical perspective, Albarelli et al. [16], [17] have proposed a new relaxation model which aims to optimize the matching problem in a simplex domain, i.e., ℓ1-norm constraint in nonnegative domain. For convenience, we call it as GameM in the following. Due to the ℓ1-norm constraint, GameM can induce a sparse (approximate discrete) solution for the matching problem [17]. One drawback is that the mapping constraint encoding one-to-one mapping has been entirely ignored in GameM. Also, the sparsity of GameM solution is usually uncontrollable to obtain the desired discrete solution [17], [18]. In addition to optimization-based methods, probabilistic methods can also be used for solving matching problems [8], [3].
In this paper, a new graph matching method has been proposed. The main contributions are twofold: First, a new relaxation model, called Lagrangian relaxation graph matching (LRGM), has been proposed for solving IQP matching problem. LRGM has two aspects: (1) the affine mapping constraint is explicitly incorporated in LRGM relaxation via Lagrangian regularization. (2) By imposing ℓ1-norm constraint on related solution, empirically LRGM can also lead to a sparse solution and thus maintains the discrete constraint strongly. Thus, LRGM provides a tight relaxation intuitively for original IQP problem by incorporating both affine mapping and discrete binary constraint simultaneously. Second, an effective multiplicative optimization algorithm has been proposed to solve LRGM model. The convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed. Another important property of this algorithm is that it leads to an optimal solution which can satisfy the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) optimal condition.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the general formulation of graph matching problem as an integer quadratic programming problem. In Section 3, we briefly review some related works. In Section 4, we propose our LRGM model and develop a multiplicative update algorithm to solve it. Some benefits of the proposed LRGM method are demonstrated in Section 5. At last, we apply LRGM method to some matching tasks.
