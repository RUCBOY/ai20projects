Electric impact drills are widely used in construction industry and home appliances. Commutator motors (part of the electric impact drill) are used for different types of power tools: demolishing hammers, hammers for forging, angle drills, electric and cordless screwdrivers, double grinders, grinders for concrete, wet grinders, chainsaw, circular saws, milling machines, reciprocating saws. Faults of mechanical and electrical parts of the machine may lead to economic losses (production downtimes). Furthermore diagnostic methods can decrease losses and ensure the safety of operators.
Thermal imaging is used for many application such as: monitoring of industry, monitoring of inflammation caused by the early stages of disease, recognition of emotions, border monitoring, searching for missing people in mountains. Industrial applications of thermal imaging can be following: health check of human, health check in dairy farms, preventing fires at coal power plants, factory inspection, gas leak detection, non-destructive testing, motor inspection.
Few papers have been devoted to power tools. The article describes fault diagnosis method based on analysis of thermal images. The method of feature extraction (BCAoID â€“ Binarized Common Areas of Image Differences) of thermal images is proposed. The BCAoID extracted features of thermal images. Next, features were analyzed using the Nearest Neighbor classifier and backpropagation neural network. Sections of the paper are following: 1) Introduction, 2) Analyzed faults of the EID, 3) Overview of current knowledge, 4) Experimental setup for the analysis of thermal images of the EID, 5) Analysis of thermal images of the EID, 6) Discussion, 7) Conclusions.
