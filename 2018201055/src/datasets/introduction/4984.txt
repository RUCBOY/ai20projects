When Allan Turing developed the concept of universal Turing machine (UTM), the computational processes could be measured considering the number of operations that is necessary to the UTM, to perform the algorithm related to them [1].
Considering general computational algorithms, Kolmogorov formalized the concept of computational complexity in a rigorous mathematical way [2], which is very useful for software and hardware designers [3].
The parallel development of Shannon information theory [4] allowed strong improvements in communication technology. Moreover, the concept of informational entropy became popular and it has been applied in several areas of knowledge [5].
Concerning to computational complexity, it was shown that measuring it through an algorithm approach is equivalent to using the concept of informational entropy [3]. Consequently, maximum computational complexity corresponds to an equiprobable process [3] and, extending the idea to Thermodynamics, is related to thermodynamical equilibrium [6].
Consequently, this approach is not convenient to be applied to natural phenomena because, as asserted by Anand and Orlóci [7], and Kaneko and Tsuda [8], there is no complexity in situations presenting zero or maximum entropy.
In order to solve this problem, López-Ruiz, Mancini and Calbet proposed a definition for complexity, the LMC measure [9]. Shiner, Davison and Landsberg, by slightly changing the definition of LMC, proposed the SDL measure [10].
Both measures combine equilibrium (disorder) and disequilibrium (order) parameters resulting in expressions for complexity. Several problems were successfully studied with this approach as, for instance, in Biology [11], [12] and Meteorology [13], but with criticism concerning the same weight to order and disorder.
In Neuroscience, for instance, it is claimed that complexity is due to order [14], in Psychiatry to disorder [15]. However, weighting order and disorder according to the situation to be analyzed is simple for LMC or SDL measures. Here, a method of weighting order and disorder is developed, using the support of binomial distribution [16] and showing how weights affect complexity.
In the next section, some theoretical hints are presented, emphasizing how to introduce weights in LMC and SDL complexity measures. Then, a section of computational experiments, with the binomial distribution, shows the numerical effects of weighting complexity measures. A section of conclusions completes the work.
