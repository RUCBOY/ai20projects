Laser beams with a top-hat profile, also known as flat-top, possess a uniform intensity distribution over the cross-sectional area. Recently, many fields of laser application have been adopting either this type of laser source or some methods to imitate the effect of the top-hat beams [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. Conventional super-resolution microscopy using a Gaussian-like irradiance profile has revolutionized research fields of science and application by providing the optical resolution beyond the diffraction limit [1]. However, inhomogeneous illumination from the laser with the Gaussian profile gives rise to some quality degradation of the output results. For this reason, many research groups have experimentally demonstrated that the uniform illumination of light beams can alleviate these experimental artifacts [1], [2], [3], [4]. In addition to these imaging applications, high power ultrafast lasers have been widely used for material processing [5], [6], [7] and surface structuring [8], [9]. Because the shape of the processed area by the ultrafast laser critically depends on the intensity distribution, it is essential for preparing flat-top beams to generate the desired pattern on the surface of target materials [5], [6]. Another representative example is atom interferometry. Light-pulse atom interferometer using the wave property of laser-cooled atoms measures the phase difference between matter waves of different paths, and it is useful for inertial sensors with high-sensitivity and high-accuracy [10], [11], [12]. Spatial inhomogeneity induced by the Gaussian field distribution across the cold atoms decreases optical efficiency and results in detrimental effects such as a low signal to noise ratio [12]. Mielec et al. [12] experimentally verified that the application of top-hat beams significantly improves the performance of atom interferometers. We focus on the generation of top-hat line-shaped beams in particular. Line-shaped beams with uniformity could be applied to all applications described above and have more advantages such as large-area processing, low artifacts, and scanning speed [5].
Top-hat beams can be generated by a variety of methods based on either refractive optics [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] or diffractive optics [18], [19], [20], [21]. The basic principle of refractive beam shaping by two aspheric lenses was initially introduced by Frieden [13]. Since the first description by Frieden, the generation of the top-hat beams using a refractive optical system has been widely investigated both theoretically and experimentally [14], [15], [16]. The refractive optics can generate the desired flat-top distribution without any diffraction loss, and the fabrication of the aspheric lenses is relatively easier than the fabrication of diffractive optical elements (DOE) [16]. However, the system is critically affected by the input profile and has difficulty in producing arbitrary intensity patterns [17]. In contrast, DOE is a powerful technique for transforming incident laser beams to arbitrary intensity patterns, which can produce not only top-hat beams but also a variety of shapes, and even lattice structures [19]. In particular, a spatial light modulator (SLM) as a diffractive phase element is the most promising tool for beam shaping due to its dynamic control and high conversion efficiency [5], [20].
In this paper, we adopt optical coordinate transformation using an SLM to make line-shaped beams with a top-hat profile. The transformation principle is based on conformal mapping, also referred to as angle-preserving transformation, in mathematics [22], [23], [24]. Input fields with a Gaussian distribution are mapped to a parallel line in the log-polar coordinates that comprise two orthogonal axes, one for the logarithm of the distance from the origin and the other one for the polar angle from the reference line, usually x-axis. In principle, not only the Gaussian but also any light beams with a circular symmetry, such as concentric circles and rings, can be changed. However, a split line of the transforming element gives rise to diffraction, which produces high peaks and a sinusoidal pattern. Therefore, we apply amplitude modulation to mitigate the effect of diffraction and produce a nearly perfect top-hat beam. An interferometer setup with dove prisms is additionally employed to compensate for quality degradation caused by experimental limitations. As a proof of concept, we perform numerical simulations with fast Fourier transform (FFT) and split-step Fourier method (SSFM) and compare them with experimental results. After that, we quantitatively examine the expected performance of the proposed scheme with the numerical simulations. For better understanding, the quality of the generated top-hat profile is compared with the well-known super-Gaussian profiles. Finally, the merits of the proposed method are qualitatively discussed by comparison with the closed form solution, using optical geometric transformation, treated by Romero and Dickey [18], [25]. This study aims to provide the tunable and practical method for generating uniform line-shaped beams.
