Many sonographers experience musculoskeletal pain and discomfort in the neck, upper limbs and back (Morton and Delf, 2008, Muir et al., 2004, Pike et al., 1997, Roll et al., 2012, Russo et al., 2002). Sonographic scanning involves static postures and precise movements of the upper limbs (Kim and Roh, 2014, Pike et al., 1997, Wihlidal and Kumar, 1997), which are well known risk factors for neck and upper limb pain (Hagberg, 1996). Furthermore, it involves considerable computer work, in itself a risk factor for pain (Tornqvist et al., 2009). The scanning usually takes place in a dark room, which may lead to eye strain (Wihlidal and Kumar, 1997). However, the extent to which visual ergonomics affects the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs) is not known.
Sonography yields information on composition of i.a. internal organs, muscles, blood flow and is used in several specialities, such as cardiology, obstetrics, gynecology and radiology. It provides precise information and there is very little risk of adverse events for the patient (Douglas et al., 2007, Frank et al., 2015). Sonographic examinations have become more common over the past decades (Baker and Coffin, 2013, Schoenfeld et al., 1999), with an increase in the number of examinations and hours of scanning per day for sonographers (Baker and Coffin, 2013, Russo et al., 2002). This may lead to higher prevalence of WMSDs.
Sonography of the heart (echocardiography) has become an invaluable diagnostic tool in daily cardiology practice (Badano et al., 2009, Douglas et al., 2007). Echocardiography requires high grip forces in the transducer hand due to the depth of the scanned organ (Bastian et al., 2009). Increased force in the hand grip may lead to an additionally increased risk of developing musculoskeletal disorders (Vanderpool et al., 1993). Due to the set up in the examination room, echocardiography is performed in one of a limited number of working techniques, but it is not known whether any of these is more favourable in terms of the risk of WMSDs.
The aim of this study was to explore associations between physical and psychosocial working conditions and pain in the neck, shoulders, elbows and hands, in order to propose recommendations for improved working conditions for sonographers. Special attention was paid to the working conditions in echocardiography.
