The developments of optical technology on image encryption and authentication have received great attention since the last two decades. Many optics-based image encryption/authentication algorithms with distinct optical structures were proposed for the diverse applications [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. First, Refregier et al. proposed the double random phase encryption (DRPE) method based on the 4-Æ’ optical structure using the optical Fourier transform (FT) [1]. Then, various optical encryption/authentication methods on the basis of FT [2], [3], [4], [6], Fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) [5], [8], [9], and Fresnel transform (FrT) [10], [11], [12] are developed. The DRPE algorithm utilizes two random phase functions to encrypt the plain image as the encrypted data, which consist of both the amplitude and phase information. In decryption, the conjugate phase information is required for restoring the plain image at the output plane. Thereafter, successive studies on optical encryption [1], [2], [3], [4], [5] have been developed. As to the image authentication problems, the phase functions are retrieved to reconstruct the target images. To solve such a problem, a lot of studies introduce the iterative processes based on the DRPE [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] to retrieve the phase functions which can be used to reconstruct the target images at the output plane.
Wang et al. proposed an alternative [2], which, with iterations, encoded the original image to the phase-only function (POF) on the Fourier plane in a 4-f structure. Li et al. modified such a method [3] by encrypting the original image as the POF at the input plane and achieved more convenient applications. Chang et al. further modified the method to retrieve double POFs at both the input and Fourier planes to achieve higher security and better image reconstruction quality [6]. In addition to the FT, Situ and Zhang proposed an iterative algorithm [12] to separately retrieve two POFs at the input and FrT plane without using any lens to make the implementation easier. Compared with the previous methods, encoding an original image to the POFs on the Fresnel plane through the iterative algorithm provides the following advantages: (1) The fewer optical components are used since there is no lens required. (2) In addition to the POFs as the keys, the wavelength and position parameters in the FrT can also be the keys to obtain higher security. (3) The encrypted data could be directly delivered through the information channel as the public key. Then legal users can complete the decryption with correct FrT parameters and the secret phase key.
In addition to the single image encryption, a lot of methods especially for multiple-image encryption have been proposed. Situ and Zhang proposed the wavelength- and position-based optical image multiplexing methods in the FrT domain [14], [15]. The double-phase encryption is utilized for encoding each original image. Then, the final encrypted image is simply generated with superposition. In decryption, however, the crosstalk among the images limits the number of images for multiplexing. This method is especially not suitable for multiple grayscale images because the decrypted image quality would be significantly worse than the binary ones. Hwang et al. further utilized the modified Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm (MGSA) [11] for the multiple image encryption based on wavelength and position multiplexing [16], [17], [18] to improve the cryptosystem performances on crosstalk resistance and image quality. Compared to the single POF method [16], the methods using two POFs [17], [18] in the encryption process can enhance the security of the cryptosystem. Moreover, more information, such as the distance between two POFs in the optical architecture and the wavelength of incident light, are required for accurately recovering the target images in decryption and this does enhance the system security. However, there is a disadvantage in our previous methods [17], [18]. If one of the double POFs is known and the other is not, the silhouette of the target image is still visible. Therefore, the security of such an authentication system is not high enough. On the other hand, according to the analyses on the system parameters in past methods, there are certain restrictions on the optical architecture in order to acquire better quality on the reconstruction images [21].
In addition to the MGSA for generating the double POFs in the optical image multiplexing systems, Chang et al. proposed the multiple-phase retrieval algorithm (MPRA) [6] based on the DRPE and projection onto constraint sets (POCS) algorithms [23]. Through the threshold criteria for the iterated images at the reconstruction plane and the phase only constraint, more than two POFs located on the FT and inverse Fourier transform (IFT) planes are determined when the convergence condition has been achieved. The MPRA can arbitrarily select the number (at least two) of retrieved POFs and can also be easily extended to retrieve the POFs at the planes in the FrFT and FrT domains. For the case of retrieving two POFs in the MPRA, which can be named as the double-phase retrieval algorithm (DPRA), both the convergence speed of the iteration process and the reconstructed image quality are better than that in the previous methods [14], [15]. Therefore, in this paper, a different optical image encryption and multiplexing method based on the DPRA in the FrT domain is proposed. By using the similar phase modulation schemes in our previous wavelength and position multiplexing methods for multiple images [17], [18], each target image can be encrypted into a secret phase key with a common phase lock, which is the summarization of all the modulated POFs. The proposed method can achieve higher system security than that in our previous methods [17], [18] because no visible silhouettes in the reconstructed images can be observed.
The rest of this paper is organized as following: The DPRA in the FrT domain is described in Section 2. Section 3 deals with the proposed image encryption and multiplexing method. The numerical simulation results are provided in Section 4. Finally, the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.
