Recently, metal oxide semiconductor thin-film transistors (TFTs) have attracted much attention as key flexible electronic devices [1]. Among these metal oxide semiconductor TFTs, amorphous InGaZnO (a-InGaZnO) TFTs show the high mobility, low leak current, and large-area uniform integration [2]. The widespread applications of a-InGaZnO TFTs in sensors [3], [4], memories [5], high-functionality circuits [6], [7], and flexible displays [8] require a physics-based compact model to optimize process and explain the electrical characteristics for circuit simulators.
Since the exponential tail and deep trap states [9] have to be considered in modelling a-InGaZnO TFTs, only a few analytical models [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] of a-InGaZnO TFTs have been proposed, which are devoted to accurately descript I-V characteristics. By introducing the effective carrier density, Bae et al. [10] and Tsormpatzoglou et al. [11] proposed drain current models, respectively. However, these two models [10], [11] are piece-wise. Furthermore, Deng et al. [12] developed an explicit closed-form model for a-InGaZnO TFTs, which utilized an initial and complicated estimate of surface potential. Through a single iteration of Newton-Raphson method and an initial guess solution of the band bending, Ghittorelli et al. [13] gave a surface-potential-based model. Subsequently, Zhong et al. [14] provided a description of DC device characteristics. In the above two models [13], [14], only exponential tail trap density of states is included, deep trap density of states is ignored. Up to now, a physics-based and one-piece drain current compact model for a-InGaZnO TFTs including double exponent tail and deep trap state distribution is still necessary urgently for circuit simulators.
In this paper, based on the explicit calculation of the surface potential, we utilize the charge sheet approach to develop a physics-based compact I-V model for a-InGaZnO TFTs accounting for both tail and deep trap states. The proposed model is accurate and continuous in all operational regions. In the process of calculating the surface potential, saturation voltage is defined, dominant physical phenomena asymptotic is used in calculation, correction is not necessary to improve accuracy, and corresponding explanation about the effect from DOS on surface potential results is expound clearly. In the drain current model, both tail and deep trap densities per unit area are calculated depending on the electric potential in the a-InGaZnO film. Subsequently, inherently continuous drain current can be accurately determined by using charge sheet model (CSM). Finally, the proposed analytical and physics-based compact model is validated by the numerical calculations and measurements. Hence, it can explain the electrical characteristics of a-InGaZnO TFTs and be suitable for computer-aided-design (CAD) implementation.
