One of the major open problems in asymptotic convex geometry is the famous Kannan-Lovász-Simonovits (KLS) conjecture. This conjecture has its origin in theoretical computer science and arose in the study of sampling algorithms for high-dimensional convex bodies. One specific situation of interest in the theory is to design an algorithm that efficiently computes the volume of an n-dimensional convex body. Such an algorithm is fed with a convex body K⊆Rn and a quality parameter ε∈(0,∞), where the body K is represented by a membership oracle, which, for each x∈Rn can decide whether or not x∈K. The algorithm returns a number V=V(K,ε)∈R such that(1−ε)voln(K)≤V≤(1+ε)voln(K) and the efficiency of the designed algorithm is measured in terms of the number of arithmetic operations and calls to the membership oracle. While deterministic algorithms are deemed to be inefficient (see the works of Bárány and Füredi [4] and of Elekes [14]), there are reasonable randomized algorithms available that can accurately compute the volume of convex bodies with high probability in polynomial time, see Dyer, Frieze, and Kannan [13]. At its core, the construction of this randomized algorithm is connected to an isoperimetric inequality for log-concave probability measures on Rn (see, e.g., [1] for an introduction to the KLS conjecture and [38] for a more detailed explanation on its connection with problems in theoretical computer science). The constant appearing in this isoperimetric inequality, known as Cheeger's constant, is of particular interest and directly linked to the KLS conjecture, which by the work of Rothaus, Cheeger, Maz'ya, and Ledoux (see, e.g., [7, Theorem 1.1]) can be stated as follows:
KLS Conjecture. There exists an absolute constant C∈(0,∞) such that for all n∈N, every centered random vector X with log-concave distribution and any locally Lipschitz function f:Rn→R such that f(X) is of finite variance,Var[f(X)]≤CλX2E[‖∇f(X)‖22], where λX2:=supθ∈Sn−1⁡E〈X,θ〉2.
Using what is known as the localization lemma, Kannan, Lovász, and Simonovits proved the conjecture with a factor (E‖X‖2)2 instead of λX2 (see [26]), and later Bobkov [9] improved this estimate. But besides the fact that the KLS conjecture holds for exponential and Gaussian random vectors and has attracted considerable attention in the past 25 years, there has been very little progress to the present day (see [8] and [19] for a proof of the conjecture for the class of revolution bodies, [6] for the case of the simplex, [30] and [36] for the case of the ℓpn-balls, [29] for the case of 1-unconditional bodies with an extra log⁡n factor, and [32] for the best general estimate of the constant of the order n in the KLS conjecture). One of the reasons for the interest in the KLS conjecture is that, if correct, it would imply several other well-known conjectures in asymptotic convex geometry, including the variance conjecture (which is the special case f(⋅)=‖⋅‖2) and the hyperplane conjecture. This brings us to the first purpose of this paper, which is to establish a connection between the KLS conjecture and the study of so-called large and moderate deviations principles for isotropic log-concave random vectors.
While the study of central limit theorems for random geometric quantities in asymptotic convex geometry is by now a classical and still flourishing part of the theory, as can be seen in [3], [18], [20], [21], [22], [23], [28], [34], [35], fluctuations beyond the Gaussian scale have only recently attracted attention in this context. For one, there are the large deviations, or more precisely large deviations principles, which determine the asymptotic likelihood of rare events on a scale of a law of large numbers, the most classical result in this direction being Cramér's theorem [10] (see also [12]). Contrary to the universality shown by a central limit theorem, the large deviation behavior is typically sensitive to the distribution of the underlying random objects. Being a classical topic in probability theory, large deviations have only recently been introduced in asymptotic convex geometry and high-dimensional probability by Gantert, Kim, and Ramanan [15]. They obtained a large deviations principle for 1-dimensional projections of ℓpn-balls in Rn as the space dimension n tends to infinity, showing how the speed and rate depend on the parameter p and thus in a subtle way on the geometry of the body. Their work inspired a number of investigations regarding the large deviations behavior of quantities that naturally appear in asymptotic convex geometry, such as Sanov-type large deviations for the random spectral measure of a properly normalized matrix chosen uniformly at random in the unit ball of a Schatten p-class [24] (a non-commutative analogue of a result previously obtained by Kim and Ramanan for random vectors in high-dimensional ℓpn-spheres [27]), large deviations principles for ℓq-norms of random vectors in ℓpn-balls [22], [23], a description of the large deviations behavior for the Euclidean norm of orthogonal projections of ℓpn-balls to high-dimensional random subspaces [2], and, very recently, large deviations under an asymptotic thin-shell condition [37] as well as geometric sharp large deviations for random projections of ℓpn-spheres [33]. The question now arises of what can be said about the asymptotic likelihood of events on a scaling between Gaussian fluctuations covered by the central limit theorem and large deviations? This scaling is exactly the one covered by the so-called moderate deviations principles, which are nothing but large deviations principles of differently normalized random variables. However, in contrast to large deviations, the so-called moderate deviations principles are typically non-parametric in rate. In fact, usually moderate deviations principles inherit properties from both the central limit theorem and the large deviations principle in that the central limit theorem is still visible in form of a Gaussian (quadratic) rate function, while probabilities decay on an exponential scale as in the large deviations principle. In the framework of random geometric quantities in asymptotic convex geometry those have first been considered by Kabluchko, Prochno, and Thäle in [23] for ℓq-norms of random vectors in ℓpn-balls.
Now, let us be more precise and introduce what a large or moderate deviations principle formally is and then describe its relation to the KLS conjecture. We recall that a sequence (Xn)n∈N of random vectors in d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd satisfies a large deviations principle (LDP) with speed sn and rate function I:Rd→[0,∞] if(1)−infx∈A∘⁡I(x)≤liminfn→∞sn−1log⁡P[Xn∈A]≤limsupn→∞sn−1log⁡P[Xn∈A]≤−infx∈A‾⁡I(x) for all Borel measurable A⊆Rd, where A∘ denotes the interior and A‾ the closure of A, and where I is lower semi-continuous and has compact level sets {x∈Rd:I(x)≤α}, α∈R. So loosely speaking, an LDP says that if n∈N is sufficiently large and A⊆Rd sufficiently regular, thenP[Xn∈A]≈e−sninfx∈A⁡I(x). As mentioned before, a moderate deviations principle (MDP) is nothing else than an LDP for a differently normalized sequence of random variable. Namely, if a sequence (tn−1Xn)n∈N of random variables satisfies an LDP with some speed and some rate function, an LDP for the sequence random variables t˜n−1Xn with t˜n→∞ and t˜n=o(tn) is referred to as a moderate deviations principle, see [11, Chapter 3.7] and especially part (c) of the remark after Theorem 3.7.1 for further details on terminology. Typically, the reference to an LDP corresponds to the scaling that provides deviations at the scale of a law of large numbers, as Cramér's theorem does for sums of independent random variables, and LDPs at the scales providing deviations between that of a weak limit theorem (like a central limit theorem) and that of a law of large numbers are referred to as MDPs. In this paper, for two sequences (xn)n∈N and (yn)n∈N we use the Landau notation xn=o(yn) if limn→∞⁡xnyn=0 and xn=ω(yn) if limn→∞⁡|xnyn|=+∞. In addition, we write xn≈yn if there exist two absolute constants c1,c2 such that c1xn≤yn≤c2xn. The following result establishes a connection between the KLS conjecture and moderate/large deviations principles. Essentially, it is a consequence of the fact, known from [1], [17], [31], that the KLS conjecture would imply a sharp concentration bound for the Euclidean norm of isotropic log-concave random vectors.
Theorem A LDPs/MDPs and the KLS conjectureLet 1≤kn≤n be a sequence of integers such that kn=ω(1) and let (ξn)n=1∞ be a sequence of isotropic log-concave random vectors in Rkn. Consider a sequence of random variables Xn=‖ξn‖2kn, n∈N, which satisfies (1) with speed sn and rate function I. Assume that one of the following two conditions is satisfied:(a)sn=o(kn) and I is non-singular, i.e., I(x)≠I0(x)={0:x=1+∞:otherwise.(b)sn≈kn and inft>t0⁡infx∈(t,∞)⁡I(x)t=0 for some absolute constant t0∈(1,∞). Then the KLS conjecture is false.
