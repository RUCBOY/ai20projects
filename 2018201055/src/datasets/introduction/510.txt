Scheduling to minimize mean response time1  of the M/G/k queue is an important problem in queueing theory. The single-server k=1 case has been well studied. If the scheduler has access to each job’s exact size, the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) policy is easily shown to be optimal [1]. If the scheduler does not know job sizes, which is very often the case in practical systems, then a more complex policy called the Gittins policy is known to be optimal [2], [3], [4]. The Gittins policy tailors its priority scheme to the job size distribution, and it takes a simple form in certain special cases. For example, for distributions with decreasing hazard rate (DHR), Gittins becomes the foreground-background (FB) policy,2  so FB is optimal in the M/G/1 for DHR job size distributions [2], [3], [5].
In contrast to the M/G/1, the M/G/k with k≥2 has resisted exact analysis, even for very simple scheduling policies. As such, much less is known about minimizing mean response time in the M/G/k, with the only nontrivial results holding under heavy traffic.3  For known job sizes, recent work by Grosof et al. [6] shows that a multiserver analogue of SRPT is optimal in the heavy-traffic M/G/k. For unknown job sizes, Grosof et al. [6] address only the case of DHR job size distributions, showing that a multiserver analogue of FB is optimal in the heavy-traffic M/G/k.4  But in general, optimal scheduling is an open problem for unknown job sizes, even in heavy traffic. We therefore ask: 
What scheduling policy minimizes mean response time in the heavy-traffic M/G/k with unknown job sizes and general job size distribution?
This is a very difficult question. In order to answer it, we draw upon several recent lines of work in scheduling theory.

•As part of their heavy-traffic optimality proofs,  Grosof et al. [6] use a tagged job method to stochastically bound M/G/k response time under each of SRPT and FB relative to M/G/1 response time (Fig. 2.1) under the same policy.•Lin et al. [7] and Kamphorst and Zwart [8] characterize the heavy-traffic scaling of M/G/1 mean response time under SRPT and FB, respectively.•Scully et al. [9] show that a policy called monotonic shortest expected remaining processing time (M-SERPT), which is considerably simpler than Gittins, has M/G/1 mean response time within a constant factor of that of Gittins.
While these prior results do not answer the question on their own, together they suggest a plan of attack for proving optimality in the heavy-traffic M/G/k.
When searching for a policy to minimize mean response time, a natural candidate is a multiserver analogue of Gittins. As a first step, one might hope to use the tagged job method of Grosof et al. [6] to stochastically bound M/G/k response time under Gittins relative to M/G/1 response time. Unfortunately, the tagged job method does not apply to multiserver Gittins, because it relies on both stochastic and worst-case properties of the scheduling policy, whereas Gittins has poor worst-case properties.
One of our key ideas is to introduce a new variant of Gittins, called monotonic Gittins (M-Gittins), that has better worst-case properties than Gittins while maintaining similar stochastic properties. This allows us to generalize the tagged job method [6] to M-Gittins, thus bounding its M/G/k response time relative to its M/G/1 response time.
Our M/G/k analysis of M-Gittins reduces the question of whether M-Gittins is optimal in the heavy-traffic M/G/k to analyzing the heavy-traffic scaling of M-Gittins’s M/G/1 mean response time. However, there are no heavy-traffic scaling results for the M/G/1 under policies other than SRPT [7], FB [8], first-come, first served (FCFS) [10], [11], and a small number of other simple policies [12], [13]. To remedy this, we derive heavy-traffic scaling results for M-Gittins in the M/G/1. It turns out that analyzing M-Gittins directly is very difficult. Fortunately, M-Gittins has a simpler cousin, M-SERPT, which Scully et al. [9] introduce and analyze. We analyze M-SERPT in heavy traffic as a key stepping stone in our heavy-traffic analysis of M-Gittins.
This paper makes the following contributions:

•We introduce the M-Gittins policy and prove that it minimizes mean response time in the heavy-traffic M/G/k for a large class of finite-variance job size distributions (Theorem 3.1).•We also prove that the simple and practical M-SERPT policy is a 2-approximation for mean response time in the heavy-traffic M/G/k for a large class of finite-variance job size distributions (Theorem 3.2).•We characterize the heavy-traffic scaling of mean response time in the M/G/1 under Gittins, M-Gittins, and M-SERPT (Theorem 3.3).
Section 3 formally states these results and compares them to prior work. Their proofs rely on a large collection of intermediate results, which we outline in detail in Section 4 and prove in Sections 5 M/G/, 6 Rank function bounds, 7 Heavy-traffic scaling of M/G/1 waiting and residence times.
