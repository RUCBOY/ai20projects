Globally, more than half of the available freshwater resources have been altered by human activities due to the presence and the applications of different types of contaminants (Zhu et al., 2008; Setia et al., 2020; Dong et al., 2021; Xiao et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2021), and heavy metals, pesticides and small molecules are the predominant water-borne chemicals (Oyetibo et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018).
The major sources of heavy metals in aquatic environments are industrial activities such as mining, papermaking, tanning, manufacture of batteries and electroplating (Fu and Wang, 2011; Ren et al., 2017a; Zhang et al., 2017). For example, in China, the annual discharge of wastewater containing heavy metals from electroplating industries alone exceeds 4 billion tons (Fang et al., 2011). Copper sulphate (CuSO4) is used in many industrial activities (including pesticide industries) (Boyle et al., 2020; Lusk and Chapman, 2020), and could be found in industrial effluents with the concentration up to 0.14 mg/L (Lusk and Chapman, 2020).
A variety of organic chemicals-based pesticides are used in agricultural activities to control crop pests, among which organophosphorus group-based pesticides are predominant (Ren et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015; Ullah et al., 2018). For example, malathion (C10H19O6PS2) is a non-systemic organophosphorus pesticide that is used commonly to control crop pests (Poomagal et al., 2021), and the concentration in water ecosystem could be up to 6.17 mg/mL as mentioned by Poomagal et al. (2021). Malathion might reach the water ecosystem easily through different ways including rains, irrigation activities, and discharge of wastewaters.
Another type of common water pollutant is small molecule, in which ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) is a non-heavy metal compound. It is reported that more than 2.4 million cubic meters of wastewater containing NH4+ were discharged from industries in China during 2013 (Li et al., 2016), and the concentration could reach 14.6 mg/L as mentioned in Qin et al. (2018).
As water pollutants have potential to cause toxic effects on aquatic biota and affect health of human, monitoring and assessment of these pollutants are more and more urgent (Ren et al., 2019a; Hu et al., 2020), and cause great interesting to researchers (Schwarzenbach et al., 2006; Gondal et al., 2009; Ren et al., 2015, 2019b; Qi et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2020). Current water quality monitoring methods are mainly divided into physical, chemical and biological monitoring methods (Wang et al., 2014; Bae and Park, 2014). Biological monitoring methods are becoming more and more importance in the risk assessment of environment contamination due to the advantages of higher selectivity, reliability, simplicity, easy operation, and strong real-time performance (Franzle 2006; Ejeian et al., 2018). Additionally, in the biological monitoring methods, various physiological responses at different levels in organisms could be analyzed. The responses of organisms could be an indicator for early detection of water pollution (Salanki et al., 2003; Ren et al., 2016a). Recent advancement in biological monitoring technology mainly includes behavior, metabolism and electrocardiogram analysis (Zhang et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2019; Ren et al., 2019c; Li et al., 2020a), in which heart electrocardiogram (ECG) could be regarded as a good and effective biomarker to assess the potential toxic effects of water-borne chemicals due to the response sensitivity of organisms to aquatic contaminants (Xing et al., 2017; Song et al., 2018; Cantanhede et al., 2020).
Zebrafish are good animal models for behavioral, biochemical, and physiological measurements (Huang et al., 2018; Poopal et al., 2020; Ramesh et al., 2020). The zebrafish heart ECG is similar to that of humans and thus zebrafish are considered as an ideal model for cardiovascular research (Fu et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2015). Zebrafish are highly sensitive to changes in their external environment (Cowart et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Ren and Liu, 2018), which is also a research basis for monitoring changes in ECG parameters to evaluate the potential toxic effects of stressors. Evaluation of zebrafish heart ECG data is now a promising technique in pharmaceutical and cardio safety research (Chaudhari et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016). It is hypothesized that a new online zebrafish heart ECG acquisition and evaluation technology could be benefit to the monitoring of aquatic contaminants, so the purpose of this research is to: 1) analyze the characteristic effects of different environmental pollutants on zebrafish ECG; 2) discuss the types of correlation between zebrafish ECG signals and pollutant doses; 3) to setup an online fish ECG data analysis technology for different environmental stressors.
