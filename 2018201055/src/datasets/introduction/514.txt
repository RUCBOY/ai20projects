Digitalization is permeating society in many ways and the role of digital technologies is only expected to increase. While digitalization comes in many forms, in recent years artificial intelligence (AI), including machine learning, has gained enormous traction. Notable application domains include transportation (autonomous cars), energy, healthcare, and manufacturing. Compared to these other fields, the use of AI in the water domain is still relatively modest.
Although AI in itself is not new (cf. Crevier, 1993), its current use and impact are unprecedented. With that, AI has also become a topic people have strong opinions about. Some present dystopian views about autonomous systems “taking control”, while others see AI as a panacea for many of today's societal challenges (Russell, 2019). While neither of these extremes seem to be constructive, with the current rise of AI techniques it is important to think about the desired role of AI in society (IEEE, 2019). Under the term “responsible AI”, many initiatives are now being launched to compile guidelines for the principles and values according to which AI is to be developed.
The aim of this paper is to present a review of current AI applications in the water domain and to develop some tentative insights on what “responsible AI” could mean there. Following a brief explanation of artificial intelligence and related terms in Section 2, Section 3 describes our review methodology. The results are presented in Section 4. This is followed by a discussion (Section 5) and concluding remarks (Section 6).
