Recent advances in wearable devices have led to the emergence of wireless body area network (WBAN), which is a network of intelligent and low power sensor devices positioned on or around the human body [1], [2]. These sensors measure and transmit the wearer’s biomedical data such as heart rate and blood pressure to medical servers via open wireless channels. WBAN has potential applications in pervasive health monitoring and emergency medical response (EMS) [2], and thus its deployment could transform healthcare delivery in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. The collected biomedical data of the patients are sensitive as these are mainly the basis for medical diagnosis [3]. However, the openness and mobility of the wireless channels make the data vulnerable to unauthorized access. Therefore, effective authentication and data privacy protection mechanisms are vital to the security of WBAN and the safety of the patients. The architecture of WBAN as depicted in Fig. 1 consists of three tiers [1], which are intra-WBAN, inter-WBAN, and beyond WBAN.
Research efforts on authentication in WBAN are based on cryptographic and non-cryptographic techniques. Cryptographic based schemes [3], [4] rely on pre-shared keys, encryption, and decryption algorithms to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the network. The strength of these schemes is that attackers have limited computational capabilities to decrypt the encryption algorithms without the secret keys. However, the devices in WBAN do not have enough resources to perform the complex computations in these schemes. Moreover, if a node is compromised, the pre-shared keys can be disclosed to the attackers. Non-cryptographic authentication methods, which use either physiological features (e.g., an electrocardiogram (ECG) [5], [6], [7], [8]) or channel characteristics [2], [9], [10], [11] have been identified as alternative approaches to authentication in WBAN. These schemes have recently attracted increasing attention due to their simple requirements, absence of pre-shared secrets, and less computation. Physiological feature based schemes are based on measuring and comparing physiological signals generated separately at a sender and a receiver. However, there has been a high rate of false alarm in these schemes because it is hard for two sensors to generate exact features with the same accuracy. Channel characteristics based schemes use the variations in the channel characteristics for authentication in WBAN. However, some of these schemes require advanced hardware [12] or extreme feature learning phase [13].Download : Download high-res image (245KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. WBAN architecture.
As a non-cryptographic approach, physiological features have been used for authentication in WBAN [14], [15]. An ECG feature and a three-party password are used in [5] to achieve authentication in intra-WBAN and inter-WBAN, respectively. The similarity of generated bio keys by two on-body devices in [6] is used to establish mutual trust in WBAN. In [7], Choi et al. proposed a practical ECG based authentication scheme using eight fiducial features from a single heartbeat. Unfortunately, the feature learning phase in their scheme consumes resources. A point generator on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and an ECG feature are used in [16] to design a hybrid authentication scheme for WBAN.
Other non-cryptographic authentication schemes in WBAN are based on channel characteristics. In [2], Shi et al. adopted K-means clustering to distinguish between the received signal strength (RSS) profiles of off-body attackers and those of on-body sensors. In [17], a unique fingerprint for user identification was generated using a distinct channel profile from a human palm. Reciprocity and spatial uncorrelation properties of a wireless channel are used in [18] to provide authentication for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In [10], Zhang and Ma proposed RSS values inconsistency removal method to ensure robust authentication and data encryption in WBAN. Unfortunately, their scheme suffers from impersonation attack and lack of mutual authentication. In [12], Liu et al. proposed an authentication scheme for WBAN based on accelerometer readings. However, continuous sampling of the accelerometer data in their scheme consumes the battery power of the devices. Mohamed and Cheffena [13] used RSS as a source of gait recognition to distinguish one person from another. In [19], Zhao et al. proposed an authentication scheme for WBAN using a biometric behavior of patients in four scenarios generated from the propagation characteristics of a wireless channel. In another scheme [20], Wang et al. utilized creeping wave propagations to secure on-body IoT devices.
Most of the existing cryptographic authentication schemes in WBAN are based on symmetric and asymmetric encryption, both of which rely on a prior security context [21], [22], [23]. In [24], [25], [26], [27], bilinear pairing based authentication schemes have been proposed for WBAN. In [3], He et al. proposed a bilinear pairing based authentication scheme. In their scheme, a client accesses services only when its access rights are verified by an application provider. To avoid the complex operations in bilinear pairing, ECC based authentication schemes [28], [29], [30], [31], [32] have been proposed for WBAN. In [4], an ECC based authentication scheme is proposed where generated identities of devices are used to establish trust. An exclusive-OR operation and a one-way hash function of a client’s identity were used in [21] to achieve anonymous mutual authentication in WBAN. In [33], Li et al. used an exclusive-OR operation and a hash function to provide anonymous mutual authentication. However, a security analysis by [6] found [33] to be vulnerable to impersonation and key escrow attacks. In [34], Xu et al. proposed a lightweight symmetric authentication scheme that ensures forward secrecy. Unfortunately, their scheme is susceptible to impersonation attack. In [35], Ma et al. proposed a zero knowledge proof (ZKP) scheme for securing intra-WBAN communication, where a receiver validates that a message originates from a sender, without either of them revealing any secret in the process. However, their scheme is susceptible to a replay attack. To address the security weakness in [35], Khernane et al. [36] proposed BANZKP, an intra-WBAN authentication scheme, which uses a commitment technique to allow one party to commit a message to the other party and reveal the secret later. However, their scheme suffers from data replay, redundant information, and distributed denial of service attacks. In [37], the authors proposed BAN-GZKP, an optimal ZKP based authentication scheme for intra-WBAN to overcome the security weaknesses in [36]. The authors demonstrated that their scheme is robust against several attacks. The summary of the available schemes in terms of their cryptographic techniques, advantages, and limitations is given in Table 1.
We can demonstrate from the above discussion that, although both the cryptographic schemes can provide authentication in WBAN, the ZKP and commitment based schemes are more preferable. This is due to their less computational complexity compared to the existing cryptographic methods in WBAN based on complex bilinear pairing [24], [25], [26], [27], ECC [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], and hash function [33], [34] operations. Moreover, the ZKP and commitment based schemes fit a WBAN setting, which requires less complex security techniques that are computationally infeasible to be broken and the devices to be able to authenticate each other without any third party intervention. However, the existing schemes have two limitations. First, our security analysis of BAN-GZKP, the latest ZKP and commitment based scheme found it to be susceptible to node compromise and impersonation attacks. Second, the existing schemes do not provide authentication and data encryption for inter-WBAN communication. When an attacker compromises the nodes in BAN-GZKP and obtains their stored secrets, the attacker can impersonate a legitimate device and initiate attacks that could endanger the lives of the patients. If inter-WBAN communication is not secured, any data leakage and node impersonation in the area could lead to meaningless subsequent security measures in the beyond WBAN area. Motivated by these limitations, we propose two hybrid authentication schemes based on ZKP, commitment technique, and channel characteristics.

(1)To address the security flaws of BAN-GZKP, we propose CIAR-ZKP, a compromise and impersonation attacks resistant (CIAR) intra-WBAN authentication scheme that exploits distinct RSS variations between on-body and off-body channels to expose attackers that have compromised nodes and attempt to impersonate them. We also conduct security and performance analyses to demonstrate the security strength of the scheme as well as its efficiency regarding complexity.(2)To ensure secure inter-WBAN communication, CCA-ZKP, a channel characteristics aware (CCA) authentication scheme is then proposed, which utilizes the reciprocity and spatial uncorrelation principles of wireless channels to distinguish between legitimate and attacker devices. Moreover, we analyze the security and performance of the scheme to demonstrate its resilience to security attacks and effectiveness in terms of resources.(3)Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on human subjects of distinct age groups to validate the effectiveness of our schemes in real-world places under different scenarios. The results indicate that our schemes are resilient to node compromise and impersonation attacks as well as effective over different subjects and environments.
