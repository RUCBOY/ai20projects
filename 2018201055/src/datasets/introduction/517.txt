Rehabilitation is the process of helping a patient recover their mental and physical abilities that they have lost due to injuries. Physical rehabilitation is essential after the neurological injuries such as stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injuries. Such injuries lead to motor impairment caused due to damage to the central and/or the peripheral nervous system that prevents voluntary limb motion. Several specialized devices with varying degrees of complexity have been developed and used for patient rehabilitation depending on the type of impairment and injuries. The rehabilitation techniques aim to evoke neuroplasticity to regain the motor functions [1]. Rehabilitation methods dealing with motor disabilities and recovery of physical abilities often utilize gaming as a means to motivate the patient. While rehabilitation is usually a difficult and boring process for the patient, the use of computer gaming can make the experience fun, and the difficulty level of the computer game can be adjusted for optimal results depending on the patient impairment level expediting the patient recovery [2], [3]. Since computer gaming usually requires coordination between the sensory inputs, the brain, and the limbs, it is one attractive method to help the patients recover their lost motor abilities as well as help with other physical impairments. Computer gaming also requires repetition of certain tasks and can thus be used as a form of exercise for the patients.
Healthcare solutions using energy harvesters have been proposed based on solar, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, thermoelectric and triboelectric technologies [4], [5], [6]. Among these the triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) has been proven to work both as a reliable self-powered sensor and energy harvester. It has been shown to sense human body motion such as joint angle or movement speed [6], [7], [8]. Such TENGs can be also used as a robot controller or an object controller in virtual space after digitizing its output [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. In order to harvest low frequency human body motion several techniques such as use of gear-train, mainsprings and multi-segmented TENGs have been employed [14], [15], [16]. Wearable TENGs used for harvesting energy from the human body can be designed in various forms depending on the application such as rotational type systems for harvesting joint motion [16], spring-based systems for harvesting body vibrations [17], or body conformable textile-based TENGs [6]. Thus TENGs can be used as sensors, the output of which when digitized can be used in control applications, and wearable TENGs can be used as energy harvesters. The energy harvested from the TENG can then be used to make the system self-powered or at the very least prolong the running time of the battery that is powering the electrical load. The use of TENGs in rehabilitation applications has been previously suggested [18], [19], [20], and especially the possibility of TENGs as sources for electrical neural stimulation has been recently studied [21], [22], [23]. However, there has as yet been no report studying the practical use of TENGs with patients having neurological or physical disabilities. Thus there is a need to explore the issues and benefits of using wearable TENGs as self-powered sensors or energy harvesters in the field of patient rehabilitation, by actually testing them on patients with significant physical impairments and undergoing rehabilitation.
In this work, we develop a non-invasive, wearable and portable TENG for the purpose of patient rehabilitation (Rehab-TENG). The developed Rehab-TENG device can operate as a self-powered sensor to operate as a game controller and communicate via Bluetooth with the game, as shown in Fig. 1a. This application was used to test the motor function skills of the patient. The Rehab-TENG device can also be used as an energy harvester where the patient can use it to charge a capacitor in an exercise system. As shown in Fig. 1b, we found that the lesser the patient impairment and greater their arm strength, the greater the energy harvested. Finally, we conducted a questionnaire survey to assess the efficacy of our Rehab-TENG device. As shown in Fig. 1c, we found that the lesser the patient impairment, the higher the scores given by the patients for motivatability and practicability of the Rehab-TENG. This implies that the patients were encouraged by the energy harvesting aspect of the Rehab-TENG and its practicability for using it in a home setting.Download : Download high-res image (486KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.
