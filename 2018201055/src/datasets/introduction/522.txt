Optical coordinate measurement is becoming popular in manufacturing due to its non-contact nature, high point density, fast data acquisition rates, and relatively high measurement accuracy. With the decreasing prices of optical hardware, such as cameras and projectors, and a large number of complex measurement demands, optical coordinate measurement is used in a number of sectors, including aerospace [1], civil engineering [2], experimental solid mechanics [3] and additive manufacturing [4].
A typical optical coordinate measurement procedure involves firmware setup, camera positioning, image acquisition, image processing, reconstruction and data analysis [5]. Although optical coordinate measurement has taken a market share in industrial inspection, the approach lacks an established and automated method for inspection planning; something that is common for contact coordinate measuring machines (CMMs) [6,7]. Camera positioning is one of the most significant issues that makes the use of optical coordinate measurement systems (CMSs) restricted to experienced operators [8]. Optimal camera positioning is critical because the selected positions affect not only the image acquisition time and post processing of the data, but also the coverage of the object surfaces and the accuracy of the measurement. Published solutions to camera positioning in optical CMSs [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12]] are often application specific and the number of cameras is given in advance.
In this paper, a novel technique is proposed for determining optimal camera positions based on a visible point analysis approach. A genetic algorithm (GA) is adopted to find the optimal combination of camera positions that results in high surface coverage of an object while minimising the total number of cameras required. GAs are inspired by the mechanism of natural selection, where the best candidates from a population of possible solutions are chosen for further crossover and mutation to obtain new successors [[13], [14], [15]]. The process of generating new populations from descendants is repeated until the new population of successors converge. Since their introduction, GAs and their variants have been used in many areas and shown to be effective for non-linear, complex global optimisation problems (for examples, see the reviews [16,17]). GAs are especially useful in poorly understood scenarios where there is no direct relationship between the input arguments and output target values, and for problems with large search spaces. Due to the complex search space when dealing with multiple cameras, GAs are promising candidates for camera position optimisation [18].
1.1. Related workOptical coordinate measurement using cameras is now widely used in advanced manufacturing [19]. The use of a single stereo-pair of cameras, is often insufficient for part inspection due to the limited field of view (FOV) and the self-occlusion of surfaces [20]. In order to increase the FOV and maximise coverage of an object's surface, a network of multiple camera viewpoints can be an effective solution [24], which can be achieved using either multiple cameras or a single camera which moves relative to the object. The approach of using multiple views extends beyond large scale form metrology and has also been applied to microscopic scales [25]. Characterisation of the intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters is critical for accurate measurement [19]. Camera calibration is a research topic in its own right and is beyond the scope of this work (for more details see Ref. [[19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]). Barazzetti points out [10] that as optical coordinate measurement, particularly photogrammetry, has become more accessible, inexperienced users with little measurement experience often produce crude reconstructions at the cost of metric accuracy. Particularly, inexperienced users are liable to capture far more images than are required with an unfavourable network geometry – this highlights the need for automated view planning.There are two main concerns when view planning for an optical measurement system: where should the camera views be placed relative to the object, and how many camera views are required to satisfy object coverage and reconstruction accuracy requirements in reasonable amount of time [26]?Carrivick et al. [26] found that tens to hundreds of images are typically required for accurate reconstruction, depending on object complexity, desired reconstruction accuracy, and reconstruction time constraints. In a multi-camera network, as the number of cameras increases, so does the computational cost and bandwidth required; therefore, many state-of-the-art systems attempt to minimise the number of cameras in the network [23].Early work in this field explored the development of the ‘configuration of sensors’ (CONSENS) system [7]; this used expert knowledge to conduct view planning from the CAD data of an object. The ‘evolving position of cameras’ (EPOCA) system [27] was developed for designing imaging networks for robotic systems. EPOCA did not rely on expert knowledge and instead used GAs to optimise the imaging network. More recently, the imaging network designer (IND) system has been developed [11]; this uses a four-step algorithm of datum definition, optimum distance calculation, viewpoint generation, and viewpoint clustering and selection. IND relies on initial object geometry, which can be obtained using a structure from motion or structured light projection technique. Other recent work [9] uses evolutionary algorithms to optimise coverage and viewpoint redundancy in a multi-sensor measurement network. Some approaches attempt to iteratively improve on a sparse initial network by adding more camera views in-situ; however, this approach requires a reasonable initial network and in-situ computation time which would hamper measurement speed. For example, Erat et al. [28] present a real-time online variant of view planning approach which accepts incoming views to the network if this view improves coverage of the scene based on a predefined coverage metric.While there has been some work in this area, it is clear that automated view planning remains an open problem for multi-view optical CMSs. There is room for development of a general approach, based on a priori knowledge of an object and the nature of the CMS, which considers both viewpoint location and total number of viewpoints in the same optimisation process.
