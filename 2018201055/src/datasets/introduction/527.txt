The study on neural networks has been an important and hotspot issue for a long time due to their great application prospects in various areas such as pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, computer science, automatic control, signal processing, and optimization  [11], [28], [31]. Generally speaking, there exists a transient time lag response between two different neurons since the signal transmission does respond immediately [6]. In order to meet the requirements in actual applications, many scholars have put up various kinds of delayed neural networks. To effectively grasp the internal law of delayed neural networks, a lot of researchers pay much attention to the various dynamical behaviors (for example, periodic solution, anti-periodic solution, almost periodic solution, pseudo almost periodic solution, weight pseudo almost periodic solution, piecewise pseudo almost periodic solution, Sp-almost periodic solution, pseudo almost automorphic solution, piecewise asymptotically almost automorphic solution, weight pseudo almost automorphic solutions, square-mean almost autorphic solution, Stepanov-like weighted pseudo almost automorphic solution, weighted pseudo anti-periodic solution, bifurcation, dissipativity, synchronization, global Mittag-Leffler stability, fixed-time stabilization, etc.) of delayed neural networks. Up to now, a great deal of interesting and meaningful results have been achieved. For example, Huang et al. [14] investigated the bifurcations for fractional-order neural networks with leakage delays. Syed Ali et al. [30] dealt with global Mittag-Leffler stability for impulsive delayed fractional-order BAM neural networks. Abdurahman and Jiang [2] considered the control technique of projective synchronization for delayed BAM neural networks. Li et al. [21] obtained a good sufficient condition to ensure the fixed-time stabilization of a class of BAM neural networks. Aouiti et al. [7] established a new sufficient criterion to guarantee the existence and global exponential stability of pseudo almost periodic solution for a class of delayed BAM neural networks. Li and Xiang [22] systematically discussed the anti-periodic solution of delayed Clifford-valued inertial Cohen–Grossberg neural networks. For more concrete works on this topic, one can see [1], [5], [20], [23], [24], [25], [34], [35], [36], [37], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44].
The generalized delayed bidirectional associative memory neural networks are described as the form: (1.1)u̇l(t)=−αlul(t)+∑m=1pamlgl(vm(t−ϑml))+Il,l=1,2,…,q,v̇m(t)=−βmvm(t)+∑l=1qblmhm(ul(t−ξlm))+Jm,m=1,2,…,p,where αl and βm describe the stability of internal neuron processes on I-layer and J-layer, respectively. aml,blm(l=1,2,…,q;m=1,2,…,p) stand for the connection weights through neurons in I-layer and J-layer; On I-layer, the neurons whose states are denoted by ul(t) receive the inputs Il and the inputs outputted by those neurons in the J-layer via activation functions gl, while on the J-layer, the neurons whose associated states are denoted by vm(t) receive the inputs Jm and the inputs outputted by those neurons in the I-layer via activation functions hm, ϑml and ξlm denote the delay of neural processing and delivery of signals (see [10], [19], [40]).
Hopf bifurcation is an important dynamical behavior of delayed neural networks. The study on Hopf bifurcation of delayed neural networks plays a vital role in designing and controlling neural networks. In particular, the effect of time delay on the stability and Hopf bifurcation properties has become the focus of research. During the past decades, many authors put in much effort to investigate the Hopf bifurcation of above delayed neural networks. Considering the complexity of the characteristic equations of high-dimensional neural networks, many scholars mainly are concerned with the Hopf bifurcation of simplified neural networks. Through the discussion on Hopf bifurcation of simplified neural networks, we can better grasp the intrinsic dynamical law of large-scale complex neural networks. For this topic, a lot of outstanding achievements have constantly been emerged. For example, Yu and Cao [45] established the following four-neuron BAM neural networks with multiple delays: (1.2)u̇1(t)=−κ1u1(t)+a11g11(v1(t−υ3))+a12g12(v2(t−υ3)),u̇2(t)=−κ2u2(t)+a21g21(v1(t−υ4))+a22g22(v2(t−σ4)),v̇1(t)=−κ3w1(t)+b11h11(u1(t−υ1))+b12h12(u2(t−υ2)),v̇2(t)=−κ4w2(t)+b21h21(u1(t−υ1))+b22h22(u2(t−υ2)).With the aid of Hopf bifurcation theory of delayed differential equations, Yu and Cao [45] analyzed the stability and Hopf bifurcation nature of system (1.2). Based on the work of Yu and Cao [45], Xu et al. [40] discussed the Hopf bifurcation of the following six-neuron BAM neural networks: (1.3)u̇1(t)=−a1u1(t)+b11g11(v1(t−υ4))+b12g12(v2(t−υ4))+b13g13(v3(t−υ4)),u̇2(t)=−a2u2(t)+b21g21(v1(t−υ5))+b22g22(v2(t−υ5))+b23g23(v3(t−υ5)),u̇3(t)=−a3u3(t)+b31g31(v1(t−υ6))+b32g32(v2(t−υ6))+b33g33(v3(t−υ6)),v̇1(t)=−a4v1(t)+b41g41(u1(t−υ1))+b42g42(u2(t−υ2))+b43g43(u3(t−υ3)),v̇2(t)=−a5v2(t)+b51g51(u1(t−υ1))+b52g52(u2(t−υ2))+b53g53(u3(t−υ3)),v̇3(t)=−a6v3(t)+b61g61(u1(t−υ1))+b62g62(u2(t−υ2))+b63g63(u3(t−υ3)).In 2014, Javidmanesh et al. [19] studied the global stability analysis and existence of periodic solutions of the following eight-neuron delayed BAM neural networks: (1.4)u̇1(t)=−α1u1(t)+β11g11(v1(t−η5))+β12g12(v2(t−η5))+β13g13(v3(t−η5))+β14g13(v4(t−η5)),u̇2(t)=−α2u2(t)+β21g21(v1(t−η6))+β22g22(v2(t−η6))+β23g23(v3(t−η6))+β24g24(v4(t−η6)),u̇3(t)=−α3u3(t)+β31g31(v1(t−η7))+β32g32(v2(t−η7))+β33g33(v3(t−η7))+β34g34(v4(t−η7)),u̇4(t)=−α4u4(t)+β41g41(v1(t−η8))+β42g42(v2(t−η8))+β43g43(v3(t−η8))+β44g44(v4(t−η8)),v̇1(t)=−α5v1(t)+β51g51(u1(t−η1))+β52g52(u2(t−η2))+β53g53(u3(t−η4))+β54g54(u4(t−η4)),v̇2(t)=−α6v2(t)+β61g61(u1(t−η1))+β62g62(u2(t−η2))+β63g63(u3(t−η4))+β64g64(u4(t−η4)),v̇3(t)=−α7v3(t)+β71g71(u1(t−η1))+β72g72(u2(t−η2))+β73g73(u3(t−η4))+β74g74(u4(t−η4)),v̇4(t)=−α8v4(t)+β81g81(u1(t−η1))+β82g82(u2(t−η2))+β83g83(u3(t−η4))+β84g84(u4(t−η4)).Javidmanesh et al. [19] obtained the sufficient condition to ensure the global existence of periodic solutions of system (1.3) and set up the sufficient criterion to guarantee the global asymptotically stability of system (1.3). It is worth remarking that all the aforementioned reports are within the scope of Hopf bifurcation of integer-order delayed differential systems. As for the Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order delayed differential systems, up to now, few fruits have been achieved due to the slow development of fractional calculus. Recently, fractional calculus has been extensively applied in many fields such as electromagnetic waves, viscoelasticity, physics, bioengineering, mechanics, neural networks and so on [17], [18]. In recent several decades, fractional calculus has attracted more and more attention from numerous researchers. Nowadays there are some publications on Hopf bifurcation of neural networks that have been reported. For example, Huang et al. [17] discussed the bifurcation behavior of delayed fractional neural networks with heterogeneous orders; Huang et al. [18] investigated the bifurcation for a fractional-order neural network with two delays. Yan [46] revealed the effect of leakage delay on stability and Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order complex-valued neural networks. Huang et al. [16] obtained a novel bifurcation result for delayed fractional-order quaternion-valued neural networks. This is a very valuable work. Xu et al. [38] made a detailed analysis on the influence of two different delays on bifurcation of fractional-order neural networks. For more related publications, see Refs. [3], [12], [13], [15].
It is worth mentioning that all the works are only concerned with the low-dimensional neural networks. When the number of neurons of neural networks increases, how is the bifurcation behavior of neural networks? So far, the work on Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order high-dimensional neural networks is very scare. In order to make up for the drawback, we think that it is necessary to focus on the Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order high-dimensional neural networks. Inspired by the analysis above and based on the previous neural network models, we establish the following fractional-order eight-neuron BAM neural networks with multiple delays: (1.5)dϱu1(t)dtϱ=−α1u1(t)+β11g11(v1(t−η5))+β12g12(v2(t−η5))+β13g13(v3(t−η5))+β14g13(v4(t−η5)),dϱu2(t)dtϱ=−α2u2(t)+β21g21(v1(t−η6))+β22g22(v2(t−η6))+β23g23(v3(t−η6))+β24g24(v4(t−η6)),dϱu3(t)dtϱ=−α3u3(t)+β31g31(v1(t−η7))+β32g32(v2(t−η7))+β33g33(v3(t−η7))+β34g34(v4(t−η7)),dϱu4(t)dtϱ=−α4u4(t)+β41g41(v1(t−η8))+β42g42(v2(t−η8))+β43g43(v3(t−η8))+β44g44(v4(t−η8)),dϱv1(t)dtϱ=−α5v1(t)+β51g51(u1(t−η1))+β52g52(u2(t−η2))+β53g53(u3(t−η4))+β54g54(u4(t−η4)),dϱv2(t)dtϱ=−α6v2(t)+β61g61(u1(t−η1))+β62g62(u2(t−η2))+β63g63(u3(t−η4))+β64g64(u4(t−η4)),dϱv3(t)dtϱ=−α7v3(t)+β71g71(u1(t−η1))+β72g72(u2(t−η2))+β73g73(u3(t−η4))+β74g74(u4(t−η4)),dϱv4(t)dtϱ=−α8v4(t)+β81g81(u1(t−η1))+β82g82(u2(t−η2))+β83g83(u3(t−η4))+β84g84(u4(t−η4)),where all the coefficients have same implications as those in model (1.1) or model (1.4) and ϱ∈(0,1] is a constant.
For a long time, a great deal of research results on Hopf bifurcation for integer-order delayed differential dynamical systems have been reported. Compared with the integer-order case, the investigation on Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order differential systems is much scarce. Up to recent several decades, the study on Hopf bifurcation of fractional-order differential systems has gradually increased. However, there are still many problems waiting for us to solve. In this paper, the main object is to seek the condition to guarantee the stability and the appearance of Hopf bifurcation and reveal the impact of time delay on the Hopf bifurcation of neural network (1.5).
In order to establish the key results of this work, we give the following hypothesis: (H1)glm∈Ci,glm(0)=0(l=1,2,…,8;m=1,2,3,4;i=1,2,3,…).
(H2)η1+η5=η2+η6=η3+η7=η4+η8=η.
The article is planned in four sections. Section 2 lists some basic knowledge on fractional calculus. Section 3 is devoted to analyzing the stability and the appearance of Hopf bifurcation for system (1.5). Section 4 carries out some numerical simulations and bifurcation diagrams to verify the feasibility of the key analytical results. Section 5 finishes this article with a conclusion.
