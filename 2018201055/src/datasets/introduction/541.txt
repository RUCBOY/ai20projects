Social media platforms have received much attention in the past decade during a crisis to get the situational updates [1], [2], [3] like dead people, availability and requirement of resources [4], [5], [6], needs of affected and injured people, etc. People post a large number of messages on social media related to the situational information [7], [8], [9] during and in the aftermath of a disaster. Along with the situational tweets, sentiment tweets (e.g., sympathies for those affected) are also posted. Some works [8], [10], [11], [12], [13] have used feature-based approaches for extracting the situational information from social media. On the other hand, some studies [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] have used either feature-based methods or deep learning methods for sentiment analysis of tweets from social media.
Damage assessment is one of the critical situational awareness steps for humanitarian organizations to understand the seriousness of the damage and provide the services to the people according to the emergency during a disaster. Existing works [10], [11], [12] focused on the damage assessment during a disaster. In [11], the authors concentrated only on damage assessment of buildings and infrastructure on Italian tweets. However, they did not focus on English tweets and also failed to address the human damage assessment from the tweets. Even though the authors in [12] used a split-query based information retrieval approach for detecting the infrastructure damage assessment during a disaster, there is no focus on the human damage assessment. However, their method requires manual selection of keywords for setting the query in the information retrieval methods. Similarly, the authors in [10] focused on damage assessment on buildings and infrastructure with the use of images but missed important information that might be available from text data. However, there is no reported work on human damage assessment either from the text or images. The human damage assessment information is beneficial to the government organizations for providing necessary services to the victims. Therefore, it is essential to detect both human and infrastructure damage assessment from the tweets during a disaster. Few example tweets related to damage and non-damage assessment tweets are explained in Table 1. The first four tweets are related to damage assessment, and the rest are related to non-damage assessment.
In this paper, we considered the identification of damage (both human and infrastructure damage) assessment tweets as a binary and multi-class classification problem. As different categorical damage information is essential during disaster, we have formulated a new approach by designing the weighted features using linear regression and SVR for both binary and multi-class classification problems, which includes features such as low-level lexical and syntactic features and highest frequency words. The experiments are performed on different classifiers to select suitable classifier for the proposed features. The selected classifier is used for experimenting on different disaster datasets, and it is evaluated by various parameters.Table 1.

The contributions of this work are summarized as follows:

1.We propose a novel method based on the low-level lexical, syntactic features and top-most frequency words that are weighted by using SVR and linear regression weighting algorithms for identifying the damage assessment tweets during a disaster. The proposed method is vocabulary independent, which allows the model to identify the tweets accurately, even the model is trained with different disaster datasets.2.We compare our proposed method with different state-of-the-art methods on various datasets. The proposedmethod has improved up to 37.12% accuracy compared with the existing methods. It achieves the best performance in identifying the damage assessment tweets for both in-domain and cross-domain in the case of binary and multi-class classification.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related work. Section 3 describes the proposed method for identifying damage assessment tweets during a disaster. The experiment results and performance analysis of the proposed method are explained in Section 4. Section 5 explains the conclusion of the paper.
