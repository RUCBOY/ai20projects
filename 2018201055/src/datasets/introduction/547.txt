Autonomous driving technology is evolving rapidly and with it, a new mixed-traffic environment in which human drivers interact with self-driving cars is arising (Kala and Warwick, 2013). This scenario requires intelligent driving systems to be able to react to an uncertain environment (Liu et al., 2020). In this context, Hubmann et al. (2018) identifies two types of uncertainties: one originating from noisy sensors and the other coming from human intentions. For noisy sensors, new technologies, such as high precision GPS and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, can help self-driving systems obtain more precise information about their surroundings. For human intentions uncertainty, some studies have been done to predict human behaviours during driving (Wang et al., 2017, Wang and Xi, 2016, Ren et al., 2017).
As widely recognized, autonomous vehicles should be able to predict the intentions of other road participants taking all the precautions in order to drive safely, yet not overreacting to threats with low probability (Wang et al., 2010, Zhan et al., 2018). When all surrounding vehicles are treated the same, the intelligent system is obliged to make very conservative decisions to reduce all possible collision risks. However, based on real-world observations, drivers are diverse and usually react differently to stimulus, which creates complex driving behaviours and profiles. As a result, understanding the underlying driving behaviours and styles of drivers becomes necessary in enabling a safe and efficient autonomous driving.
In this paper we focus on identifying different driving styles among human drivers, which is particularly important in the mixed driving environment consisting of human drivers and autonomous/self-driving vehicles. By using clustering techniques, we can find groups of drivers that share similar characteristics. In addition, to account for the fact that some driving styles may show only under specific circumstances, a dynamic clustering framework is considered. More specifically, multiple clustering analyses are done by varying the input data using different cutting points of the vehicle trajectory data. In other words, a position-dependent structure of the clusters is proposed. Such an approach has the capability to recognize the evolving behaviours of drivers. For instance, a driver that started as a more cautious type of driver may change to a more impulsive type as he goes on the road when the surrounding environment changes. This dynamic clustering approach helps represent more complex driving profiles than traditional static clustering. The US-101 dataset from the Next Generation Simulation Program (NGSIM) is used in this paper, which contains the trajectories of vehicles in the U.S. 101 Highway of Los Angeles, California — a five-lane road with one on-ramp access and one off-ramp exit (U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration, 2016). Following the exploratory analysis, we focus on drivers that take the on-ramp to access the free-way since they show a wider range of behaviours than drivers that are passing through.
The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows:
• We propose a dynamic clustering framework for driving style profiling and identification where dynamic and evolving driving styles under changing surrounding environment can be effectively captured. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to present a dynamic clustering approach to tackle the problem.
• We develop a position-dependent dynamic cluster structure where a driver is assigned to a cluster sequence rather than a single cluster. In such a way, it can not only capture the dynamic driving behaviours but also can enable a better understanding of different driving pattern switches and more complicated driving behaviours through improved interpretability.
• A comprehensive experimental study is conducted based on a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset considering different static clustering algorithms to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic clustering approach.
The paper is organized as follows: a literature review is conducted in Section 2 . In Section 3 the considered dataset and the data preprocessing are detailed. The proposed dynamic clustering based driving styles analysis framework is given in Section 4 while results are demonstrated in Section 5. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 6.
