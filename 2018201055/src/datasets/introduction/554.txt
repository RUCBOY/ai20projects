Glucose is a leading source of energy in every living organism, and the abnormal concentrations cause chronic diseases like diabetes. Approximately 463 million population has suffered from the diabetic problem which is reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) [[1], [2], [3]]. Monitoring and controlling glucose concentration is an essential for diabetic patient. The available glucose monitoring sensors utilize natural carbohydrate-binding proteins/enzymes [[4], [5], [6], [7]] and boronic acid-based molecules [[8], [9], [10], [11], [12]]. Preserving these proteins/enzymes have their challenges because these could lose their activity [13]. To resolve this problem, a new glucose selective synthetic receptor is required to develop glucose monitoring sensors and glucose carrying receptors for insulin alternative therapy [14].
Designing a glucose binding macro-molecule in an aqueous solution is a very challenging problem. Glucose structure consists of abundant hydroxyl groups, which are easily embedded into the solvent. The properties of naturally available diverse carbohydrate-binding protein such as lectins found in plants, viruses, bacteria, and animals [15,16] that help to design a glucose selective synthetic organic molecule. A low binding affinity binding site is observed at shallow pockets on the protein surface. Calixarene [17] was the first successful synthetic carbohydrate recognition molecule reported by Aoyama and his team in 1988. There was cholaphane [18], which showed slender selection in organic media. In the sandwich model, the sugar molecule is sandwiched between two molecules. Those molecules are joined with abundant polar grouped molecules for the development of macrocyclic molecule. However, these receptors yielded low associate constants and could not confirm the selectivity. Binding sites in the above receptors are codirected rather than concurrent.
It is observed from natural glucose binding proteins [15,16], calixarene [17], and cholaphane [18] synthetic receptors that glucose is bonded through hydrogen bonding, π-π, CH-π, and Vander Wal forces. These forces play a vital role in selectivity and affinity for glucose binding [[19], [20], [21], [22]]. This information is crucial for designing a novel synthetic glucose receptor. The hydrogen bonding is formed due to the presence of polar groups in the binding molecule (see Fig. 1). The other interactions, such as Vander Wal forces with carboxylate groups and π-π stacking through aromatic rings with sugar ring, are possible in binding molecule.Download : Download high-res image (101KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Glucose structure analysis for designing complementary synthetic receptors.
The abundant hydroxyl groups around the glucose produce a challenge during the design of novel synthetic glucose receptor. There is a challenge to recognize and interact with the receptor due to the surrounding solvent. X-ray crystallographic data provides vital information on polar and hydrophobic interactions in protein-carbohydrate complexes. The sugar hydroxyl groups act as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. The researchers can achieve the selectivity and affinity of the glucose binding molecule by designing the synthetic receptor with glucose complementarity. There is a convergent arrangement of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor functional groups. The hydrogen bonding is used for developing a glucose binding molecule in nonpolar organic media. The remaining structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 presents the motivation behind the development of proposed strategy. The proposed methodology is presented in Section 3. Experimental results are discussed in Section 4. The concluding remarks are drawn in section 5.
