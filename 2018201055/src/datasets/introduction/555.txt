Cloud computing is a model for delivering on-demand computational services and resources such as computing power and data storage over the Internet [1]. Cloud computing provides resources as virtual machines (VMs) on-demand to users and executes their tasks with quality of service (QoS) requirements being fulfilled. Virtualization technology improves energy efficiency in data center by reducing the number of hardware in use and increase the utilization of resources by loading more than one virtual machine (VM) on a physical host (PH). Cloud provider needs to schedule users’ tasks into VMs and carefully place these VMs to physical hosts (PHs) in a way that both providers’ and the users’ objectives would be optimized.
Cloud computing utilizes data center infrastructures to provide services, thus the concept of cloud data centers. It is predicted that by 2021, 94% of workloads will be managed by cloud data centers [2]. In a cloud data center, service provisioing may be undertaken through two levels: (i) The first level is the task scheduling [3]; in this level each user’s task is mapped onto suitable VM. When users’ tasks need to be scheduled, users usually enter a service level agreement (SLA) with cloud provider. SLA is a contract between user and cloud provider on the expected service quality. In the SLA, the QoS requirements of the users should be clearly defined such as, the deadline of each task, budget, and service security level. Each cloud user has to decide which and how many VMs need to be used before actually requesting and paying for the service. Hence, tasks scheduling directly affects the performance of cloud computing since inefficient tasks scheduling can lead to revenue loss, performance degradation and SLA violation. (ii) The second level is the VM placement [4]. VMs need to be placed in PHs that are capable of providing the required resources (i.e., processor, memory, and disk space). Therefore, the optimal VM placement plays an important role in improving resource utilization in a cloud computing environment.
The two levels are connected via VMs. VMs are the form of objects for mapping users’ tasks to PHs. The major users’ aim is to find PHs for their tasks. On the other hand, providers’ aim is to utilize their infrastructure by accommodating tasks for users. Therefore, task scheduling and VM placement problems are basically coupled with each other.
Task scheduling in cloud computing can be modeled as a bin-packing problem and is a non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) problem [5], [6]. This problem becomes more challenging with the increasing complexity of cloud computing environment. Generally, it is difficult to develop algorithms to produce optimal solutions to task scheduling and VM placement in cloud computing. Recently, using metaheuristic algorithms to deal with task scheduling and VM placement has received increasing attention due to the ability of the algorithms to provide near-optimal solutions within a reasonable time [7].
Previous work in this area mostly dealt with task scheduling such as [8] or VM placement such as [9], [10], [11], [12] as a separate problem. However, the two problems need to be addressed together and integrated in order to produce an efficient solutions for both cloud users and providers.
In this article we investigate the research question:“to what extent joint task scheduling and VM placement can increase the performance in terms of execution cost, makespan, degree of imbalance and resource utilization.” To answer the research question, task scheduling and VM placement are integrated and modeled as one co-optimization problem, called joint task scheduling and VM placement (JTSVMP). Metaheuristic optimization algorithms (MOA) are then used to solve this integration co-optimization problem and plan a schedule defining not only the task to VM mapping but also the VM to PH mapping. Integrating VM placement with task scheduling is complicated under the task-VM-PH process, which consists of three sub-problems:

(i)Which VM should be selected for a task?(ii)Which PH should be selected for a VM?(iii)How to simultaneously integrate the VM-PH placement with task-VM scheduling?
In summary, the key contributions of this article are as follows:

(i)Integration of task scheduling and VM placement as one co-optimization problem to produce better optimization of resource utilization in cloud data center. Specifically, the relationship between task, VM and PH is considered and the one-tier processes (i.e., task-VM and VM-PH) are integrated to a two-tier process (i.e., task-VM-PH).(ii)Developing of MOA for joint task scheduling and VM placement under the two-tier process (i.e., task-VM-PH). The proposed algorithm aims to simultaneously optimize the execution cost while meeting the deadline constraint when scheduling tasks to VMs, and to optimize the resource utilization of PHs when placing the VMs in PHs.(iii)Performance evaluation of the proposed method for JTSVMP through simulations. We compare the performances of two different scenarios, i.e., task scheduling algorithms only and integration co-optimization of task scheduling and VM placement using MOAs, namely the basic glowworm swarm optimization (GSO), moth-flame glowworm swarm optimization (MFGSO) and genetic algorithm (GA). Simulation results show that optimizing joint task scheduling and VM placement leads to better overall results in terms of minimizing execution cost, makespan and degree of imbalance (DoI) and maximizing PHs resource utilization.(iv)Statistical validation of the obtained results against that of GSO, MFGSO and GA using significance test. We use Wilcoxons rank-sum test.
