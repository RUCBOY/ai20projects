Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with a sp2 hybridized geometry, including the single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs), process the highly symmetric structure and extremely small size, which allow for remarkable quantum effects and electronic, magnetic and lattice properties of CNTs. Since the discovery in 1991 by Iijima [1], both the covalent and noncovalent functionalization of CNTs have continued to be at the forefront of research activities over the world in order to explore their potential applications in many fields of high technology, such as optoelectronics, electronics, optics and biology [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Unlike [60]fullerene, although organic functional species or groups can be theoretically of addition to the π-conjugated skeleton of CNTs, very reactive reagents are required. Compared with covalent functionalization of CNTs, the solution mixing approach to prepare noncovalently modified CNTs is very simple. A typical preparation procedure for this issue usually involves mixing CNTs dispersions with dispersions of inorganic chemicals or solutions of the organic compounds/polymers and then evaporating the solvents in a controlled way. However, non-covalent modification of CNTs usually leads to phase separation, especially at high loadings. A convenient route to restrain phase separation is linking a soluble polymer as donor and CNTs as acceptor via a covalent bond.
As an emerging information storage technology, resistive random access memory (RRAM), which can be tightly integrated with the microprocessor in the same chip to lower the access latency and shorten the inter-level vias path, have demonstrated great potential for in-memory computing systems with greatly enhanced computation capability [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]. Pradhan et al. are the first to observe large conductance switching and electrical bistability in functionalized CNT-doped conjugated polymer composites at room temperature [20]. The as-prepared electronic device showed RRAM effect under “write-read-erase-read” voltage sequence. Liu and his coworkers fabricated the ITO/CNT-doped poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (CNT/PVK)/Al device that exhibits unique electrical behaviors, including insulator behavior, bistable electrical conductance switching effects and conductor behavior as well, depending on the CNT content in PVK matrix [21]. The achieved ON/OFF current ratio is in excess of 103. By using B- and N-doped carbon nanotubes (BCNTs and NCNTs) with controlled work functions as charge trap materials, the as-fabricated electronic device with a configuration of Al/BCNTs-doped polystyrene (or, NCNTs-doped polystyrene)/Al exhibited a typical RRAM performance, with an ON/OFF current ration of more than 102 and a retention time of longer than 105s [22]. Charge trapping materials with different energy levels offer a novel design scheme for solution processable multilevel memory.
With the development of memory devices with high density, ultrafast switching, and high energy efficiency, long life time, and ease of operation characteristics, a strong demand has been raised for the lightweight, wearable and flexible electronic devices (e.g., wearable computers, paper-like E-readers and epidermal electronics) [23], [24]. Large-scale flexible electronics can usually be achieved by integrating memory cells onto physically bendable and stretchable substrates. In this work, as shown in Scheme 1, we designed and synthesized novel MWNTs covalently functionalized with poly[(1,4-diethynyl- benzene)-alt-9,9-bis(4-diphenylamino-phenyl)fluorene] (hereafter abbreviated as PDDF-g-MWNTs) first and then fabricated a flexible memory device with configuration of Al/PDDF-g- MWNTs/ITO-coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). This device showed a typical rewritable RRAM performance, with a turn-on voltage of 2.07 V, a turn-off voltage of −2.45 V, and an ON/OFF current ratio exceeding 104. The memory performance of this flexible device remains almost unchanged under the stretching strain and bending test, suggesting that PDDF-g- MWNTs is one of the ideal memory materials for high-performance flexible RRAM devices.Download : Download high-res image (242KB)Download : Download full-size imageScheme 1.
