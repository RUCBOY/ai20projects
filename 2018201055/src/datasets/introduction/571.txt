Web has become the main vehicle for people to complete such as shopping, study and work. According to Mary Meeker’s 2019 Internet trends report released in the United States, the global Internet users have exceeded 3.8 billion [1]. The statistics from iResearch show that in the second quarter of 2019, China’s third-party mobile payment transactions reached 55 trillion Yuan, with a growth of 22.6% year on year [2]. However, the web transaction security problem is increasingly highlighted at the same time. Web transaction fraud has seriously threatened the transaction security of normal users [3], [4]. At the same time of the convenience brought by the use of online trading, the trading environment of Internet users needs to be further improved. In order to improve users’ trading security environment and ensure the reliable operation of online trading system, most existing researches focus on two aspects: 1) to improve web transaction security system or design new network architecture, such as [5], [6], [7], [8]. 2) to monitor web trading system, such as [9], [10], [11], [12]. However, it is difficult to improve system security only from the perspective of payment and electronic transaction system design. Study from the perspective of user behaviors is also need. There are three main forms of user authentication, i.e., three-factor [13]: something the user knows, something the user has, and something the user is. The first one user knows is like account/password, while the second is like credit card. Then the third one based on biological characteristics is widely used. Biological features include two aspects: physical and behavioral characteristics [14]. Compared with biological characteristics, behavioral characteristics are called the second generation of biological features [15]. Due to its uniqueness and non-copyable, it can be used to identify the personal credibility of authenticated users [16], [17], [18]. The creditability authentication of web users is mainly based on their individual behaviors. In fact, any authentication system has its limitations due to a particular application scenario [19]. So mobile terminal behavior authentication method can be used as the supplementary authentication in place of other identification systems. Mobile terminal behavior refers to the behavioral data obtained by recording every sensor data in the process of a user using mobile phone. Thanks to built-in GPS, gyroscope, accelerator and magnetometer modules, researchers can collect a user’s multi-type behavior data in the real world. In this paper, mobile terminal behavior is in the form of a multivariable real-valued sequence. Then, the user’s mobile terminal behavior is modeled by analyzing these trajectory characteristics. At present, mobile terminal positioning analysis mainly includes: mobile trajectory data mining method [20], mobile trajectory extensibility modeling and analysis [21], mobile user behavior mode [22], timing positioning information based on user path planning [23]. And [24] propose a RNN based method to mine human mobility pattern – Trajectory-User Linking to identify users of location-based trajectories. Despite the randomness of users’ mobile behaviors, the predictability of users’ mobile behaviors can reach 93% without great changes [25]. De Montjoye et al. [26] use mobile behavior and offline data of bank card and credit card data to locate user identity. When a user uses a mobile phone, multiple sensors continuously generate numerical behavior data sequences with a certain sampling frequency. Multiple sequences of numerical record reflect the user’s mobile phone behavior from different sides. However, the current research on mobile terminal behavior mainly focuses on single sensor’s sequential data (such as GPS sensor). There are few ways to model user behavior jointly with multiple sensors. In our previous work [27], [28], we analyzed the data of gyroscope and acceleration module together based on statistical characteristic, but ignored the information contained in behavior sequence, which reduced the accuracy of user behavior modeling. The the simultaneous analysis of sequence modeling and trusted authentication needs to be further studied. Therefore, this paper analyzes the sequential data of multiple sensors simultaneously. First, we formalize user behavior as a multivariate numerical sequence. The the multivariate real number sequence is transformed into univariate real number sequence by analyzing the correlation of multiple sequences. After that, we can model and authenticate the behavior of mobile users. Finally, the validity of the method is verified by analyzing the experimental data. More precisely, the contributions of this paper include: 
1)According to the characteristics of mobile terminal behavior, we propose a multivariable numerical sequence analysis method. First, we formalize the mobile terminal data recorded by multiple sensors into a multi-variable sequence. Then we propose a sliding-window dimension reduction method based on subspace monitoring by analyzing the correlation between multiple sequence data points.2)We use these dimension reduction data to conduct behavior authentication analysis based on Gaussian process authentication. Based on subspace reduction and Gaussian process authentication, the trusted authentication of multivariable sequences is realized. Then we conduct a series of experiments to illustrate the efficiency of our method.
