Matrix decompositions have a wide range of applications in many scientific fields [1], [2], [3], [4]. Schur decomposition (SD), which is a branch of matrix decompositions, plays an important role in different science and engineering fields, such as digital audio watermarking scheme [5], model reduction [6], noise suppression [7], and dimensionality reduction [8]. SD-based techniques are effective in solving various engineering problems [9], [10]. Many methods and algorithms were proposed to accelerate SD. For example, in [11], an SD formula for row (column) extended matrix was derived to enhance the accuracy and ease of calculation. In [12], an SD algorithm based on parallel computation was presented.
However, the previous research on SD mostly focuses on static (i.e., time-invariant) matrices, because analyzing time-varying ones is complex and difficult [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. The common approach for solving the time-varying SD problem, or time-varying matrix problems in general, is considering the matrix as multiple independent static matrices [21]. However, if the calculation is highly complex or the calculation ability of the computer is not sufficiently strong, obtaining a real-time solution using the traditional method is difficult or even impossible. The objective of this study is to propose a continuous-time SD model to solve the time-varying SD problem in real time.
Zhang neural dynamics (ZND) is an effective method for solving various time-varying problems. Models based on the ZND method can achieve good convergence performance [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], and the convergence speed can be controlled by adjusting the design parameter [27], [28], [29], [30], [31]. Thus, we utilize ZND method to design the continuous-time SD model.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the time-varying SD problem is discussed and converted into another form. The design processes of the continuous-time SD model are presented in Section 3, and two corresponding theorems are presented. In Section 4, three examples with different dimensions are introduced and investigated. The numerical results are then discussed to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model. Finally, Section 5 provides the conclusion. The main contributions of this study are listed as follows.
1.The SD problem of a time-varying matrix is analyzed, and the corresponding error functions are defined.2.A continuous-time SD model is presented and investigated using the ZND method.3.Three examples with different dimensions are solved using the proposed model, and the numerical experimental results verify its effectiveness.
