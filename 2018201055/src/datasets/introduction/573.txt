With the rapid development of mobile communication technologies, many people are used to using mobile devices to connect to the Internet, and use social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Weibo to express their opinions and communicate with their friends. Therefore, a large amount of attention from academic and industrial societies has been paid to the studies on social networks [1], [2], [3]. Noting that information can be forwarded along the relationships in a social network, which may incur a chain reaction, researchers call this phenomenon word-of-mouth effect [4]. Some advertisers start to deploy advertisements in popular social networks, and hope to spread them to a large number of users, which is regarded as viral marketing [5], [6]. An important issue here is to understand the diffusion dynamics and then rank users according to their influences [7], [8], [9]. This information will be useful for an advertiser to decide how to deploy an advertisement.
Many efforts have been devoted to the research of diffusion dynamics in the area of epidemiology, and researchers usually use the Susceptible–Infectious–Susceptible (SIS) model and Susceptible–Infectious–Removed (SIR) model [10], [11] to investigate the diffusion dynamics. An interesting phenomenon here is the existence of epidemic threshold, above which the epidemic may spread and never terminate. There are some studies which consider the impact of network structure on the epidemic threshold [12], [13], [14], [15]. However, the diffusion process in social networks is very different from that in epidemiology, and cannot be characterized by these models accurately. Two famous models in the research of social networks are independent cascade model [16], [17] and linear threshold model [18]. In the former one, an active node tries to influence its inactive neighbors with given probabilities, and these influence behaviors are independent. In the latter one, each node is assigned with a weight, and an inactive node will be influenced if the sum of its active neighbors’ weights is larger than a given threshold. Based on these models, many studies focus on the problem of influence maximization in social networks [19], [20], [21], [22], [23].
A fundamental problem in influence maximization is to evaluate the function σ(S), which is the expected number of activated users with S being the seed set. However, it has been proved that computing σ(S) is #P-hard in both independent cascade model and linear threshold model [24], [25]. To overcome the #P-hardness, Kempe et al. [19] use Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate σ(S). Unfortunately, this approach needs to generate a large amount of samples to get a good estimation for σ(S), which leads to tremendous computational costs. Leskovec et al. [26] propose an early termination heuristic to prune nodes with small influences at subsequent iterations to reduce the number of simulations. Goyal et al. [27] improve the work [26] by avoiding unnecessary simulations, but fail to achieve significant speedups [28]. Zhou et al. [29] use matrix analysis to get an upper bound of influence quickly, and then receive better performance compared with [26] and [27]. Although considerable efforts have been devoted to accelerate the simulation process of estimating σ(S), significant computational costs are still required, which has been reported by [28] and [30].
In this paper, we introduce a duplicate forwarding model to characterize the diffusion process in social networks, where messages are forwarded in an all-or-none way and a user can forward multiple messages to a given neighbor. Although there are some differences between the independent cascade model and the duplicate forwarding model, we show that the user influence rankings in these two models are highly positively correlated, and an influential user in one model is very likely to be influential in the other one. Specifically, we adopt generating function [31] to analyze the user influence in the duplicate forwarding model theoretically, and estimate the user influence rankings below and above the diffusion threshold respectively. Besides, we choose 4 real-world networks, and conduct simulations to estimate the user influence ranking in the independent cascade model. We propose a Spearman-like correlation coefficient to measure the correlation between two rankings, and study the accuracies of using the results from the duplicate forwarding model, degree, betweenness [32], k-core [33] and PageRank [34] to estimate the user influence ranking in the independent cascade model. We find that the duplicate forwarding model achieves the best accuracy.
In our view, the analysis framework and results in this paper are of use to model and estimate the user influence in social networks, and can provide help in solving the influence maximization problem. Note that we can apply this approach to rank seed sets according to their influences, i.e. σ(⋅). For example, given seed sets S1,S2,…, we can add a user si for Si in the network, and add directed edges with influence probability 1 from si to v, where v∈Si. Then we get a new network, and can estimate the user influence ranking for s1,s2,…, which is actually the influence ranking for the seed sets S1,S2,… in the original network.
