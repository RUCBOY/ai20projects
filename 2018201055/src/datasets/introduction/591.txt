Today network information security is facing a severe test. Image information security is an important part of network information security research and attracts much attention. And image encryption technology is one of the most effective means of image information security. Image cryptography falls into symmetric cryptography and block cipher technology [6], [9]. Image cryptosystem generally includes two parts, key expansion and image information transformation. The key expansion generates pseudo-random sequences (i.e. equivalent keys) from the secret key for image information transformation [21], [28]. The image information transformation transforms the positions and values of image pixels via the equivalent keys using confusion and diffusion methods [2], [10], [11], [17], [39].
Chaotic system is the core of key expansion algorithm. Two forms of secret keys are commonly used in the key expansion. One is the external key in byte form. This key will be preprocessed by bit operation and numerical system transformation to convert into the initial state values of chaotic system. They are then substituted into the chaotic system to iteratively generate a sequence of chaotic states, which are further transformed into the equivalent keys through rounding operation [4], [20], [32]. The other is the direct key in floating form. This key is directly composed of initial values or parameters of chaotic system. Thus the key can immediately drive the chaotic system to produce the equivalent keys [12], [24], [40].
Image information transformation includes two algorithms, confusion and diffusion. The commonly used confusion algorithms are sorting scrambling [29], matrix transformation based on cat map [22], random walk algorithm [41], permutation based on bit level [15] and so on. The confusion is characterized by disturbing the positions of image pixels without changing their values. The familiar diffusion algorithms include sequential XOR or modular addition operation of adjacent pixels [45], filter-based algorithm [27], bit-layer-based algorithm [34], cyclic shift-based algorithm [7], and linear transformation-based algorithm [44], etc. These algorithms employ the equivalent keys to disperse the information of each pixel to other pixels in the entire image to achieve the purpose of image information hiding.
The two parts, chaotic system based key expansion and image information transformation, are combined to get the so-called image cryptographic algorithm based on chaotic system [8], [26], [33]. With the development of image encryption algorithms, image cryptanalysis technology has also made great progress. Since an analysis method of image cryptosystem was proposed in 1996 [18], a variety of image cryptosystems have been found to be insecure.
First, the work of Chang et al. [5] suggested that the methods of transforming images using different scan patterns cannot frustrate the chosen plaintext attack. The SCAN language based on tree and graph can quickly scramble image bit information. Bit based scrambling has diffusion effect at byte level, but it cannot resist bit based differential attack. Moreover, the SCAN language doesn’t work for some special images. These discoveries ended the early era of widely used SCAN language for image encryption [30].
Secondly, the works in [19], [25] proved that the confusion-only image cryptosystems are insecure. Such systems are weak when confronting with the chosen/known plaintext attacks. A threshold value is presented in [25] and more than the value of plain-cipher image pairs definitely decipher the confusion-only systems. Their efforts terminate the era of image encryption systems with only confusion algorithms.
Thirdly, the chosen/known plaintext attacks are now widely used in image cryptographic analysis [23], [35], [42], [49]. Many image cryptosystems have obvious defects and fail to resist the chosen/known plaintext attacks [14], [36], [37], [43]. For example, some image cryptosystems cannot fight against the differential analysis due to their equivalent keys being unrelated to plain image [14], [36]; others have weak schemes resulting in low encryption strength for some pixels [37], [43].
In addition to the above insecure factors, image cryptosystems based on chaotic system face two major problems:

(i)The domain of secret key is vaguely defined. Since there is no definite way to define the initial state interval of two- or higher-dimensional chaotic systems, the existing method is to take a subset of the possible state space of chaotic systems as the initial state interval, i.e. the domain of secret key. This method is neither rigorous nor scientific. In this case, the key space is approximate for both the external key in integer form and the floating-point key directly used as the initial values of chaotic system [1].(ii)The speed of image encryption/decryption is not clearly standardized. Practice has shown that it is easy to design an image cryptosystem with high security but low speed. Due to the different software and hardware conditions of cryptographers, there are no standard methods to compare the encryption/decryption speed of different image cryptosystems. It is known that some image cryptosystems are much slower than AES for image encryption [46]. To meet the real-time requirement of network communications, it is an urgent need to design a fast image cryptosystem with high encryption/decryption speed measured by popular methods.
In view of the above insecure factors and major problems, a new unified image cryptosystem using lifting-like transformation based on the image cryptosystems in [47], [48] is proposed in this paper. This research work has the following highlights:
An algorithm for determining the initial value domain of Hénon map is proposed;
(i)A step-by-step iterative algorithm to generate the equivalent keys with the secret key using Hénon map is presented;(ii)An image cryptosystem with exactly the same encryption and decryption processes is suggested based on the lifting-like transformation in GF(28) field;(iii)The equivalent keys used are only half the size of the image.
The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 describes the lifting-like scheme; Section 3 introduces the unified image cryptosystem; Section 4 gives the simulation results of the unified image cryptosystem; Section 5 analyzes the statistical characteristics of ciphered images; Section 6 makes a comparative analysis of security performance; Section 7 discusses some extended work; Section 8 concludes the paper.
