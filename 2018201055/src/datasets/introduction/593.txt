Industrial robots are designed to be very robust and can withstand many years of uninterrupted operation. However, like any mechanical element working in contact with another mechanical element, an industrial robot will eventually deteriorate regardless of its design [1]. This deterioration process can last for years but once it begins to occur, it can quickly evolve to an irreversible failure. A large body of literature has been devoted to the development of Prognosis and Health Management (PHM) technologies of the individual components comprising industrial robots, such as gearboxes [2], [3] or electric motors [4], [5]. Samanta et al. [6] presented a system to monitor and predict machine conditions using soft computing techniques and a neuro-fuzzy system. They considered five different component faults to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution: gear wear, gear tooth chipping, gear tooth crack, gear pitting and shaft misalignment. In contrast, the assessment of the health status at the system level has hitherto remained being an unexplored research challenge [7]. Noticeably, the modelling of a robot joint comprises still a hard endeavour. Considering the non-linear behaviour of elastic-plastic friction interaction between rigid components, which are strongly dependent on inertial and acceleration dynamics, makes numerical exploration of health monitoring in robots extremely complicated, even when clustered computational resources are utilized [8]. In the light of this complexity, often the mathematical analyses used to estimate the degradation level of these components rely on a simplified dynamic modeling of the real problem, such as assuming constant speeds of operation [9], ignoring the temperature of the system [10], simplifying the effect of the friction [11], etc. All in all, these assumptions make the results of the models differ from reality. With this regards, there is a critical need to develop new methodologies to explore the deterioration of an industrial robot, considering the entire mechanical system, regardless of the mechanical status of a particular component comprising the robot [7]. This rapidly emerging research field can pave the way to enhance the precision and monitor the degradation of heavy load handling industrial robots, such as the ones used in the automotive and aerospace industry [7].
In recent years, there have been several approaches to address this problem. Physics-based simulation models and digital twins have been proposed in [12], [13] for industrial robot predictive maintenance and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation. Luo et al. [14] proposed a hybrid approach based on a model-based digital twin and a data-based digital twin. They proved the feasibility of the hybrid digital twin approach in a cutting tool life prediction use case. Data-driven approaches have been increasingly used for condition monitoring and predictive maintenance of industrial robots. Kokkalis et al. [15] and Papanastasiou et al. [16] monitored the torque and the current in robot joints for collision detection and human-robot collaboration. Former studies used accelerometers to identify the degradation of an industrial robot [17], [18], [19]. In [20] a laser tracker was used to identify the pose of the robot end-effector and then control its deviation. The technique called Visuo-Motor Control was used in [21] to control an industrial robot by acting on robot’s motors depending on the deviation of the end-effector. Instead of using a laser tracker, they used a camera-based vision system. In their work, as well as in the ones carried out by Quiao et al. in [22], [23] the researchers used two cameras to obtain the coordinates of the end-effector.
Vision based technologies have been widely used to improve robotic systems in manufacturing processes. Recently, a vision-based methodology was proposed in [24] and implemented alongside machine learning classification models in [25] to handle randomly placed complex parts. Stereo cameras were used in [26] to correct the path of industrial robots in welding operations. Xu et al. [27] further improved the precision of image processing in seam tracking and carried out a systematic study of the application of computer vision technology in robotic GTAW and GMAW. Tsai et al. [28] constructed a vision-based path planning method for a golf club head robotic welding system.
The vision-based solutions for industrial robots proposed so far, have been mainly focused on product quality and process improvement. This manuscript aims to cover the gap in the implementation of vision-based techniques and machine learning models for industrial robot health assessment. In this work, we present a novel approach in which we study the feasibility of using fiducial marker based vision systems to assess the accuracy degradation and repeatability of an industrial robot at different loads. We trained five supervised learning regression models to predict the deviation of the robot’s end-effector using the data provided by monocular cameras. After training the models, we tested their prediction accuracy using that data provided by both cameras.
The manuscript is structured as follows: in the next section we describe the used materials, the experimental setup and the procedure followed. Section 3 presents the obtained results and we conclude with a brief discussion and a summary of the contributions in Section 4. Finally, we identify the future lines of work in 5.
