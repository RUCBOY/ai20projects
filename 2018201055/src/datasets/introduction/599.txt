Despite the emerging advancements in technologies, Fungi is still a serious threat to human health. According to a report, every year 1.4 million deaths are caused due to the infections of fungal species like Pneumocystis, Candida, and Aspergillus [1]. Moreover, it also affects precious crops that cause huge losses [2,3]. With the escalation of immunocompromised patients, the fungal infections rapidly increased, where, the drugs used against fungal infections cause several problems like toxic side-effects, confrontational drug reactions, and ecological pollution [4,5]. To deal with these limitations, the production of novel and effective antifungal drugs is highly indispensable. In this connection, the researchers investigated peptide-based therapeutics. These therapeutics are more effective and safer than conventional methods and many peptide resources were established [[6], [7], [8]]. Major peptide-based therapeutics depends on antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs comprises of several classes including antifungal, antibacterial, antiparasitic, and antiviral, etc. In the last decades, scientists made extensive efforts and design more than 2300 novel AMPs [9]. Among these AMPs, more than 100 peptide-based drugs have been designed although about 600 drugs are under the preclinical process. AMPs with antifungal properties, i.e., antifungal peptides (AFPs), have emerged as powerful candidates due to their efficacy and high selectivity [10]. However, AMPs for fungal treatment are not effective due to a lack of its specificity. More importantly, the existing drugs such as Terbinafine, Voriconazole, Itraconazole, Fluconazole, and Posaconazole, etc. are antibiotic-resistant for antifungal infections that cause millions of death each year [11]. Thus, it is essential to develop AFPs for fungal infection medication. AFPs have many unique characteristics like high selectivity, broad activity, minor microbial resistance, and rapid action [12]. Therefore, AFPs attracted many researchers to utilize it as antibiotics alternative, in the production of drug as well as in the agriculture field [13].
Many methods have been established for the identification of different biopeptides such as antimicrobial peptides [[14], [15], [16]], antibacterial peptides [17], anticancer peptides [[18], [19], [20]], and cell-penetrating peptides [[21], [22], [23]]. However, few predictors have been reported for AFPs prediction. For instance, Joseph et al. proposed the ClassAMP method that can identify Antifungal, Antiviral, and Antibacterial [24]. In addition, Mousavizadegan et al. used machine learning algorithms to discriminate AFPs from AMPs considering AFPs as a positive subset and AMPs as a negative subset [25]. Whereas the pseudo amino acid composition was used to extract features, and a support vector machine (SVM) was utilized to train the model. Concurrently, Agrawal et al. proposed a model using amino acid residue for the prediction of AFPs using SVM. They designed a standalone software that is freely available for the convenience of the users. Besides the classical machine learning algorithms, recently deep neural networks (DNN) have attracted the attention of researchers due to their superior performance [[26], [27], [28]]. Therefore, Fang et al. developed a deep learning-based protocol, called AFPDeep for AFPs identification. Where the embedding layer and dense vector representation were adapted for automatically encoding the primary sequences. The local clues were captured by the convolutional neural network and long short term memory. Finally, AFPs prediction was performed using an ensemble neural network framework by hybridizing all the above-mentioned layers [12].
DNN is considered more effective over traditional learners due to its automatic feature encoding ability without human involvement [29]. Moreover, the DNN scale effectively with large training data as compare to classical learning algorithms [30,31]. It has been described in the series of recent publications [[32], [33], [34]], that DNN models using large datasets exhibits better performance results than classical learning methods to solve complex problems. However, recent computational models such as; iRSpot-SPI [35], 2L-piRNADNN [36], and iPredCNC [37] shows that DNN performed remarkably better using smaller datasets. Therefore, keeping the significance of DNN over the small dataset, we proposed an effective and reliable model for accurate prediction of AFPs.
After investigating the existing models in the literature, it was found that existing models used traditional methods such as Pseudo amino acid (PseAAC), Amino acid composition (AAC), and Dipeptide composition (DPC) to formulate peptide sequences. However, there were several flaws while processing short peptide sequences. i.e., in small peptide sequences, the performance of PseAAC may affect due to the high tier values because some of the useful amino acid residues may be skipped. Similarly, AAC and DPC only measure the frequency of the amino acid residues without calculating the sequence order information. On the other hand, the existing models utilized the traditional classifiers to evaluate the performance of the extracted feature spaces. Nonetheless, the performance of the aforementioned existing models is not adequate and needs more improvement. Therefore, to effectively deals with such issues, an accurate and computationally efficient classification model is proposed for antifungal peptides. To extract salient, and discriminative features, the Reduce amino acid alphabet (RAAA), quasi sequence order (QSO), and Composite physiochemical properties (CPP) are utilized. Furthermore, a hybrid feature strategy is utilized to compensate for the weakness of individual feature extraction methods. On the other hand, to examine the success rate, several hypothesis learners such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probabilistic neural network (PNN), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and deep neural network (DNN) are utilized to select the best operational engine for the proposed model.
