Secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) represent a large superfamily of interfacial enzymes with different physiological functions and tissue distribution patterns, unified by their ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of the ester bond at the sn-2 position of phospholipids in membranes [1]. sPLA2s are water-soluble enzymes that must bind to the membrane interface to gain access to their highly water-insoluble phospholipid substrates [2]. Surface of the enzyme that contacts the phospholipid surface is referred to as its interfacial binding surface (IBS). The substrate specificity of sPLA2s refers to the type of membrane interface the enzyme prefers to bind to (interfacial specificity) and the type of phospholipid accommodated in the catalytic site (catalytic site specificity).
Studying interfacial enzymes acting directly on the membrane surface requires rather sophisticated methods and experimental setups [3,4], which often leads to controversial results. When a set of sPLA2s was compared in terms of the preference for polyunsaturated versus saturated sn-2 fatty acyl chains of a phospholipid inserted in a POPG bilayer, no significant difference was observed [5]. As for the effect of lipid head groups on the hydrolysis kinetics, formation of the reaction product (reaction rate) was dependent on the charge of lipids: reaction with anionic POPG and POPS liposomes started immediately after the addition of all sPLA2s studied, but with the neutral POPC liposomes, a lag-phase at the beginning of hydrolysis was registered for some of the sPLA2s [5]. Lag-phase occurrence correlated with the absence of a tryptophan residue on the membrane binding surface: sPLAs lacking tryptophan in their IBS hydrolyzed PC vesicles after a lag-phase (up to 8 min) [5,6]. The hydrolysis kinetics of a PC membrane becomes even more complicated when the bilayer is in the gel-phase state [7,8]. For DPPC liposomes, sPLA2 from Eastern cottonmouth snake venom, group II, first bound to the vesicles, then after 4–6 min of lag reaction the product appeared, and the course of hydrolysis consisted of multiple phases of acceleration and deceleration. This finding suggested that there should be a relatively inactive, membrane-bound state for sPLA2 and the fluctuations in catalytic rate may be due to product-induced changes in membrane properties [7]. With the help of pyrene fatty acid derivative, Burack et al. [9] showed that lateral rearrangement of lipids begins prior to and continues during the rapid activation of hydrolysis process of sPLA2. Lateral phase separation, compositional heterogeneity, membrane curvature, and dynamic fluctuations of lipid packing were also shown to modulate sPLA2 activity toward bilayer substrates [[9], [10], [11]].
For many sPLA2s, electrostatic interactions involving basic amino acids have been shown to play an important role in high-affinity binding to anionic vesicles [2,12]. Meanwhile, hydrophobic interactions contribute considerably to the relatively high affinity of a number of sPLA2s with respect to zwitterionic membranes [[13], [14], [15], [16]]. Differential roles of ionic, aliphatic, and aromatic residues in membrane–protein interactions for a set of sPLA2s and C2 domain of cytosolic PLA2 were investigated with surface plasmon resonance [17]. Cationic residues of sPLA2s were shown to mainly contribute to the membrane association step through non-specific interaction with anionic membrane surfaces, whereas aromatic residues played more complex roles in interfacial binding, influencing both association and dissociation constants [17].
sPLA2 interaction with the bilayer surface influences the enzyme hydrolytic activity. Despite many crystal structures solved for the sPLA2 enzymes (e.g. [[18], [19], [20]]) and catalytic mechanisms proposed [21,22], the details of how the protein interacts with bilayers remain a subject of intensive research. The recent progress in computer aided molecular simulations allowed for additional information on the interactions between the interfacial proteins and lipid molecules [23]. For example, human synovial sPLA2 was found to be partially immersed in the lipid bilayer [24]. In another work, the role of the lipid membrane as an allosteric activator for sPLA2 was demonstrated [25]. Multiple roles of aromatic residues in membrane binding were shown by free-energy perturbation calculations for Naja naja atra PLA2 [26]. Complementary to the modeling approaches, atomic force, transmission electron, or scanning confocal microscopy, accompanied by a number of spectroscopy methods, allow obtaining data on how the enzyme acts upon lipid bilayer at not atomic, but nano scale. Recently, non-enzymatic corruption of the lipid bilayer by heterodimer PLA2 [27], reorientation of the protein molecule on the membrane surface upon Ca2+ action [28], and formation of new enzyme binding sites on the bilayer surface caused by the action of sPLA2 [29] were reported. Yet these data do not answer the question why, showing no preference to the lipid tail structure [5], sPLA2 is sensitive to the phase state of lipid bilayer [9], which in turn is dependent upon the lipid tail structure [30]? Why the hydrolysis of a gel-phase bilayer proceeds via autocatalysis where the products act as enzyme activators, while there are no binding sites for the hydrolysis products on the enzyme surface?
We herein combine experimental techniques—fluorescent spectroscopy, DLS, and TEM—and computer simulation (coarse-grained and full-atom molecular dynamics) to study how a group III secretory phospholipase A2 from bee venom (bvPLA2) interacts with gel or fluid phase PC bilayers prior to catalysis.
