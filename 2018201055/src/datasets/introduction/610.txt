Although concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns composed of a circular section provide effective confinement to the core concrete compared to their rectangular counterparts, the latter ones are often preferred in constructing composite columns owing to their ease of connection to the steel beams. Octagonal concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns as illustrated in Fig. 1 can be utilized to support large loads in composite buildings, transmission towers, and composite bridges owing to the combined advantages of CFST circular and square columns in terms of concrete confinement, ease connection to the steel beams. The confinement provided by the octagonal steel tube is greater than that induced by the rectangular section whereas the orthogonal section provides ease of connection to the steel beam compared to their circular counterparts. In addition, the aesthetic appearance of octagonal shape leads to the use of octagonal CFST columns in tall building structures. However, it is expected that the structural response of octagonal CFST columns is significantly different from that of the square and circular ones. As the octagonal cross-section is not exactly circular, the confinement on the filled concrete induced by the octagonal steel tube is not as great as that caused by the circular one. Therefore, an accurate confinement model needs to be developed for such columns to accurately predict their structural responses to loading. However, such a development has rarely been undertaken. Owing to the limited research studies, international standards such as ACI 318-11 [1], Eurocode 4 [2], and AISC 360-16 [3] have not specified design rules for such composite columns. This paper is concerned with numerical simulation of short octagonal CFST columns, accurately accounting for conferment effects by developing a new confinement model of concrete in octagonal steel tube.Download : Download high-res image (80KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

There have been extensive experimental works on the behavior of circular and rectangular CFST short columns, such as those by Sakino et al. [4], Fujimoto et al. [5], Giakoumelis and Lam [6], Lee et al. [7], Uy et al. [8], Xiong et al. [9] and Huang et al. [10]. It was observed from the experiments undertaken by Sakino et al. [4] that the circular tube exerted greater confinement to the filled concrete than the rectangular one. However, the concrete confinement in a CFST circular column decreases as the diameter-to-thickness ratio (D/t) increases. Xiong et al. [9] studied the sensitivities of the performance of composite columns of different cross-sections to ultra-high-strength materials. It was observed that the utilization of high-strength materials is beneficial for composite columns in terms of size and strength, however, the ductility of columns is significantly compromised.
Experimental studies on polygonal CFST columns including octagonal cross-section have been very limited [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The tested columns studied by Tomii et al. [11] had the D/t ratios varying from 37 to 75. It was reported that CFST columns displaced ductile failure modes owing to the confinement on the core concrete. However, increasing the ratio of D/t decreased the columns ultimate loads remarkably. Ding et al. [14] tested eight specimens with the ratio of D/t up to 126 and concrete cube strengths of 39.3 MPa and 57.4 MPa. An interesting finding of their study was that increasing the steel ratio markedly increased the resistances of the columns when low-grade concrete was used. The test specimens reported by Zhu and Chan [17] on CFST columns with various cross-sections were filled with concrete of compressive strength up to 112 MPa. Test results indicated that the confinement in octagonal CFST columns was lesser than that in circular CFST columns but was much greater than that in rectangular counterparts. This is because the flat steel plates of an octagonal CFST column cannot provide effective confinement to the filled concrete. The unified methods for calculating the load-bearing capacities and fire resistance of CFST columns with polygonal shapes including octagonal section were suggested by Yu et al. [19], [20], [21].
Numerical models of nonlinear analysis were presented by Susantha et al. [22], Ding et al. [13], [14], Xu et al. [15], Hassanein et al. [23], [24] to investigate the responses of polygonal CFST columns. Susantha et al. [22] proposed material models for implementation in computational procedures of predicting the ultimate capacities of CFST columns having square, circular, and octagonal cross-sections. The FE model developed by Hassanein et al. [23] using Abaqus utilized the concrete stress-strain laws originally proposed by Dai and Lam [25] and the confining stress model given by Patel et al. [26]. Ding et al. [13], [14] modified the triaxial concrete model originally proposed by Ottosen and Ristinmaa [27] to determine the behavior of concrete in polygonal CFST columns. The confinement models used in the mentioned studies were not derived directly from test results, therefore, may either underestimate or overestimate structural responses of CFST octagonal columns. To accurately quantify the structural behavior of CFST octagonal columns, further study should be performed to develop a confinement model by interpreting the available test results.
This paper presents new constitutive laws of concrete in octagonal steel-concrete composite columns, including a constitutive model for confining pressure and a factor for quantifying the compressive residual strength of concrete. A numerical modeling method employing the theory of nonlinear fiber analysis is formulated that incorporates the new concrete material laws for the simulation of nonlinear CFST columns composed of octagonal section. The variable factors of octagonal columns on their structural responses are examined in a detailed parameter study. A design model is proposed for octagonal CFST columns and compared against the experimental data. The applicability of design specifications given by ACI 318-11 [1], Eurocode 4 [2], and AISC 360-16 [3] is evaluated for designing CFST octagonal stub columns.
