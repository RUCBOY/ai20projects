Graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, has attracted tremendous attentions due to its excellent electronic characteristics and high transparency [1], [2], [3], [4]. In particular, graphene undergoes an ambipolar electric field effect where both holes and electrons can be induced in it depending upon the polarity of a gate bias [5], [6]. For developing graphene-based electronic devices and circuits, doping to graphene is essential, which can tune the Fermi level and carrier concentration of graphene [7]. However, traditional doping methods such as chemical doping and electrostatic doping would inevitably damage the graphene structure or consume extra energy [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. Piezoelectric and triboelectric potentials have been proposed to dope graphene in field-effect transistors (FETs) and realize low-power consuming sensing devices [14], [15]. Nevertheless, these devices generally require to combine with additional piezo/triboelectric nanogenerators [16], [17], [18], [19], which undoubtedly increase the complexity and manufacturing difficulty of the devices.
Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE), comprised of ionic salt and polymer matrix, typically has a very higher capacitance (1–10 μF/cm2) than conventional dielectric materials such as Al2O3, Ta2O5, TiO2 etc. [20], [21]. Thus, SPE can be an excellent candidate as a gate dielectric for FETs [22], [23], [24]. Under the gate electric field, nanometer-thick electric double layers (EDLs) are formed at the SPE/semiconductor interface and, as a consequence, such an electrolyte-gating allows low operational gate voltages of within ±3 V for FETs [25], [26], [27], [28]. Remarkably, SPEs undergo a piezoionic effect where a non-uniform deformation of the SPEs induces an internal Donnan potential due to the ionic concentration gradient and an inhomogeneous movement of cations and anions [29]. The piezoionic effect can potentially transform the mechanical strain into an electric signal. Like piezoelectric and triboelectric potential-gated FETs [14], [15], [30], [31], the piezoionic potential can also be utilized as a gate bias to realize the self-gated FET.
Here, we demonstrate a piezoionic-powered strain sensor using mechanically doped graphene with SPE. When strain is applied, the piezoionic potential modulates the carrier concentration in the graphene channel. As a consequence, the Dirac point voltage (VDirac) of an SPE-coated graphene FET (S-GFET) undergoes a shift (a positive shift of ~450 mV due to a tensile strain of ~0.20% and a negative shift of ~300 mV due to a compressive strain of ~0.16%). This new doping technique has ability to tune pristine graphene to n-type doping state or p-type doping state. It was found that the S-GFET device effectively responds to the applied strain (from as low as ~0.045% to ~0.231%) with a gauge factor of approximately −16 and fully recovers at the strain removal. It has shown excellent stability with a long operation over 2000 times cycles. Besides, with an opposite current change, the strain sensor can distinguish between the compressive and tensile strains which has in fact been the major limitation with the capacitive and resistive strain sensors [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. Additionally, the device is multifunctional as it can also be operated as a touch sensor where the triboelectric potential, due to contact electrification between SPE and the external object, modulates the current transport in the S-GFET. The flexible, transparent S-GFET sensor has been demonstrated to very accurately detect joint motion of hand with potentially strong prospects for use in a long-term rehabilitation process.
