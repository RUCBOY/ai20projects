With the dramatic development and prevalence of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), it becomes vital to identify AD pathology at its early stage or even before its onset because the neuropathological progression in AD may begin many years before the appearance of clinical symptoms [1], [2], [3]. Many studies employed neuroimaging data such as structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) to conduct early disease diagnosis of AD [4], [5], [6]. For example, Khedher et al. presented a computer aided system which uses partial least squares and principle component analysis to conduct classification among the data such as AD, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Control (NC) [7], while Ortiz et al. investigated the ensemble of two deep learning architectures to discriminate AD from NC [8]. Zhu et al. proposed a joint regression and classification model using structural MRI and PET data [9].
Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is the symptomatic predementia stage of AD, characterized by cognitive and functional impairment not severe enough to fulfill the criteria for dementia [10], [11]. The MCI possibly progressing to AD over times is called the progressive MCI (pMCI) and the MCI remaining stable for a long time is called the stable MCI (sMCI). In the early diagnosis of AD, it perhaps is the most interesting problem to distinguish pMCI subjects from sMCI subjects, i.e., the pMCI/sMCI classification, due to that (1) i n the pathological spectrum of AD, MCI may be the optimal stage that clinical treatments or interventions can be effectively administered to prevent or delay decline to severe dementia; (2) 10% to 15% of MCI population will progress to AD annually [12], [13]; and (3) the intervention treatment is more effective before the patients progress to AD [14], [15], [16].Download : Download high-res image (464KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. An illustration of the proposed method. The boxes with purple solid lines, red solid lines, and blue solid lines, respectively, represent the original MRI images of ADs and NCs, the original MRI images of pMCIs and sMCIs, and the original PET images of pMCIs and sMCI. The boxes with purple dot lines, red dot lines, and blue dot lines, respectively, represent the MRI feature of ADs and NCs, the MRI features of pMCIs and sMCIs, and the PET features of pMCIs and sMCI. The green box indicates the combination process of the auxiliary data and the predictor data using our proposed method. Moreover, the vertical red solid line denotes the removal of uninformative features and the horizontal yellow dot line indicates robustness against outlier subjects.

However, due to the subtle pathological changes (i.e., brain atrophy) which may be masked by the normal aging effect and/or the inter-subject variations [17], [18], it is very challenging to discriminate pMCI from sMCI. First, the pMCI has minor inter-group difference, compared to the sMCI so that many previous studies integrated the pMCI with the sMCI as a single category, i.e., MCI [19]. Second, there is high intra-group variations for either the pMCI subjects or the sMCI subjects [20]. That is, different subjects in the same group (i.e., either the pMCIs or the sMCIs) have high intra-group variations, making difficult construct classification models. Third, the number of MCI subjects is small, but the feature number is usually high. As a result, the pMCI/sMCI classification often suffers from the issues of small-sized sample and high-dimensional data [21], [22], [23] to easily result in the problem of curse of dimensionality [20], [24]. Moreover, previous classification models are affected by redundant features and subject-level noise [21], [25]. Hence, it is very vital to investigate informative and discriminative patterns to address above issues.
Recent studies have proposed a number of pattern recognition methods to improve the performance of the pMCI/sMCI classification by addressing one or more of the above issues [26]. For example, Zhu et al. proposed a Bayesian method to detect the association between structural MRI and genetic data by taking into account the ages of the subjects [27], assuming that brain atrophy is influenced by both the normal aging and the disease [17]. Wang et al. first demonstrated that the AD/NC classification is similar to the pMCI/sMCI classification, considering that the pMCI is like to the AD and the sMCI is like to the NC, and then employed the AD data and NC data for the pMCI/sMCI classification [28]. With the above assumption, the studies [25], [29], [30] designed transfer learning techniques for the pMCI/sMCI classification. Previous techniques share the common characteristics as follows, i.e., using auxiliary information to improve the classification performance of the predictor data. By regarding the MRI information of both pMCI and sMCI subjects as the predictor data, the auxiliary data can be the information, such as the ages of the subjects, the MRI information of the AD and NC subjects, the PET data, and the genetic information. In practice, each kind of auxiliary information could be heterogeneous to others [31]. Hence, using these heterogeneous information together for the pMCI/sMCI classification is complex and challengeable.
In this paper, we extend our conference version in [20] to use MRI features as the predictor data to identify whether a MCI subject progresses to AD (i.e., pMCI) or not (i.e., sMCI) within 24 months. However, unlike the existing approaches that mostly utilized the predictor data only, we further exploit source information of a subject’s age and available PET features. Specifically, we formulate a novel sparse regression model that jointly uses the auxiliary data and the predictor data for feature selection, so that the useful knowledge of the auxiliary data can be transferred to the predictor data. There are three key factors strengthening our method, (i) (feature selection) we use the auxiliary data to select informative features in the predictor data; (ii) (outlier robustness) our formulation is robust to outliers from both the auxiliary data and the predictor data; and (iii) (aging effect removal) we also include a subject’s age as one of the features in each subject to learn its relationship with the neuroimaging features in the prediction model.
Different from previous studies of the pMCI/sMCI classification, the contributions of our method are twofold. First, we consider three kinds of auxiliary information, i.e., the age, the MRI data of the AD and NC subjects, and the PET data of the pMCI and sMCI subjects. The auxiliary information is jointly involved in selecting features, which discriminates our method from the existing methods [17], [29], [32], [33] that only used a part of them. We argue that the auxiliary information can be complementary and related to each other in some ways, and thus utilizing such information separately and sequentially is inevitably limited. Our method, in contrast, integrates all auxiliary information in a unified framework. Second, we conduct the pMCI/sMCI classification with the consideration of outlier influence on both the auxiliary data and the predictor data, to select useful features jointly and robustly. In contrast, Moradi et al. used the auxiliary data for feature selection only [17].
