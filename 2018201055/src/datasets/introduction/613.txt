The molecular donor-acceptor (D-A) systems realizing the photoinduced electron transfer process attract considerable interest as potential photovoltaic components. Most times, various dyes are used as donors (D) in these D-A systems: BODIPY [[1], [2], [3], [4]], porphyrins [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]], and phthalocyanines [[10], [11], [12]]. The popular acceptors (A) for ones are fullerenes [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8],[10], [11], [12], [13]]. They are able to provide easy charge delocalization throughout their structure and unique capabilities for charge particle stabilization. Basically, functionalized fullerene analogues are used to simplify their covalent binding in D-A system preparing.
Another rapidly developing approach for photoactive component production is supramolecular self-assembly of non-covalent fullerene systems [[14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Compared to covalent binding, the main advantage of this approach is the synthesis simplicity. In this regard, the search of powerful π-electron-donor systems that are capable to form the molecular fullerene complexes due to π-stacking becomes an important task. Earlier, we showed that binuclear double-helical zinc bis(dipyrromethenate)s ([Zn2L2]) form stable supramolecular π-π complexes with small aromatic molecules [[22], [23], [24], [25]]. We showed [16] that [Zn2(3)2] (Scheme 1) forms stable non-covalent supramolecular complexes with C60 with the [Zn2(3)2(C60)4] composition. As we know, this is the only example of a supramolecular system based on bis(dipyrromethenate)s and C60.Download : Download high-res image (310KB)Download : Download full-size imageScheme 1.

Therefore in this paper, we continue to study supramolecular systems based on [Zn2L2]s with C60 and present the results of study of [Zn2L2]s periphery methylation degree effect on their supramolecular complexation with C60 (Scheme 1). The obtained [Zn2L2(C60)n] supramolecular systems were characterized by UV/vis, fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, FT-IR and DOSY spectroscopy. The experimental studies were supplemented by quantum-chemical calculations of [Zn2L2(C60)n] supramolecular systems, that made possible to advance guesses about their structure and energy transfer mechanism. The photoelectrochemical characteristics of the Ti | TiO2 electrode modified by synthesized complexes were obtained by amperometry method. We compared these properties with characteristics of open-chain chromophores, cyclic oligopyrroles, and supramolecular systems with fullerenes based on them which were obtained under the same conditions. The results show further investigation prospect of zinc bis(dipyrromethenate)s as photoactive components for different photovoltaic devices.
