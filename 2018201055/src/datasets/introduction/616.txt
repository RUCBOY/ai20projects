The emergence of different online shopping websites has changed our daily habits. Websites such as Amazon, Taobao, and countless others allow people to post and share their reviews and feedback about the purchased products [1]. Many customers refer to these reviews before making their buying decisions. About 70% of customers find these reviews as one of the major trusted sources in making their decisions. Manufacturers also use these reviews to analyze the defects of their products, as the pre-discovery of product defects can maximize the reputation of the manufacturers, which in turn increases their sales [2]. In addition, manufacturers use these reviews to explore the most important product aspects by customers. According to Akalamkam and Mitra [3], pre-purchase decisions by a huge numbers of customers are based on conducting pre-search through online reviews provided by previous customers. As about 90% of consumers depend on online reviews for making a purchase decision [4], this habit is now considered as a major step by customers before deciding to buy any products online. However, the process of reviewing and retrieving the reviews by customers is time consuming and cumbersome due to the huge volume of available information. Thus, automatic solutions to this process have been developed which are collectively categorized as Sentiment Analysis (SA).
SA is defined as the detection of authors’ opinion expressions toward entities or their facets [5]. Millions of people daily express and share their opinions about different commercial products [6]. Therefore, SA has attracted popularity by research community for processing the huge amount of available data on social media such as blogs, collaborative media, social networks, and online communities [5], [7].
SA is a branch of affective computing research [8]. The primary purpose of SA is to classify text, audio, and video [9] into either negative or positive, or even neutral opinions [10]. According to Cambria et al. [11], SA is a big suitcase which encapsulating several natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These NLP tasks include word polarity disambiguation [12]; concept extraction [13]; sarcasm detection [14]; aspect extraction [15]; and subjectivity detection [16]. SA has been applied in such diverse applications as dialogue systems [17]; e-health [18]; community detection [19]; financial forecasting [20]; manufacturing applications [21]; and countless others.
SA can be performed at different levels including the document, sentence, or aspect (feature) levels [22]. At the document and sentence levels, the task is based on extracting all opinion words in a sentence or document, after which it outputs the opinion to the whole document or sentence. Whereas, aspect level sentiment analysis is concerned with the extraction of product aspects and the opinion words mentioned in the reviews toward each aspect [22]. Analysis at the document and sentence levels is ultimately based on the overall document or sentence without considering specific analysis to each aspect, while SA at aspect level considers each aspect and it associates each aspect with its related opinion words. One of the most important tasks in aspect level sentiment analysis is the aspect or feature extraction step [22], where the aspect can be either explicit or implicit. The aspect is considered as explicit if it is mentioned explicitly in the text. For example, in the review, “the screen is very nice”, the aspect screen is mentioned explicitly. On the other hand, if the aspect is mentioned implicitly in a text, it is known as implicit aspect. For example, in a review about a hand phone, “the phone is expensive”, the opinion word expensive is an indicator for price implicit aspect of the hand phone [23]. The implicit aspect extraction methods which were developed by the previous studies can be unsupervised, semi-supervised, or supervised [24].
Aspect extraction plays an important role in aspect-based sentiment analysis [25], [26], [27], and represents an important phase for product and feature ranking applications [1], [28], [29], [30]. In addition, aspect extraction represents the most important phase in an aspect retrieval system [31]. Several studies have been conducted into explicit aspect extraction. The extraction techniques used in previous studies can be classified as either unsupervised such as [23], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], semi-supervised [28], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], or supervised [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], [49].
Many previous studies used either a dependency-based approach, such as [36], [39], [50], [51], [52] or a pattern-based approach [34], [53], [54], [55]. Extraction types based on pattern-based or dependency-based rules give promising results. However, according to previous studies [55], [56], [57], [58], aspect extraction approaches based on dependency relations have the problem of generating error results, which occur as the dependency relations accuracy are based on the grammatical correctness of the reviews, while not all online reviews follow English grammar rules. Also, these reviews usually are mixed types of structured and unstructured text. In addition, there is no restriction from the website on the customer to follow language rules when they post his/her review. Customers may follow the language rules in writing and sometimes may violate some of it [55]. The pattern-based approach is good for such unstructured text, as the patterns mimic the ways users write their reviews [55].
Based on our preliminary findings, there are some problems in the current works. For example, methods which are based on topic modeling can only extract the general aspects and ignore the fine-grained aspects. In methods which are based on statistics for aspect extraction, these methods results are based on the size of the datasets used. Therefore, if the size of the dataset is small, then the results are unreliable. In addition, some methods utilized bootstrapping method for aspect extraction. However, this method suffers from the problem of error propagation and extracts many incorrect aspect words. Moreover, aspect extraction which is based on using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) cannot be applied to sentences with long patterns. Furthermore, works which are based on using dependency relations or syntactic pattern rules are characterized by some issues namely: (1) limited number of rules were used for extraction; (2) many aspect extraction rules were not explored; (3) the existence of irrelevant rules which result in extracting many incorrect aspect words; and (4) the unavailability of suitable aspects pruning algorithm. Therefore, further works are required to overcome these issues.
Thus, in this paper, the main aim is to propose an aspect extraction algorithm to extract aspects from both formal and informal texts. To achieve this aim, we have come up with a number of contributions. These contributions (in bold) and its importance can be summarized by following key points:

•Many new extraction rules are developed in this study. These rules are developed to overcome the weakness of existing rules. In addition, to overcome the unexplored aspect extraction rules by previous studies.•The combination of rules from different types. These rules include the new developed rules in this study and the rules used from previous studies. This rules combination is necessary to take advantage of both types of rules at the same time. In addition, they cover both formal and informal texts.•Improved Whale Optimization Algorithm (IWOA) for rules selection problem. The development of IWOA algorithm is important to help in selecting the best subset of rules from the full set of rules. If we have n rules, then if we want to try all possible rules subsets it will be NP-hard problem, because it requires 2n to find the optimal rules subset from all possible subsets. Therefore, IWOA will be used to solve this problem.•Two major improvements were included into WOA. These improvements are to solve WOA weakness and make it fit for rules selection problem.•The development of new update equation using Cauchy Mutation. This first improvement to WOA is necessary to improve the diversity of WOA (rules diversity) by diversifying the combination of each IWOA solution (selected and unselected rules).•The development of new local search algorithm (LSA). LSA is combined with WOA to improve the current best solution (exploitation) [this will help select the rules which further improve the extraction performance], then it avoids WOA from being stuck at local.•The development of three phases aspects Pruning Algorithm (PA). The PA algorithm is important to purify the candidate aspects. In addition, it can improve the extraction performance by solving the problem of pruning less frequent occurring aspects which were pruned by previous studies.
Therefore, as detailed above, this study proposes a novelIWOA+PA algorithm for aspect extraction which is characterized by novelty in a number of points, such as the development of new aspect extraction rules, the extraction of aspect from reviews regardless if its structured or not, the application of IWOA for rules selection, the improvements to WOA, and the three phase pruning algorithm.
The proposed IWOA+PA algorithm utilized supervised approach for aspect extraction, since the selection of optimal rules is based on training dataset. The proposed methodology ofIWOA+PA will be performed on a number of steps. First, IWOA selects the optimal subset of rules from the full set of rules based on a training dataset. Then, the best selected rules will be applied on the testing dataset. The candidate aspects which are the results of the best selected rules by IWOA will go to next step. These candidate aspects will be purified by using PA algorithm. The details of these steps will be discussed in the following sections.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses related works on extraction methods. Section 3 presents the workflow of the proposed aspect extraction algorithm. Section 4 presents the aspect extraction rules used in this study. Section 5 explains the details of IWOA algorithm while Section 6 describes the details of the aspect pruning algorithm. Section 7 presents the experimental results and analysis. Finally, Section 8 concludes the finding of this study.
