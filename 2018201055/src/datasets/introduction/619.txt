Seismic exploration is a method of petroleum exploration using seismic information. Seismic information can reflect the change trend of reservoir parameters. Hence, reservoir parameters can be predicted by establishing the corresponding relationship between seismic attributes and reservoir parameters obtained by logging. With the rapid development of seismic technology, the use of seismic attributes to predict reservoir characteristic parameters will become an inevitable trend in future oil and gas exploration and development. Researchers hope to extract more seismic attributes with greater reliability from seismic data to reduce the uncertainty in the analysis of seismic attributes further. Pre-stack seismic data contain more fluid information compared with post-stack seismic data, and the pre-stack inversion method has significant advantages such as stable results, high resolution, and strong controllability. Therefore, inversion based on pre-stack seismic data has been a hot topic in the field of seismic exploration in recent years.
The amplitude variation with offset (AVO) technique [1] is currently the most commonly used technique for predicting oil and gas using pre-stack data. This technique can make full use of seismic data and has been widely used in oil and gas detection. Pre-stack seismic data contain abundant useful information for predicting underground oil and gas conditions [2], including three elastic parameters, namely, the longitudinal wave velocity Vp, transverse wave velocity Vs, and density ρ. These three elastic parameters can indirectly reflect the saturation of underground oil and gas. The relationship between the longitudinal wave velocity Vp and gas saturation is non-linear, the relationship between the density ρ and gas saturation is linear, and the transverse wave velocity Vs can reflect some rock characteristics. Therefore, information on the changes of these three elastic parameters is required when judging the saturation of underground oil and gas. In the inversion process, these three parameters are continuously adjusted to achieve the goal of matching the corresponding parameters of the actual terrain. Therefore, the inversion process of pre-stack seismic AVO elastic parameters is an optimisation process. Intelligent optimisation algorithms have strong local and global optimisation abilities and good convergence, and the unique advantages and mechanisms of intelligent optimisation algorithms have attracted the attention of scholars and have been successfully applied in many fields [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26].
Geophysical inversion requires the construction of an appropriate objective function followed by its optimisation to obtain the optimal solution. However, the objective function is often non-linear; hence, non-linear global intelligent optimisation inversion technology has attracted the attention of experts and scholars in geophysical fields. Rothman used simulated annealing for optimising automatic residual static correction [27]. Berg theoretically analysed the possibility of applying a genetic algorithm to multi-parameter inversion [28]. Mallick used a genetic algorithm to solve the problem of AVO inversion [29]. Misra applied a fast-simulated annealing algorithm to pre-stack AVO inversion based on boundary protection and achieved high inversion accuracy [30]. Porsani et al. combined a genetic algorithm with the linear inversion method and applied it to seismic waveform inversion [31]. Priezzhev et al. combined a neural network and a genetic algorithm to study the non-linear inversion of data from multiple seismic traces and used the genetic algorithm to optimise the learning process of the neural network [32]. Pantelis Soupios et al. proposed the idea of a hybrid genetic algorithm, applied the idea to different geophysical problems, and used the combination of a genetic algorithm and a local optimisation method to rectify the shortcomings of the algorithm [33]. Numerous non-linear global intelligent optimisation inversion techniques have been widely applied to various types of inversion problems, and many remarkable research results have been obtained [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42]. Although intelligent optimisation algorithms are an important method for solving geophysical inversion problems, they also face some difficulties in geophysical non-linear inversion.
First, although these intelligent algorithms have been widely used in various fields and have been proven to be effective, they have some limitations. For example, although the simulated annealing algorithm has the advantages of strong robustness of the initial value, universal applicability, and easy implementation, the setting of the annealing temperature has a considerable influence on the algorithm. The genetic algorithm has limitations such as a poor local search ability and easy prematurity. The ant colony optimisation algorithm has the advantage of a strong ability to find solutions, but its process is complex. The particle swarm optimisation algorithm has the advantage of a fast convergence speed, but it has the disadvantages of low inversion accuracy and easy divergence.
Second, seismic inversion technology is continuously developing. The huge amount of data used in pre-stack inversion results in a rapid increase in the amount of calculations in the entire inversion process, which greatly increases the amount of data processing of intelligent algorithms in geophysical non-linear inversion, whereas the calculation efficiency of intelligent optimisation algorithms is generally low.
The emergence of parallel machines provides basic conditions for the use of non-linear optimisation methods, which require a large amount of computations. The rise of cloud computing technology in recent years has made large-scale computing possible [43], [44]. MapReduce can be combined with many commonly used intelligent algorithms, especially algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, which are characterised by parallelism. According to previous studies, although the genetic algorithm can usually find a satisfactory solution to the problem within a reasonable time period, as the complexity and scale of the problem to be solved increase, the calculation time of the algorithm will greatly increase, and thus the calculation efficiency will decrease. With the extensive application of the genetic algorithm, the improvement of the operating efficiency of the genetic algorithm is an urgent problem that needs to be solved. Owing to the inherent parallelism of the genetic algorithm, its parallel processing can be considered to be jointly determined by the inherent characteristics of the algorithm and the requirements of the problem on the algorithm. Parallel processing can not only improve the speed of solving the genetic algorithm, but it can also expand the population size to maintain the diversity of the population and prevent premature convergence, thereby improving the quality of problem solving.
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic principle of pre-stack seismic AVO elastic parameter inversion and MapReduce technology. In Section 3, based on previous studies, the MapReduce parallel framework is modified, and the corresponding intelligent inversion method is proposed. Section 4 presents the experimental results and analysis. Finally, Section 5 presents a summary of the paper.
