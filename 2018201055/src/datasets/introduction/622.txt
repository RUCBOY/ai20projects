Image registration is one of the most important technologies in computer vision research field. After years of development, image registration technology has made important applications in augmented reality (AR), autonomous navigation, medical image processing, 3-D reconstruction, 3-D scanning, dense mapping, and other fields [1], [2], [3], [4]. Registration refers to the identification of the pixel in each image, from a collection of the same scene, which corresponds to the same physical point [5]. Images might be acquired from different viewpoints, at different times, by different sensors or simply with different camera or exposure settings [5], [6].
Due to the uncertainty of image registration, there are still many problems to be solved, such as low texture, occlusion, distortion, radiometric changes and so on. Image registration is a typical label classification problem. Under certain constraints, the stereo image registration can be achieved by establishing an optimal cost and aggregation function. Then how to get these optimal functions in image registration has become a hot research topic in recent years, and it is also the key point to affect the registration accuracy. Stereo image registration algorithm is generally divided into four steps: cost computation, cost aggregation, disparity selection and disparity refinement [7], [8], [9]. Most image registration algorithms are based on the assumption that corresponding pixels in stereo images have same intensity [2], [10], [11]. Simple and common cost generation metrics include color differences (RGB) [9], [10], [12], [13], intensity [2], [7], gradient differences (GRAD) [4], [7], [14], [15], [16], Euclidean distance [17], [18], sum of absolute differences (SAD), normalized cross-correlation (NCC) [2], [19], [20] Census Transform [3], [4], [11], [21] and Mutual Information (MI) [16], [21], [22]. In the work by Pinggera et al. [23], Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) was also used to compare stereo images. Cost aggregation adopts the optimization strategy of propagating the cost volumes to local, semi-local or global to minimize the probability of mis-registration. Most cost aggregation methods are implemented by defining the local support region of the target pixel, which is very similar to image adjustment or filtering technology. Simple Gaussian smoothing has high processing speed. However, due to its isotropic properties, it is easy to cause fuzzy boundary or fattening effect, which leads to poor quality of registration results.
In the aspect of boundary preserving, two key boundary preserving filters were proposed, which have an important impact on stereo image registration. They are image bilateral filter (BF) [18] and guided filter (GF) [24], respectively. In bilateral filtering, the fusion of Euclidean distance and color differences is used as a new Gaussian kernel to control the weights in different directions of the filter by the two indicators of distance and color difference. The guided filter skillfully acquires the parameter information between the original image and the filtered image using linear regression model. Based on GF, the work by Hamzah et al. [4] proposed an iterative guided filter and graph segmentation method for image registration, which requires extra massive calculation cost. High-precision algorithm was proposed in [11] that combines absolute difference with Census Transform (AD-Census), but it runs slowly and requires GPU acceleration. The work by Yang et al. [9] is the first non-local (NL) cost aggregation method exploiting two-way tree structure, which can propagate the cost value of each pixel to the whole image quickly. On the basis of [9], the Simple-tree [2], Segment-tree (ST) [10] and Cross-scale generation framework [13] were proposed to improve registration accuracy and reduce the calculation expense. Recently, it has been shown in [25], [26] convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can yield more reliable costs and improve overall stereo matching performances. But the CNNs based algorithms require a great quantity of data (Ground Truth) to train the model and test the results, which is expensive, time-consuming. All these state-of-the-art matching methods have made great contributions to image registration in stereo vision, but most of them do not consider the radiometric changes, such as different illumination and exposure.Download : Download high-res image (272KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Different from traditional methods, ICIR has strong robustness and can produce better selectivity (the higher the cost, the greater the similarity).
