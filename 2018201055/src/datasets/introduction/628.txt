In this note, we derive a uniformly fast random variate generator for the family of densities that are proportional to f(x)=x−λexp−x,x∈[s,t),where 0<s<t≤∞ and λ≥1 are the parameters. For λ<1, we obtain the standard gamma (1−λ) distribution, for which many good algorithms are available (see [2], [6] and [4]). For this reason we will call this the negative gamma family. Since it must be a density, we cannot have s=0.
This distribution appears in the astrophysics literature where it is known as the power law with cut-off, or the power law with exponential cut-off. Our nomenclature stresses the tight connection with the gamma distribution.
Deriving uniformly fast algorithms for multi-parameter families of distributions becomes harder as the number of parameters grows. With three parameters, λ, s and t, one must be very careful. Our method is based on the fact that after an exponential transformation, the distribution is log-concave on its support.
The algorithms here are designed for situations in which one or more of the parameters change on each call. If they are static, then there are various other methods that should be considered, including table methods and adaptive rejection sampling [5].
