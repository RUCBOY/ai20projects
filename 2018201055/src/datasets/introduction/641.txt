Increased uncertainties in design parameters undermine the accuracy and effectiveness of the mapping of embedded applications to architecture platforms in embedded systems design. We define uncertainty as the inability to quantify deterministically or accurately (with high confidence) various design parameters, which could include specific characteristics of the hardware platform or intermediate calculations of design attributes of interest such as latency and performance. In order to address these uncertainties in design parameters, previous studies in [1], [2] attempted to capture uncertainty in the process of optimization of embedded systems. However, system reliability was considered as the only uncertain design parameter in these studies. The work in [3] is the first attempt to address the problem of multi-objective (reliability, performance, and energy) mapping for embedded systems under uncertainties. The study in [4] extends the work in [3] by modeling multiple correlated sources of uncertainty. However, both studies from [3], [4] focus on hardware architectures formed by multiple processing elements (PEs) interconnected via a bus-based communication only and Network-on-Chip (NoC) based architectures were not considered.
Network-on-chip is a reliable and scalable communication paradigm proven to be a better alternative to the traditional bus in modern system-on-chip designs [5]. Many previous studies addressed the problem of application mapping on NoC based architectures. Some of them focused on optimizing one metric only, either reliability, or performance, or communication delay, or temperature [6], [7], [8]. The work in [6] focused on reliability-aware application mapping onto mesh NoCs. The study in [7] improved genetic algorithm based NoC mapping by using a formal model to reduce communication latency. The work in [8] proposed a temperature aware partitioning and placement algorithm to eliminated or reduce on-chip hotspots. Some other previous works focused on optimizing two or three design metrics [9], [10], [11], [12]. The study in [9] proposed flexible energy and delay aware mapping for the co-optimization of energy consumption and communication latency for NoCs. The work in [10] proposed a multi-objective evolutionary based decision to help NoC designers to find the best mapping that minimizes power, hardware area, and execution time requirements of the application. The studies in [11], [12] studied multi-objective (reliability, communication energy, and performance) mapping approaches to find optimal solutions for mapping applications on NoC reconfigurable architectures. The study in [11] focused on the mapping approach for the co-optimization of reliability, communication energy, and performance in NoC-based reconfigurable architectures. The communication energy and latency are first considered in energy latency product (ELP), which is then co-optimized with reliability. In the meanwhile, the work in [12] focused on the energy and reliability-aware mapping under performance constraints for NoC-based reconfigurable architectures. The authors first developed a parameterized cost model by combining energy and reliability with a weight parameter; then, the overall mapping cost is evaluated using the parameterized cost model under performance constraints.
Moreover, other previous works focused specifically on the process of Design Space Exploration (DSE) during mapping optimization of NoCs. Among them, the studies in [14], [15] focus on static mapping, the study in [16] deals with dynamic mapping, and the study in [17] focuses on hybrid mapping. The authors in [14] proposed a machine-learning-inspired predictive design methodology for energy-efficient and reliable manycore architectures enabled by 3D integration. The study in [15] presented an investigation of the performance-thermal tradeoffs for energy efficient monolithic 3D manycore chips. The work in [16] presents an innovative run-time mapping approach, where identification of a candidate mapping for a use-case is done by the online execution trace analysis of the active applications. The authors of [17] proposed a novel meta-heuristic DSE approach for hybrid application mapping that eliminates architectural symmetries and reduces the mapping search space by abstracting the problem to the clustering of tasks and their mapping to processor types.
However, none of the previous NoC based application mapping approaches considered uncertainty in design parameters. In our previous work [3], we demonstrated that not considering uncertainty in design parameters might result in suboptimal solutions during application mapping on bus based architecture platforms. Because NoC can be affected by uncertainties as well, in this paper, for the first time, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware multi-objective (reliability, performance, and energy consumption) static mapping approach for NoC based heterogeneous Systems-on-Chip (SoCs) running with single application. More specifically, in this paper, we make the following contributions:
•We propose a novel uncertainty-aware reliability model for mapping on NoC based architectures. The proposed reliability model in this paper is the first work to consider the uncertainty in design parameters for hardware platforms where NoC is used for communication between cores.•We propose novel uncertainty-aware reliability, performance, and energy consumption models, which are applied to both the computational and communication components.•We present a multi-objective optimization formulation for the problem of uncertainty-aware mapping for NoC based architectures.•We develop a solution to the formulated mapping problem. The solution is based on the NSGA-II genetic algorithm and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, and it integrates the proposed uncertainty-aware models into a computer-aided design tool.•Finally, we also investigate the impact of different levels of uncertainty and uncertainty correlations.
