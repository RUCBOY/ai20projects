Environmental trace evidence, often referred to as Forensic Ecology, is a well-recognised area of forensic science that utilises the interaction between people and the environment in relation to crime [[1], [2], [3]]. Environmental samples serve as ideal forms of contact trace evidence as the detection at a scene can provide a source of valuable forensic information to establish a link between a suspect, location and victim. Traditional forensic ecology requires the characterisation of physical specimens such as plant fragments, pollen, diatoms, fungi or insects, via morphology and thus requires a diverse range of expertise, e.g. a botanist, palynologist, mycologist and entomologist. Despite large numbers of unsolved crimes, and thus the need to develop additional tools to link suspects to crimes [4], forensic ecology remains under-utilised in casework due to a limited number of experts. However, the recent advent of Massive Parallel Sequencing (MPS) has sparked interest in environmental trace evidence as it offers a means to rapidly detect and characterise multiple species simultaneously without the need to isolate individual specimens from a complex mixture, has less emphasis on specialist morphological expertise and presence of good quality samples, and offers the opportunity to detect trace levels of environmental DNA (eDNA) from low biomass samples.
The most common technique used to characterise the complex genetic diversity within an environmental sample is termed ‘DNA metabarcoding’ and involves PCR-based enrichment of a taxonomically informative gene termed a ‘barcode’ using universal primers for a single taxonomic group [5,6]. While detection of the microbiome (bacteria, fungi, viruses and archaea) is often termed ‘Microbial Forensics’, and provides a strong foundation for the integration of DNA metabarcoding analysis to forensic science [7], eDNA is an extension of this concept which encompasses higher level taxonomic groups including plants (including pollen and diatoms) and invertebrates, which are also useful indicators in forensic ecology. As most environmental sample types (such as plant fragments, soil and water) contain a high biomass, detection and characterisation of the eDNA within these samples is relatively straight forward using MPS. However, the sensitivity of this technology now offers the opportunity to push the boundaries of forensic ecology and explore the use of eDNA from low biomass samples such as dust, as well as the biological signals present on the surface of objects which previously was not feasible.
Trace amounts of eDNA can be transferred to objects via air when exposed to a particular environment [4] or transferred from an individual by touch or when two items come into contact. As a result, surfaces possess an eDNA signal that reflects that particular interaction, though present at very low levels in comparison to high biomass samples such as soils. For example, geographically distinct microbiome signals have been detected from dust, air and surface samples across different households [[8], [9], [10], [11]], offices [12,13], and subway networks [14], and airborne pollen signals have also been detected using MPS [15,16]. Such signals could prove useful in casework to identify an individual, identify the source of an unknown sample or to track the movement of individuals. MPS has repeatedly demonstrated highly discriminative, and informative signals from high biomass and low biomass environmental samples, and has been explored in a forensic context for soil discrimination [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]] and provenance assignment [[23], [24], [25], [26]], post-mortem interval estimations (time since death) [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]], human identification [[34], [35], [36], [37], [38]], body tissue identification [39], sexual assault [40,41], as well as wildlife forensic science [42] and detection of agents used in potential terrorism such as anthrax [[43], [44], [45], [46]].
Despite forensic MPS studies demonstrating the feasibility and potential of eDNA as a robust tool to fully utilise environmental trace evidence [7,28,47,48], integration into casework is challenging. Environmental DNA is a novel tool that combines DNA profiling with forensic ecology, both of which apply different approaches to evaluate and report evidence. Here, we review recent key developments in the most explored areas of forensic eDNA that are leading the integration of this MPS tool into casework with a focus on the use of eDNA for linking a suspect to a scene or establishing provenance of an unknown sample. We introduce novel areas of forensic ecology that could also benefit from these tools and discuss the current limitations and the recommended validation framework outlined for microbial forensics which is equally applicable to all aspects of trace eDNA to achieve translation into casework.
