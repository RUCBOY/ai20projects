For over a century, worldwide law enforcement has placed a high premium on the value of fingerprint evidence in terms of individual recognition and forensic analysis. For the purpose of criminal investigation, enhancing the visibility of latent fingerprints or other human traces is always at the top of the collection of physical evidence at crime scenes. As a result, a variety of approaches for latent fingerprint enhancement have been developed by forensic scientists, including regular powder, fluorescent powder, cyanoacrylate fuming, ninhydrin method, 1,8-diazafluoren-9-one method, and small particle reagent method. In consideration of its portability, high efficiency and easy operation, powder dusting is the most pervasive method for enhancing latent fingerprints worldwide [1], [2]. Although the heat of rare earth-based powders represented by down-conversion [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], up-conversion [9], [10], [11] and long afterglow nanophosphors [12], [13] has lasted for several years in forensic science, the dust blowing issue of the powder dusting method has been denounced for a long time, which poses a potential threat to the health of users. Accordingly, magnetic powders, which can be used to control the amount of powder with the aid of magnetic brushes, are generally considered one of the most effective means to avoid or slash dust blowing risk. Unfortunately, traditional magnetic powders for latent fingerprint enhancement are usually nonfluorescent, which curbs the ridge signal and thus the contrast of fingerprints, especially on multicolor substrates or textures. In addition, commercial fluorescent powders are mostly hybrids and usually contain organic dyes as luminescent ingredients and other regular powders to maintain the flowability for powder brushing. Consequently, the huge discrepancy in particle shape and size of the hybrid powders could play a negative role in the adhesion of powders and fingerprint residues, eventually cutting down the detection sensitivity as well as selectivity of latent fingerprints. Therefore, there is an urgent requirement for developing a novel powder with multifunctionality, low toxicity, and high effectiveness in forensic science.
It is a long-standing topic to protect the health of users by utilizing the controllability of superparamagnetic powder such as Fe3O4 or other iron oxide nanoparticles. In recent years, quantum dots (QDs), noble metal nanoclusters (NMNCs) and rare earth luminescent materials (RELMs) with magnetic properties have been reported as effective probes for latent fingerprint enhancement [14], [15] and many other scopes, such as bioimaging [16], immunoassays [17], [18], [19], magnetic separation [20], [21], [22], drug transport [23], [24], [25] and ion detection [26], [27]. Nevertheless, the toxicity of cadmium and the high cost of noble metals or rare earths still hinder the practical application of QDs, NMNCs or RELMs in crime scenes.
Fluorescent carbon dots (CDs), which are well known for their excellent optical properties, facile surface modification, low toxicity, and low cost of raw materials [28], have shown a great deal of interesting applications in bioimaging [29], [30], [31], [32], medical therapy [33], [34], [35], [36], photocatalysis [37], [38], [39], photodevices [40], [41], [42], [43], detecting & sensors [44], [45], [46] and light communication [47], [48] and so on. Since the first application of CD-based nanopowders for fingerprint recovery was reported by D. Fernandes and his coworkers [49], [50], many followers have successfully employed CD-based solutions [51], [52], [53] or powders [54], [55], [56], [57], [58] for detecting latent fingerprints in the last several years. On the one hand, CD-based solutions for latent fingerprint enhancement usually require longer incubation times, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of on-site rapid processing. On the other hand, because the synthesis method of high solid-state fluorescence of CDs in powdery form at present is still limited, CD-based powders used in latent fingerprint enhancement are nonmagnetic, which still remains a risk to use health. Accordingly, although these newly emerging strategies have exhibited potential in forensic science, there are no reports about magnetic fluorescent CDs and their user-secure application in latent fingerprint enhancement.
Herein, an ingenious and fast synthesis of Fe3O4@SiO2-CD(n) powder possessing moderate magnetic and photoluminescence characteristics was proposed. The negatively charged CDs were prepared using gelatin as the carbon source and ethanediol as the dispersing agent, which exhibited bright blue emission under 365Â nm irradiation. To endow the as-prepared CDs with magnetism, a layer-by-layer assembly route was devised using a cationic surfactant as an electrostatic adsorbent for binding the negatively charged CDs together. The fluorescence intensity and quantum yield of the Fe3O4@SiO2-CD(n) powder were basically comparable with those of pure CDs. The moderate magnetism of this bifunctional product enabled magnetic separation in the process of synthesis and fingerprint detection with a magnetic brush. Moreover, the abundant carboxyl and hydroxy groups as well as the negative charge on the surface of Fe3O4@SiO2-CD(n) provide potentially enhanced covalent or electrostatic binding between fingerprint residues and the composite powder (Fig. 1). Therefore, an ingenious and fast synthetic route was presented for CD-based composite powder combining high fluorescence and moderate magnetic properties, which has been demonstrated as a user-secure and efficient approach for latent fingerprint enhancement.Download : Download high-res image (417KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.
