With the rapid growth of digital data communication over the Internet, there is a growing concern about the security of digital data. Digital data may be in the form of text, images, audio or video. Security of digital data is a major concern during its storage, as well as communication. Several methods such as image hiding (steganography), digital watermarking and encryption have been proposed in the literature to increase the security of digital data. These techniques, however, give rise to a new problem of a single point of failure and are inherent to tampering. The steganography and digital watermarking techniques use carrier data to provide security to the digital data. Lossless recovery of the digital data thus becomes impossible in case of modification or loss of the carrier data. Moreover, recent advancement in steganalysis, such as that proposed by Yang et al. [1], poses a major security concern for these techniques. Similarly, in the encryption of digital data, recovery becomes impossible in the case of loss of the decryption key. To solve this single point of failure problem, duplicates can be maintained in these methods. However, this solution compromises the security of data by increasing its risk of exposure. Towards improving the security of digital data while eliminating the single point of failure problem, a large number of Secret Sharing Schemes (SSS) [2] have been put forward and analyzed in the literature. When the data in question is image data, these schemes are referred to as Secret Image Sharing (SIS) schemes [3].
Thien et al. [3] offered the pioneering SIS scheme based on the SSS proposed by Shamir [2]. Each share of the Secret Image (SI) in this scheme is called as the shadow image. The scheme by Thien et al. [3] reduced the size of the shadow image as compared to the trivial application of Shamir’s SSS [2] to a SI, wherein the shadow image size is the same as the size of the SI being shared. Thereafter, a large number of SIS schemes have been proposed [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] each focusing on improving various aspects such as the shadow image size, information-theoretic security, computation required for SI reconstruction and nature of the shadow images. Of these, the shadow image size is a crucial property as it determines the communication overhead incurred in transmission of the share and also the storage required at each shareholder.
Organization of the paperRest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 motivates this work followed by an enumeration of our contributions. In Section 3, we briefly analyze the existing SIS schemes. The proposed SIS scheme is outlined in Section 4. In Section 4.3, an improvement over the scheme proposed in Section 4 is discussed. Section 5 provides the security analysis of the proposed scheme. In Section 6, we describe the experimental setup and the results obtained on sample images. Finally, the conclusion is provided in Section 7.
