Ammonia (NH3) is a toxic and colorless gas with a pungent odor, easily found in farms, petrochemical facilities, and medical facilities [1]. It is essential to monitor the NH3 in industrial chemistry or agricultural environments because this poisonous gas could impair the human immune system and do harm to the body [2]. Its permissible maximum concentration and exposure time is 35 ppm for 10 min. [3]. Moreover, medical research shows that NH3 (sub-ppm level) in human respiratory gas is an important biomarker for auxiliary diagnosis of some diseases, including liver cirrhosis, renal failure, and duodenal ulcer [4,5]. Hence, the gas sensors for detecting the low concentration of NH3 have been in high demand for preventing NH3 overexposure accidents or human health-warning.
Over the last decade or so, NH3 sensors based on solid-state electrolytes and metal-oxide semiconductors have attracted considerable attention because of their advantages of simple operation, good chemical stability, and low-cost production [6,7]. However, most above sensors do not support bending operation. In addition to that, they have a shortage of high working temperatures, which impedes these sensors applied in wearable smart devices for real-time testing human breath or monitoring the surrounding environment [8]. Hence, it is imperative to develop flexible room temperature NH3 sensors with high sensitivity, good stability, and low-cost fabrication.
Recently, conducting conjugated polymers have been extensively studied and demonstrated as gas-sensing materials to detect NH3 at ambient temperature [9]. Polyaniline (PANI), as one of the most common conducting polymers, has attracted substantial interest in NH3 detection due to its reversible doping/dedoping property and adjustable NH3 sensing characteristics at ambient temperature [10]. Pure PANI, however, shows a limited sensitivity to the low concentration of NH3 gas. For example, lately, N.S. Harale prepared a nanofibrous PANI film with an 8% response towards 5 ppm NH3 [11], and L. Kumar fabricated a pure PANI sensor with a 25% response towards 5 ppm NH3 [12]. It is an efficient method to further enhance the PANI based sensor response to NH3 by mixing different nanomaterials, such as graphene, carbon nanotubes, or metal oxides [[13], [14], [15]].
In our previous work, we found that Poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PSS) is the main part of adsorbing ammonia in the sensor with PEDOT: PSS as the sensitive material [16], and pure PANI on polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) substrate shows a good response to NH3 [17]. As an extension of our previous work, this study attempted to prepare a particular structure of the PSS-PANI/PANI composite film sensor with more active sites on its surface further to enhance the response to NH3 at ambient temperature. Hence, this paper describes a flexible porous PSS-PANI/PVDF based film sensor produced by a facile in-suit polymerization method. The film’s sensing properties to NH3 (0.1∼10 ppm) were demonstrated at room temperature. Furthermore, the influences of doped-PSS amounts, relative humidity (RH), bending radius, and operating temperature on the film sensors’ sensing performance were investigated in detail. This research offers new light on the highly efficient NH3 sensing materials for potential applications in real-time NH3 detection or human health-warning.
