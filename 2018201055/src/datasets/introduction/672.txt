Many real-world applications, such as industrial scheduling [1], controller design [2], and design optimization [3], often have multiple objectives that are in conflict with one another. Without loss of generality, multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) can be modeled as follows:(1)MinimizeF(x)=(f1(x),f2(x),…,fM(x))Subject to:x∈Xwhere X is the feasible decision (variable) space (here in D dimensions) and fi(x),i=1,2,…,M are the objectives to be optimized. When the objective functions are in conflict it is not possible to define a single optimal solution, but a set of non-dominated solutions instead, which is known as Pareto optimal set (PS) in the decision space. The image in objective space of the Pareto optimal set under F(·) is known as the Pareto front (PF). The main goal of multi-objective optimization is to find a set of solutions whose objective vectors form a uniformly distributed non-dominated set as close as possible to the PF. Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] has garnered widespread attention because of its capability to find multiple tradeoff solutions simultaneously [10], [4], [6], [11]. However, it is often difficult to obtain good approximations to the Pareto set when problems have four or more objectives. Such problems are called many-objective problems (MaOPs) [12], and the issue with solving them stems from the loss of selection pressure [13] in high-dimensional objective spaces (which causes nearly all solutions to be incomparable with each other under a Pareto dominance comparison) [14].
Generally speaking, evolutionary optimization algorithms for many-objective problems can be divided into dominance based multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) [15], [16], decomposition based MOEAs [17], [18], [19], [20], and performance indicator-based MOEAs [21], [22], [23]. As indicated in [3], [8], dominance based MOEAs lose selection pressure significantly in environmental selection because the number of non-dominated individuals increases dramatically when the dimension of the objective space increases [24], [25], [26]. Therefore, the environmental selection behaves akin to a random selection process. This results in a final population whose members are distributed widely over the objective space but, which objective vectors lying far from the desired PF [27]. The straightforward way for confronting this problem is to modify the Pareto dominance relation. Some interesting attempts include loosening the dominance condition or dominance relation, such as α-dominance [28], and dominance area control [29]. These parameterized dominance relations are able to provide sufficient selection pressure towards the Pareto front. However, a crucial aspect of such methods is determining a priori an appropriate value of the parameter which determines the relaxation degree. This has been highlighted as an area needing further research [30]. For decomposition-based MOEAs, [24] shows that their performance strongly depends on the shape of the Pareto front. Hence the choice of their reference vectors is particularly important to achieve a good performance. However, as the dimension of the objective space increases, it is difficult to divide the objective space evenly into sub-objective spaces. Furthermore, it is also difficult to adapt the distribution of search directions when the Pareto front is irregular. In performance indicator approaches, such as the hypervolume (HV) [7] and R2 indicator [31], a fitness value is assigned to each individual based on the indicator before environmental selection. These approaches are popular as because both HV and R2 are able to account for convergence and diversity in parallel. For example, HyPE [21] and SMS-MOEA [7] use the hypervolume to evaluate the convergence and diversity of a solution. Unfortunately however, the computation of the hypervolume indicator can be relatively time-consuming compared to the other operations required during optimization, especially when the number of objectives is large. Recently, Li et al. [32] utilized the stochastic ranking technique to balance the search biases of different indicators. Tian et al. [33] developed an improved inverted generational distance indicator and designed a strategy to adaptively alter the reference vectors according to the indicator contributions of candidate solutions in an external archive. Sun et al. [23] proposed using IGD for environmental selection. Zhou et al. [34] designed a co-guided MaOEA (many-objective evolutionary optimizer) and used an indicator together with reference points to evaluate the convergence and diversity of the solutions. A promising-region based MaOEA with the ratio based indicator was proposed in [35], in which a ratio based indicator with infinite norm was used to identify the promising region and the parallel distance was adopted to select individuals in the promising region to ensure the diversity of the population.
In the evolutionary process, the contributions to convergence and the diversity performances of some solutions may be in conflict with one other, i.e., where many solutions might be located close to ideal (optimal) objective combinations, those solutions with good convergence may collectively have poor diversity. Therefore, in this paper, we regard the convergence performance and diversity performance as two separate objectives. A new population is selected according to non-dominated sorting on these two objectives. Note that although often the case, convergence and diversity are not required to be in conflict with each other. If both convergence and diversity are good, the individual will be definitely be in the first front. Relatedly, Li et al. [36] also proposed to convert a many-objective problem into a bi-goal problem encompassing proximity and diversity, called BiGE. In BiGE, the summation of all elements of F(x) is taken as the first objective, and the crowding degree calculated niching is the second objective used for environmental selection. As the first objective compresses together all the values in the original objectives, this can lead to the loss of some important individuals, such as the extreme solutions of a convex Pareto front, or the solutions in the center of a concave Pareto front. Similarly, most existing convergence performance indicators are based only on the distance to the ideal or nadir point, which may also result in the loss of such solutions. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new convergence measure, which tries to balance the convergence performance of the solutions on the boundaries and in the center of the approximated Pareto front. For the diversity performance, we propose to use the angle to measure the degree of crowdedness between individuals, which has been shown more precise than the Euclidean distance in high-dimensional objective space [17]. In contrast, in BiGE [36] the diversity of solution is evaluated by a niching technique, which requires the setting of an additional parameter. The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:
1.A new method to measure of convergence performance is proposed, which makes use of both an ideal point and a nadir point to balance the convergence performance of individuals that are located in different regions of the objective space.2.The angle between an individual and its closest neighbour, is used as the diversity performance as an objective to be maximized together with the convergence performance for guiding the search.3.The effectiveness of contributions 1) and 2) are evaluated on a range of well-known test problems, and shown to be competitive with state-of-the-art methods, particularly for many-objective problem instances.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a detailed description of our proposed approach, named non-dominated sorting on performance indicators for evolutionary many-objective optimization (NSPI-EMO). The performance of the experimental results on DTLZ and MaF test problems are presented and analyzed in Section 3. Section 4 summarises the paper and outlines future work leading on from this study.
