Life chemistry constitutes one of the most stimulating scientific borders. Despite the fascinating theoretical and experimental chemical, biochemical and electrochemical advances flourishing during the last century, the theoretical description of biological functions (and diseases) remains beyond the limits of present chemical and physical models. If the scientific community agrees that life and biological functions are based on bio-electrochemical reactions the question is, which aspects of those reactions have not been considered yet?
1.1. Macromolecular electro-chemical motors and muscular actuationMost of the biological functions are based on the chemical or electrochemical actuation of macromolecular motors: the reaction drives conformational (mechanical) movements of the reacting macromolecules. In this review our interest is focused on the replication of the functions linked to natural muscles: the actuation of any natural muscle from mammals involves a circuit constituted by the brain (or the sympathetic nervous system), a motor neuron, the muscle and a sensory neuron (Fig. 1a) [1]. Despite the great complexity of the reactions taking place in a muscle cell our goal are the basic elements originating the muscle functionality. The brain generates the contraction order send as an electrical energetic signal (nervous pulse) through the motor neuron to the muscle. Calcium ions (electro-chemical signal) are liberated inside the sarcomere triggering the cooperative actuation of chemical macromolecular motors [e.g. actin-myosin-adenosine triphosphate(ATP)] from the cell [2,3]. A sensing signal is generated during the muscle actuation sending back to the brain through the sensory neuron a nervous pulse translating quantitative information about the mechanical (relative position, movement rate, trailed mass or obstacles in the way), chemical (tiredness state) and thermal working conditions (Fig. 1a). The brain treats all this information generating new actuation orders to adjust the movement. The simultaneous and parallel control by brain of the ensemble of the mammal actuating muscles originates mechanical proprioception. The mammal brain is aware at any time of: the relative position and movement rate of all and each part of his body, the presence of trailed objects, the fatigue state of the muscles and the working temperature [4], [5], [6], [7].Download : Download high-res image (379KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. (a) Natural muscular system, brain/motor neuron (bleu)-sensory neuron (red)/muscle, and replicating artificial muscular system: computer-potentiostat/two connecting wires/artificial triple layer muscle. The motor neuron drives the brain actuating orders (nervous energetic pulses) to the muscle and the sensory neuron drives to the brain quantitative information about the muscle mechanical, chemical and thermal working conditions. (b) Artificial system including a triple layer, conducting polymer(black)/tape (yellow)/conducting polymer (black) artificial muscle: the two wires connecting the muscle to the potentiostat include, at any time, flowing current (movement rate, Eq. 5), consumed charge (muscle position, Eq. 6) and consumed reaction energy giving quantitative information to the computer about: trailed mass and obstacles, chemical and thermal working conditions (Eq. 11). Natural and artificial systems work driven by macromolecular motors sensing, simultaneously, all the working conditions: multi-sensing motors. Reproduced from reference [249] with permission from Elsevier.Thus the muscle contraction (volume variation) involves the chemical consumption of ATP to give adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate providing the energy required to drive the conformational (mechanical) movement of the actin-myosin macromolecular motors. During the reaction (muscle actuation) a sensing signal is produced (the origin still unknown) to inform the brain about the working mechanical, thermal and chemical conditions: natural muscles are self-multi-sensing (haptic) motors [5,8]. Summarizing, triggered by an electric signal (the nervous pulse) sent by the brain, the chemical energy stored in ATP ions is transformed to mechanical energy, sensing signals and heat by cooperative actuation (reaction) of the macromolecular motors from the muscle cells originating the muscle contraction. Natural muscles from living creatures are electro-chemical macroscopic multi-sensing-motors working under constant (that of the body) temperature, far away from the Carnot's low efficiency servitude of nowadays-artificial thermal motors consuming chemical fuels and working in a temperature gradient [9,10].At the moment it doesn't exist any artificial motor sensing by itself (not requiring separate sensors) the working physical and chemical conditions. Replicating such natural self-multi-sensing motors is one of the oldest dreams from scientists, engineers, robot designers or behavioral scientists.
1.2. How close to natural muscles present artificial muscles are? Model materialsAt present the artificial control of the natural macromolecular machines driving the muscle actuation, if increasing very fast during the last decades [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], is far to allow the replication and study of its dual self-sensing-actuating functions.Under such challenging conditions scientists try to develop model materials that can replicate some of the different steps involved in any muscular actuation. Here the actuating macroscopic result is the muscle contraction (change of volume) being the basic elements those chemical-driven macromolecular motors constituting the intracellular matrix (ICM) dense gel of the muscle's cells. Following the above muscular description our ideal model material should be a dense gel constituted by macromolecular or polymeric motors, ions and solvent (water) responding to electric signals with reactions driving macromolecular conformational movements, ionic and solvent exchange with the surroundings originating the material volume variation (contraction/expansion).At the moment a plethora of dry and gel materials (inorganic and organic) respond to electric signals replicating the macroscopic muscular volume variation (piezoelectric, ferroelectric, electrostrictive). Some of them include ionic and osmotic movements (coulombic, electrophoretic, electroosmotic,) inside the material [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]. They originate electro-mechanical (physical) actuators, also named artificial muscles in the literature. They do not include any chemical or electrochemical reaction. Thus, if very interesting from a technological point of view allowing during the last century the development of hundreds of electro-mechanical actuators, none of them looks suitable to replicate dual and simultaneous multi-sensing-actuation from natural muscles, which looks linked to the involved electro-chemical reaction driving the muscular actuation.On the other hand, films constituted by redox and conducting polymers [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], carbon nanotubes, graphenes, [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46] and other organic materials respond to electric pulses in liquid electrolytes following electrochemical reactions of the constitutive macromolecular or polymeric chain units driving conformational movements (macromolecular motors), ionic exchange with the ambient for charge balance, solvent exchange for osmotic balance and volume variations (contraction or expansion). Those controlled (Faradaic) volume variations also have been used to develop artificial muscles [21,[47], [48], [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59], [60], [61], [62]]. They are electro-chemo-mechanical actuators: we will review here how during actuation they replicate both, composition (dense gels) and each of the steps involved in natural muscles, including chemical reactions driving the constitutive macromolecular motors. Thus, any material electrode from the above-mentioned families of electroactive materials could be taken as a model material of the intracellular matrix (ICM) active parts of the muscular cells. Here we will explore how and why those materials open a new scientific window to describe and quantify many muscular properties as multi-sensing or self-awareness and to construct self-awareness artificial tools and robots provided with some primitive proprioception.Unfortunately, from the bio-replication point of view, instead of the clearest classification of artificial muscles driven by electric pulses as: physical (electro-mechanical) and chemical (electro-chemo-mechanical) driven muscles [47,63] most of the literature uses the confusing division into electronic and ionic artificial muscles [22,[64], [65], [66]]. Consequently most of the artificial muscles driven by electrochemical reactions are claimed in the literature, and treated theoretically (describing stress and strain variations), as ionic electro-mechanical devices [51,[67], [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], [77], [78], [79], [80], [81], [82], [83]] including the driving reaction as a complementary theoretical aspect. Describing self-sensing properties is outside their goals.
