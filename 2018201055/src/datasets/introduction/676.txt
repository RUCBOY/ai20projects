Computer aided utensil fragment reassembly is a challenging and interesting issue. It can provide technical support for many research fields, e.g., computer aided archaeology [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], computer aided bone fracture reduction [7], [8], [9] and so on. Obviously, for fragment reassembly, the most important issue is automatic and accurate feature fracture surface extraction (segmentation) which will directly decide the reassembly effect. Moreover, an effective alignment method for the extracted fracture surfaces also has an important influence on the fragment reassembly result. For these issues, we tried many methods. However, we found that they are not very effective for this special research aim. So designing effective computing methods for fragment reassembly is an interesting challenge. This challenge mainly includes robust fracture surface segmentation and accurate fragment alignment. In this paper, to achieve automatic utensil reassembly, our main and core contribution focuses on the fragment fracture surface segmentation. We designed a descriptor of triangular mesh local geometric feature and combined deep CNN model to accomplish the extraction of fracture surface. In order to improve the integrality of entire research work, we also designed a control-point- and vector-based strategy to achieve the matching and prealignment of the fracture surfaces and designed a cyclic error iteration strategy to assemble the fragments into a holonomic utensil.
