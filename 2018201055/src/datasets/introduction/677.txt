Kohn–Sham’s density functional theory (DFT) gives an adequate description of the ground state of weakly correlated electronic systems, but it provides only a rough estimate of their excited states. The latter can be treated by many body techniques, of which Hedin’s GW approximation [1] is the first necessary step because it provides quasi electrons and quasi holes with residual interactions. In the next step, one may then study excitonic features by using the Bethe–Salpeter method [2], [3], [4]. In non magnetic semiconductors, the GW approximation gives fairly accurate results [5], [6] for the transport gap that is closely related to the open circuit voltage of photovoltaic cells [7].
The GW approximation and its success in describing the fundamental gaps of weakly correlated semiconductors has been reviewed in great detail [8], [9], [10], [11]. While the method is successful where it can be applied, it is also known to be computationally difficult for semiconductors with a large number of atoms in their unit cell. This is because in most implementations of the GW approximation the needed CPU scales rather steeply, as O(N4), with the number N of atoms in the unit cell which may lead to computations taking months on a supercomputer [12].
The situation is more favorable in the “space time approach” to the GW approximation [13], [14] where CPU time scales as O(N3) and there is also a promising stochastic implementation of GW [15], [16], where the needed CPU time scales only linearly as O(N). Unfortunately, this latter method has given no results, so far, for periodic systems that are our focus here.
There are also methods where one parametrizes the response in an effective way [17], [18], [19], but in these computational approaches CPU time scales again as O(N4). The GW method works fairly well for molecules [20], [21], [22], [23] but we focus here on periodic bulk systems, where the situation is much less satisfactory.
Because of its favorable O(N3) scaling, the space time method would be the natural choice for semiconductors with hundreds of atoms in their unit cell, except that it suffers from a “memory bottleneck” because entire correlation functions must be written into the computer memory at intermediate stages of the computation. A few years ago, Kaltak et al. [24] and Liu et al. [25] made important progress by lowering the number of frequencies in the imaginary time correlation functions. This reduced the needed memory enough for the resulting code to run on special purpose computers.
The aim of the present paper is to show that the screened Coulomb interaction W that enters the self-energy Σ=iGW of the GW approximation may be expanded in waves that satisfy Nyquist’s condition in each of their three components, see Eq. (10) further below. This reduces the needed memory by a factor of 26=64 and it also reduces the CPU time of the construction of W by a factor of 83=512. These reductions of both memory and CPU time by several orders of magnitude move the space time approach to GW from special purpose machines to more widely available laptops and work stations. Our method should also facilitate the study of organic semiconductors that have many atoms in their unit cell.
The remaining sections of this paper are organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce a “Nyquist approximation” to the GW equations. In Section 3 we describe our algorithm. In Section 4 we test our method on a few semiconductors. Our conclusions are given in Section 5.
