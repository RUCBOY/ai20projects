Degree–based invariants belong to one of the largest and heavily investigated classes of topological molecular descriptors. One of the first indices that appeared in science is belonging to this particular particular class [1]. Randić index is probably the best-known representative of degree–based molecular descriptors [2]. Countless papers and several books are devoted to the chemical and mathematical properties of this index (e.g. see [3], [4], [5], [6] and references cited therein). Induced by the success of the Randić index, many descriptors have been developed as its modifications and/or extensions.
The geometric–arithmetic index was introduced more than ten years ago [7] as an attempt to outperform the predictive ability of the Randić index. It has shown a reasonable applicability potential in QSPR and related fields. The geometric–arithmetic index is defined as follows: Let G be a simple connected graph with n=|V(G)| vertices and m=|E(G)| edges. Then,(1)GA(G)=∑uv∈E(G)2dudvdu+dv.where du and dv are the degrees of end-vertices of an edge uv .
Chemical usefulness and mathematical features of the GA(G) attracted scientists to investigate it thoroughly (e.g. [8], [9], [10]).
The summand ga(e)=2dudvdu+dv in (1) is the contribution of the edge e=uv to GA(G) and it is the ratio between the geometric and arithmetic means of du and dv. Swapping the arithmetic and geometric means in the above mentioned ratio gives ag(e)=du+dv2dudv, and it immediately derive us a new measure that is called as the arithmetic–geometric index, abbreviated as AG(G),(2)AG(G)=∑e=uv∈E(G)ag(e)=∑e=uv∈Edu+dv2dudv.
The arithmetic–geometric index was firstly appeared in [11], where authors calculated its value for the path graphs. This article was followed by several other papers [12], [13], [14] of the same authors, where they considered some elementary and rather easy obtainable features of the AG(G) . In [15], the arithmetic–geometric index was for the first time seriously treated. Moreover, the symmetric matrix, which elements are ag(e) was used for introducing the so-called arithmetic–geometric energy of a graph [16], [17].
In this paper, we firstly present some lower and upper bounds for trees, connected graphs and connected bipartite graphs. Then, we are characterizing chemical trees that maximize the value of arithmetic–geometric index. Finally, the relations between the AG(G) and its predecessor GA(G) are elaborated.
Let’s start with the following observation:
Since the term ag(e) in (2) is the contribution of the edge e=uv to AG(G), it is called the AG-contribution or shortly the contribution of edge e. In the same manner we call ga(e) the GA-contribution. As the arithmetic mean is at least big as the geometric mean, we haveag(e)≥1≥ga(e)with equality only if du=dv. Then,Observation 1For every graph GAG(G)≥GA(G)with equality only if G is regular.
