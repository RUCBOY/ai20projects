Image encryption as an important topic for information security [1], [2], [3] has been evolved from early classical Fourier transform to numerous variations. Such effort was started from double random-phase encoding (DRPE) [4] where random phase masks based on input plane and Fourier plane for encryption of the images. Subsequently, many new encryption methods such as fractional Fourier transform [5], Fresnel transform [6], fractional wavelet transform [7], fractional Mellin transform [8], gyrator transform [9], Hartley transform [10], Arnold transform [11] have also been developed. While the progress is significant, all these methods are rather inefficient especially for high volume of image processing. Typically, these methods can only process one image at the time. Yet the request for larger volume based image encryption is clear such as real time manufacturing industry. It further motivates us to develop new methodology for meeting this goal.
Among the new methods developed, the following methods including wavelength multiplexing [12], position multiplexing [13], angular multiplexing [14], phase mask multiplexing [15], topological charge number multiplexing [16], digital holography [17], ghost imaging [18], compressed sensing [19] have all shown promising progresses. The following research are a particular interest of multiple image encryption. Zhao proposed a multiple-image encryption method based on Fresnel phase position multiplexing, but a small amount of cross-talk noise can be generated when multiple images are decrypted [20]. Wan presented a multiple-image encryption method based on compressed holography, which used a modified Mach-Zehnder interferometer, including multi-channel optical interference, and each image acts as a secret key of other images to achieve the mutual encryption [21]. This method overcame the noise crosstalk through the decryption process. Later on, Xu proposed a multiple-image encryption scheme based on digital holography and random amplitude mask, but its disadvantage is that the amount of encrypted images is limited for the purpose of reducing the crosstalk noise [22]. For continuation of the improvement of encryption strength, Xi introduced an optical multiple-image based on angle multiplexing and computer generated hologram. The main innovation of the research involves using multiple image encryption keys which can improve the security of this scheme [23]. More recently, Yang proposed a multiple-image encryption use of compressed coded aperture imaging method, which only uses one main original random matrix key to encrypt multiple images to improve the encryption efficiency [24].
In this research, we propose a new multiple-image encryption method based on quick response (QR) code and elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). This innovative approach relies on elliptic curve cryptography for the security of the encryption system and quick response code ensures the capacity of the encryption system. In this scheme, four original images are converted into four quick response codes with strong anti-noise ability, and then four quick response codes and a randomly generated security key are superimposed on one image by using the modified Mach–Zehnder interferometer. Finally, elliptic curve cryptography is used to encrypt the superimposed image and the random key, and two encrypted ciphertexts can be obtained, in which the encryption key is a randomly generated matrix. The advantage of using elliptic curve cryptography is that it is asymmetric, therefore the security of the encryption scheme is higher than the symmetric counterpart. Compared with the traditional optical encryption system, our optical system has the following advantages. First, it encrypts multiple images without any crosstalk noise. Second, the encrypted ciphertext is a real value rather than a complex number, which can be further processed or analyzed for the consequent tasks. Third, due to the involvement of non-interference technique, it does not require high precision of optical system setup in comparison to the interference based techniques. In addition, the encryption system has a large fault tolerance, which effectively resist occlusion attack, noise attack, and can encrypt up to 16 images simultaneously which has great potential in user multiplexing and large image encryption/decryption.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce our cryptosystem and computer simulation results in detail. In Section 3, we prove the security of our encryption system and the ability to resist multiple attacks. In Section 4, the conclusion and discussion are showed.
