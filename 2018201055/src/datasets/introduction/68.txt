Sustainable Development Goal 14, launched in 2015 by the United Nations, calls to protect marine and coastal environments, ensuring the provision of ecosystem services for the future [1]. Accordingly, scientifically-informed and effective marine management and conservation policies need adequate information about ecosystems [2], [3], coherence [4] and public support for successful implementation [5]. The dependence on specialized and expensive logistics to obtain data poses particular challenges for marine research. This is especially true in the conservation context, where good data with sufficient spatio-temporal resolution are rarely available [6]. Scientific knowledge is critical for the support of policy design in developing countries [7], yet it is often lacking and is slow to accumulate. To increase the speed and volume of new ecological data, local volunteers can support natural resource monitoring, especially when data collection is difficult due to limited budgets or other constraints [3].
Data collection and effective implementation of management and conservation policy, benefit from community support and public engagement [8], [9]. To achieve sustainable policies and practices, trust between community members, decision-makers and managers is essential [10]. The shift towards more participatory decision-making is important for policy design that improves environmental management [9], and public participation can enhance the quality of policies and decision-making by considering more comprehensive inputs by diverse stakeholders [11], [12], [13], [14]. Including a wide range of participants in the process is considered important for sound policies and management success [15], but imposes a range of challenges on participatory projects [16]. Involving diverse stakeholders in the policy design and management process bring benefits such as a breadth of experiences and knowledge, which represents multiple perspectives, and promotes adaptability in decision-making [16].
Citizen Science projects are participatory activities that aim to get citizens involved in science-related processes, mainly in observational and monitoring activities [17]. This type of public participation in the scientific process has important benefits not only for research, but also in the context of resource management and conservation [8], [10], [18]. Involving stakeholders from the beginning has been emphasized as essential for achieving high-quality management [11], [19]. In this way, citizen science represents an ideal strategy to engage stakeholders in generating marine policy baselines by collaboratively identifying research questions, monitoring biodiversity or considering potential barriers to acceptance and compliance with rules and policies. Citizen science also has social benefits such as the democratization of science, increase in scientific literacy, or better relationships between communities and management agencies, among others [17], [20], [21]. For citizen science to provide beneficial support for policy and environmental management, it is important that diverse stakeholders are involved [8], [10], [22], yet recruitment and retention of different groups remains an important challenge for citizen science [20], [23], [24].
Marine Citizen Science (MCS)1 has undergone important developments during the past decade, with programs proliferating globally [21]. It has been considered an important avenue towards achieving marine citizenship, through which citizens have become informed and engaged in marine policy and sustainability [25], [26]. Despite logistical and skill requirements for participants in many projects, MCS has expanded and contributed to high-quality scientific research [21], [23], [27], [28]. Collaborations between divers and scientists in MCS have shown valuable information can be generated through participant’s observations and their local ecological knowledge [29], [30], [31], [32]. Studies that cover large spatiotemporal scales [33], [34], search for cryptic species [20], or record rare observations [20], [21], have benefited from MCS. Many MCS projects collaborate with recreational SCUBA divers who dive for leisure. However, there is a wide range of other groups who dive for different reasons, mostly for their livelihood. For example, commercial divers work on sub-marine buildings or infrastructure, fishers harvest marine resources underwater, dive instructors teach or guide recreational divers, and scientific divers conduct research activities. This diversity of divers offers great potential for MCS to target the information needs of different marine management and conservation issues. Gaining insights on how to engage these diverse stakeholders in a meaningful way is critical, without which the potential of MSC to inform marine policy is limited.
Most research on factors that determine divers’ participation has focused on actual participants in MCS projects [35]. There are only few studies focusing on potential participants (i.e. those who have never participated in MCS projects). Pioneering studies [36], [37], [38] evaluated the interests of marine users (including SCUBA divers) and barriers to MCS participation in Australia. Lucrezi et al. [23] conducted a comprehensive study with divers around the Mediterranean Sea, in which they interviewed divers who had participated in MCS as well as those who had never engaged in a MCS project. They found most divers are well disposed towards involvement in MCS. Hermoso et al. [39] also evaluated motivations and preferences of different diver types (e.g. artisanal fishers, recreational divers), revealing that important differences in their profile can influence their participation in MCS.
The existing body of knowledge suggests that diving experience plays an important role in determining the extent to which divers are interested and participate in MCS. For example, Cerrano et al. [35] found that people with greater diving experience contribute more to MCS. Similarly, Arvanitidis et al. [40] and Lucrezi et al. [23] concluded that more experienced divers have a greater interest in MCS. In addition, education level (and education in science) has also been related to the interest level or participation of volunteers in MCS [38], [41]. The relationship between diving experience, knowledge of the marine environment, and commitment to a MCS project is particularly relevant, but the underlying factors that affect this relationship are still not well understood.
The Recreational Specialization Theory [42] can help to explain the relationships between diving experience and knowledge of the marine environment with participation in MCS. This theory posits that an individual participating in a sport will pass through a “continuum of behavior from the general to the particular, reflected by equipment and skills used in the sport and activity setting preferences” [42]. In this way, a more specialized participant could have different motivations, preferences, or behaviors than others who are less specialized. Although this theory has been developed in the context of outdoor recreational activities, some researchers have suggested it could be applied to other types of leisure activities and in the professional context [43], [44]. For example, preferences for particular resource management regulations differ among anglers with different specialization levels [14]. This theory has also been useful for diving tourism management [45], [46].
Diving specialization has been successfully applied in studies of recreational SCUBA divers where it helped to predict underwater behavior of divers, or to explain knowledge and attitudes about the marine environment [43], [44], [47], [48], [49]. Specialization can be a complex process that varies among individuals and groups based on experiences or even socio-cultural factors [50]. In this study, we use this general framework to describe the specialization level of different diver types, but we do not delve into the causes of these differences in the specialization level. There are three dimensions of specialization typically used by researchers: (a) behavioral, (b) affective, and (c) cognitive [44], [46], [48]. The behavioral dimension comprises factors related to the experience in diving such as total number of dives, total years diving, and diving frequency. Affective factors are related to the affinity of people to the activity and its centrality to their lifestyle. The cognitive dimension includes factors related to the levels of skill and knowledge.
This study assesses the characteristics and engagement of different types of divers as a way to inform recruitment of diverse stakeholders to MCS projects. It specifically evaluates diving specialization levels among artisanal fishers, dive instructors, recreational divers and divers with scientific a background to understand the relationship between diving specialization level and actual participation in MCS. The findings are discussed in relation to how engaging a diversity of divers can improve the contribution of citizen science to marine management and conservation policy.
