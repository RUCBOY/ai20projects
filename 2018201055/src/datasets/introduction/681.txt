E-cigarettes, particularly pod-based devices like Juul, remain popular among youth and emerging adults [1]. One brand, Juul, encompassed 64 % of the market share in October 2019, per Nielsen all channel data for tobacco sales [2]. While marketing campaigns claim they are not specifically targeted at minors, Juul use soared among these populations, prompting public health concerns and subsequent ongoing investigations by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration [[3], [4], [5]]. The popularity of Juul use among young people is partly facilitated by its ease of use or concealment, the effect that it gives users, and use by friends [6,7]. With Juul’s rapid expansion to international markets [8], and growth of related products like disposable e-cigarettes [1], new generations of youth across the world may be at risk of dependence on nicotine products and various other negative health outcomes such as hindered brain development and long-term lung damage [9]. Furthermore, during the current times of the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence shows COVID-19 diagnosis is five times more likely among e-cigarette users [10]. Hence, it is critical to empower public health agencies and other prevention researchers with strategies for reaching youth who are currently using the product, to provide relevant information, as well as cessation messaging and support resources.
One such way could be through social media given approximately 90 % of young adults use social media and over 80 % own a smartphone [11]. There is also evidence to suggest e-cigarette manufacturers target young people through advertising on social media, which has been linked to susceptibility of initiation [12]. Several recent studies explore and characterize social media posts related to Juul use and dependence [[13], [14], [15], [16]]; however, to our knowledge, none are designed for the purpose of identifying Juul usage by consumers based on their social media feeds.
In this first of its kind study, using self-reported survey answers as ground truth, we explore the potential for using publicly available historical Twitter data, including user-specific Twitter messages (tweets) and friend and follower networks, to determine an individual’s past 30-day use of Juul. Our main intuition behind this study is based on past studies that show social media participation and associated influence can be drivers of beliefs and habits of tobacco product usage [17]. Additionally, our prior work also indicates that having friends who are also users of Juul is one of the reasons respondents cited as their motivation to try the product [6]. This effort leverages ‘friends’ on social media as a variable to assess the ability to identify current use. Additionally, Unger et al. [18] also show that explicitly talking positively about tobacco products correlates with using them in the real world. Our effort combines these ideas and uses both user generated content and follower/friend connections to identify Juul users. Unlike Unger et al.’s effort, we do not limit our focus to positive mentions of specific pre-selected tobacco terms and simply let supervised models elicit signal from tweets.
We contend that models that are able to automatically distinguish between users and non-users of Juul in a quick and inexpensive manner will benefit the development and reach of tailored prevention campaigns on social media to combat pro-use information young people are currently exposed to. Twitter specifically allows such campaigns by advertising prevention messages, clinical trial recruitment calls, or additional surveys. This way, the focus is on specific likely users of the product as opposed to traditional surveys, which target a more general audience where there may not be many users. Our data in this project pertains to University of Kentucky students and this was only possible because we had access to incoming students’ emails through official channels of the organization. This may not be practical, if we want to target other segments of population across the nation. There is ongoing research that determines the age group or life stage of a user on Twitter [19]. Our approach (specifically the model we learn to identify current users) could be used in combination with such methods to reach a wider and more diverse group of potential users across the nation.
