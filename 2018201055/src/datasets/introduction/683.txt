The construction industry is a large industry in Australia, representing approximately 8% of GDP and employs 1.2 million people [1]. As part of an audit in 2009, Infrastructure Australia [2] suggested that, because of projected increased population, there would be a greater need for investment in new and existing infrastructure. This would add to an already stretched Construction and Demolition Waste (C&DW) sector that currently contributes a significant portion of the overall waste generated in Australia. According to the Australian National Waste Report [3], in 2016â€“17C&DW represented 37% of core waste (municipal solid waste from households/ local government activities, commercial and industrial and C&DW sectors combined). As a result, it is inevitable that existing landfill sites will eventually be overwhelmed.
Recently, research has focused on various strategies to improve C&DW management. For example, in research focused on Australian C&DW management, Udawatta, et al. [4] identified barriers to waste management implementation, Tam, et al. [5] outlined the recycling habits of C&DW practitioners, and Davis, et al. [6] created a taxonomy of factors affecting waste management. Contamination results in waste being sent to landfill and this presents a significant cost impost and an unnecessary increase in landfill volume [5]. Manual intervention and sorting have been found to be inconsistent, inaccurate, unreliable and expensive, and widely regarded as a prohibitive cost to a construction company. These issues consequently reduce the propensity to recycle or divert waste from landfill.
Automation of C&DW recognition has the potential to alert C&DW managers to cases of bin contamination, or potentially to fully automatize C&DW sorting. There are precedents for this in industries other than construction. For example Sudha, et al. [7] devised a system that allowed the identification of biodegradable waste versus non-biodegradable waste. In recent construction industry-related research Xiao et al., [8,9] suggested that the recognition of various materials (concrete, rubber, black brick wood, plastic and brick) on a waste conveyor was practical. In Australia, most construction companies use bins as vessels to collect C&DW. Not all waste transfer/ management companies utilise waste conveyors, although they are becoming more ubiquitous. Focusing on the automated classification of C&DW in bins aligns this research with the reality of current C&DW management solutions undertaken in Australia. Recent advances in computer vision-based data analysis techniques, especially in deep convolutional neural network (CNN), provide a solution for such automated classification problems [10]. However, this research has not unearthed any instances of deep CNN applications used in real-world C&DW classification.
This research argues that using automated classification of C&DW on a construction site would enhance productivity, reduce construction costs generally, infrastructure costs more widely, and facilitate increased re-use or recycling/ diversion of construction waste from landfill, thereby providing environmental benefits. Consequently, the aim of the research was to design a model to classify digital images of various classes of C&DW deposited in a typical waste bin.
To achieve this, artificial neural networks were designed to classify C&DW images taken of material within waste bins. Due to the high accuracy required for real-world, real time classification, a deep CNN (VGG-16 model) has been chosen for this experiment [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]]. The data collected consisted of 1758 digital images of a bin as viewed from above. In 442 of these images, the bin contained one classification of waste (e.g. second fix timbers, shuttering/ formwork timbers, shuttering/ formwork ply and particleboards, hard plastics, soft plastic, bricks and concrete, cardboards and polystyrene). In 1023 digital images, the bin contained more than one classification, and in 183 images the bin was empty. Two different experiments were designed to classify single and mixed waste images respectively. In the first experiment 442 single class images were used with 83 empty bin images, totalling 525 images. The entire dataset of 1758 images were used in the second experiment.
In the first experiment, a deep CNN was trained to classify the single waste images in 8 classes according to the waste type in the bin. The results showed 94% accuracy in classifying the categories. In the second experiment, the deep CNN was trained to recognize the contents of the bin for both single and mixed waste classifications. This approach produced 92% accuracy of classification of the overall categories.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows; a traditional literature review is presented to frame the research and define the problem that construction waste presents, identify C&DW classes, describe the ability of deep CNN generally and more specifically its contemporary association with construction. A novel methodology is developed which determines appropriate methods. The latter explains how the data were derived, managed and interpreted. Results follow that lead to a narrative that incorporates the innovative artefact in a circular C&DW business model. This model identifies the experimental result's potential when aligned with a forecast of how C&DW processes may evolve. Implications for researchers and industry practitioners are offered, limitations are outlined. Finally, conclusions are drawn.
