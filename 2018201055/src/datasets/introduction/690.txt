Transmutation of spent nuclear fuel and transuranium elements poses a great challenge for present and future generations benefiting from nuclear energy. A general approach to transmutation of actinides in various nuclear systems was presented by [1] and the advantage of doing so in the fast neutron systems was discussed in [2]. Subcritical Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) represent an attractive option for both safe energy production [3] and spent fuel transmutation [4]. An ongoing ADS-related research at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna focuses primarily on the neutronics and actinide transmutation in the fast spallation neutron targets [5], [6], [7], [8]. Transmutation rates in the individual Th, U, Np, and Pu isotopes were studied in previous articles [9], [10]. Several decades ago, uranium fission and production of 239Pu were measured in massive natural and depleted uranium targets bombarded with 300- to 660-MeV protons [11].
This paper introduces actinide sandwiches as a method to simultaneously measure both the actinide production and their fission transmutation in the fast spectrum of the natural uranium spallation target Quinta. Experimental results show that Quinta has the potential to incinerate 237Np, 238Pu, and 239Pu isotopes at higher rates than their production. The results indicate that Quinta or a similar fast spallation neutron target might form a key building block of a potential future ADS.
