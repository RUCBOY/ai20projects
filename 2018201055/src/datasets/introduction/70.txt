Large variability in the delivered doses of orally inhaled products (OIPs) has remained a major challenge in inhalation device design and treatment planning. Replicating the efficacy and showing the bioequivalence of an OIP are difficult and continue to be the major issues in FDA regulation of generic OIPs. Performance variability in pulmonary delivery of OIPS can arise from different origins including the anatomical deviation, device usage, drug properties, and patient health (Courrier et al., 2002; Labiris and Dolovich 2003a, 2003b; Lu et al., 2017). Such sources of uncertainties are difficult to manage and can notably influence delivery efficiency and therapeutic outcomes. In contrast to extensive studies of factors associated with device, aerosol, and patient breathing, inter-subject variability in lung morphology in general, and diseased lung morphologies at different stages in particular, have rarely been reported. Considering the rising demand for quantifying the performance variability of OIPs, there is a pressing need for more efficient methods to generate physiologically realistic lung dichotomy geometries.
Understanding the intersubject variability in inhalation dosimetry of orally inhaled aerosols due to variations of aerosol properties, breathing conditions, device usage, and upper airway geometries has been the focus of many prior works (Borgstrom et al., 2006; De Backer et al., 2009; Garcia et al., 2009a, 2009b; Hofmann, Asgharian, & Winkler-Heil, 2002; Longest et al., 2013; Schroeter et al., 2010; Thekedar, Oeh, Szymczak, Hoeschen, & Paretzke, 2011; Vijverberg et al., 2011; Xi et al., 2013, Xi, Si, & Kim, 2015, 2016a; Xi & Yang, 2019). However, studies of dosimetry variability due to lung morphology variations are still scarce, due to both the technical challenges in model development, the time effort needed, ethical issues related to radiation risks, and the requirement of specialized imaging facility. Thoracic CT images with clinical resolutions allow the 3D rendering of lungs up to the fifth generation or so (Xi & Longest, 2008), while customized designed imaging facilities for research purposes can capture the human lung bifurcations of G11-12 (Corley et al., 2012). Recent progress in image segmentation has eased the 3D rendering of subject-specific lung morphology from CT and MRI scans. However, many processes, such as data repairing and geometry smoothing, remain largely manual and time-consuming (El Taoum et al., 2015; Xi et al., 2011, (Xi et al., 2016); Xi & Longest, 2007b). As a result, most studies have considered only a small number of image-based models (Choi et al., 2017; Garcia et al., 2009a, 2009b; Lambert et al., 2011; Miyawaki et al., 2017, 2019; Schroeter et al., 2010; Segal et al., 2003, 2008; Wu et al., 2014; Xi et al., 2012). A larger cohort of image-based models should be included to better understand intersubject variability in the human respiratory tract and its implications in inhalation toxicology and pulmonary drug delivery. Recent efforts in this direction include Choi et al. (Choi, Miyawaki, & Lin, 2018, 2019a, 2019b), who numerically studied pressure drop and particle deposition in CT-based lung models from 2 to 5 healthy and 2–8 asthmatic subjects. Cho et al. (Cho et al., 2019) compared CT images between 223 Koreans and 70 Whites and reported different interracial airway structures, especially in females. However, even with the advance in medical imaging techniques, it is still challenging to reconstruct an anatomically accurate lung geometry that is amenable for numerical analysis. The low resolution of CT and MRI data acquired for clinical purposes are often inadequate to reconstruct a clean lung geometry free from artifacts. It is even more challenging to study inter-subjective variability in inhalation dosimetry, which requires a large number of comparable lung models to ensure statistically significant results. Due to radiation risks, however, lung CT scans are often acquired in the suspected region only and do not include the entire conducting airway, which makes it unfeasible to compare different lung models.
An alternative method to quantify uncertainties in OIP performances due to patients’ lung morphology variability is statistical shape modeling (SSM). This method was initially developed by computer graphics and medical imaging researchers (Kent, 1997; Slice, 2007). It was later introduced into the biomechanics community in the 2000s to evaluate fracture risks or implant performance (Castro-Mateos et al., 2014; Fitzpatrick et al., 2007), face recognition (Maghari, Liao, & Belaton, 2012), forensics (Hauser et al., 2005), anthropology (Krishan et al., 2016), and evolutional biology (Macdonald-Wallis, 2014; Sella & Hirsh, 2005). It provides an effective approach to study larger numbers of subjects with a small number of original samples. For instance, Bryan et al. (Bryan et al., 2009) used a statistical shape model based on a training dataset comprising 21 patients to assess the risks of neck fracture in 1000 simulated patients. At the current stage, no statistical shape analysis has been reported in the human lungs.
The objective of this study is to demonstrate the usage of SSM in remodeling the lung morphology to quantify variability in inhalation dosimetry studies. The lung models extend to the 9th bifurcation generation (G9) and have 428 bronchiolar outlets. Specific aims include: (1) to generate a training database of 40 lung models by modifying an average G9 lung geometry to develop the statistical mean lung morphology and identify the principal components (or eigenmodes), (2) to regenerate new models by systematically varying the eigenmode and eigenvalues, (3) to simulate the airflow and particle deposition in the mean and modified lung geometries, and (4) to quantify the variability of inhalation dosimetry due to the airway remodeling.
