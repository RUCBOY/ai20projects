Security researchers consistently argue that organisations need information security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs to raise employees’ awareness of security risk, and to provide them with the required skills and knowledge to comply with security policy (Alshaikh 2020; Cram et al., 2019; Karjalainen et al., 2019). Despite the widespread implementation of such programs in many organisations, the rate of unintended breaches of security directives is still increasing. A recent report shows that 70% of security incidents are caused by employee noncompliance with organisational information security directives (NTT Security, 2019). This trend is consistent with previous security reports (e.g., Accenture and HfS Research, 2016; SANS, 2017) and academic literature (e.g., Almestahiri et al., 2017; Chatterjee et al., 2015; Crossler et al., 2013; Guo et al., 2011; Warkentin and Willison, 2009).
When developing SETA programs, organisations turn to “best practice” and industry standards. However, it remains unclear as to which SETA strategies are effective in specific contexts (Almestahiri et al., 2017; Beyer et al., 2015; Ki-Aries and Faily, 2017; Warkentin and Willison, 2009). As the literature points out, an underlying reason is that the standards and guidelines are neither grounded in theory nor on empirical evidence (Alshaikh et al., 2019; Jampen et al., 2020; Ng et al., 2009; Park and Chai, 2018; Siponen and Willison, 2009). Further, existing SETA programs aim to improve employee knowledge acquisition rather than behaviour and belief. Therefore, for organisations there is little clarity on how to increase the effectiveness of SETA programs to alter employee behaviour.
While there is considerable research on SETA conducted in the information systems security behaviour field (Guo et al., 2011; Puhakainen and Siponen, 2010; Sharma and Warkentin, 2019; Siponen and Vance, 2010; Willison and Warkentin, 2013; Willison et al., 2018), these studies approach the problem from an individual behaviour perspective instead of focusing at an organisational level. Within these studies, several theories (e.g., deterrence theory, neutralisation theory and protection motivation theory) have been applied to explain noncompliance with security policies (D'Arcy and Herath ,2011; Hanus and Wu, 2016; Siponen and Vance, 2010). However, the literature does not provide strategies and approaches to assist organisations in developing an effective SETA program to change employee behaviour (Alshaikh et al., 2019).
In this paper, we explore social marketing as an approach for developing more effective SETA programs. Our justification is that social marketing has been successfully used in the past to improve the effectiveness of behaviour change programs in other domains (Almestahiri et al., 2017; Tapp and Rundle-Thiele, 2016). Therefore, the aim of this paper is to use social marketing approaches to: (1) assess the effectiveness of the development process of existing SETA programs; and (2) propose a novel SETA development process. The study addresses the following research question:
How can organisations develop effective SETA programs to achieve behaviour change?
The paper is organized as follows. In our background section, we present best-practice industry guidelines on SETA; followed by introducing the social marketing approach to behaviour change. Subsequently, we explain the research methodology employed in this research. We then report the findings of the exploratory study where we map key social marketing principles to SETA practices in the six organisations under investigation. Next, we propose a new approach for the SETA development process based on social marketing. Finally, we conclude with implications of the research and direction for future work.
