A large variety of real-world testing, analysis and verification problems for computer and communication hardware and software can be reduced to equivalence checking of Mealy machines [13], [18], [19]. The same problem has emerged in the quantum realm with the rapid progress of quantum information technology in recent years; for example, equivalence checking of quantum circuits [36], [38] and quantum communication protocols [2], [3], property testing [34], fault detection and diagnosis [4], [6], [8], [27], reachability analysis [12] and test generation [29] of quantum circuits. But up to now, they are investigated separately in ad hoc manners without a unified model.
The overall aim of this paper is to introduce a quantum generalisation of Mealy machines with the hope that our results can provide a formal model and some useful theoretical tools for solving these problems. As determined by the basic postulates of quantum mechanics, the state space of a quantum Mealy machine is a (finite-dimensional) Hilbert space, its dynamics is modelled by unitary operators, and its outputs come as the outcomes of certain quantum measurements.
This paper studies two central problems, namely equivalence checking and minimisation, of quantum Mealy machines. As in classical Mealy machines, equivalence checking is carried out by inputting a sequence into the checked machines and then observing their respective outputs. A major difference between the classical and quantum cases is caused by the fact that quantum measurements can change the states of the observed systems. Consequently, a notion of scheduler must be introduced in the quantum case to specify the locations where quantum measurements are designed to perform.
Main Technical Contributions include:
•We develop two algorithms for equivalence checking of complexity O(mn6), where m is the number of input and output symbols and n the dimension of the state Hilbert spaces of the checked machines.•The minimisation problem is proved to be in PSPACE.
As an application, our algorithms are used for checking equivalence of quantum circuits in 30 benchmarks.
Quantum generalisations of various automata have been extensively studied in the literature; see for example [16], [26]. The problems of equivalence checking and minimisations for quantum automata rather that quantum Mealy machines defined in this paper have already been considered in a series of papers [17], [20], [22], [21], [23], [31], [35], [37]. The techniques developed in this paper can be used to improve some of their complexity results.
Organisation of the Paper: The notion of quantum Mealy machine is defined and its behaviour is described in Sec. 2. Our main results including two algorithms are given in Sec. 3. The improvements over the complexity results for other quantum automata with our new techniques are also briefly discussed there. The case studies for equivalence checking of benchmark quantum circuits are described in Sec. 4. The proofs of our main theorems are presented in Sec. 5. For readability, the proofs of other results are deferred into the Appendices. A short conclusion is drawn in Sec. 6.
