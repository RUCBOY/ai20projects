In recent years, many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to help clinicians as supplementary tools [[1], [2], [3]]. A significant amount of work burden of clinical experts and the occurrence of misdiagnosis can be reduced by developing CAD systems. Among the imaging protocols, panoramic X-ray imaging is a popular diagnostic method owing to its very small dose of radiation when compared to the cone beam computed tomography [4]. This method captures the entire oral structure in a two-dimensional (2D) image and provides a noninvasive treatment plan, such as implants and tooth extraction. Moreover, forensic identification can be conducted by analyzing the corresponding individual teeth of the subjects [5]. Various applications such as classification [6,[38], [39], [40], [41]] and segmentation [7,8] were developed using dental panoramic X-ray images [3]. Especially, automated detection and identification of individual teeth are the most demanded algorithms and a critical prerequisite for other applications [9].
To localize objects of interest from images, various object detection methods were extensively developed until recently. Initially, classical machine learning-based algorithms were proposed. These classical methods typically employed feature descriptors and trained classifiers to obtain object boxes [10,11]. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been showing groundbreaking results over the classical methods by exploiting convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. Modern CNN-based detection methods can be categorized into two primary methods: 1) anchor-based [16,20] and 2) point-based approaches [21,[13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23]]. The anchor-based methods employ exhaustive classifications on predefined anchor boxes and typically perform a non-maximum suppression technique to localize each object [16]. Conversely, the point-based object detection attempts to regress points to delineate objects such as the center point [23]. Besides the center point, several key points (e.g., left-top and right-bottom corners) are simultaneously regressed for accurate object detection [22,24]. The latest studies show that the point-based approaches are demonstrating more promising results than the anchor-based methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency [23].
Although CNN-based detection methods are showing groundbreaking results, high accuracy must be guaranteed so that the algorithm can be used as an important auxiliary diagnostic measure in clinical practices. It was reported in [9] that an automated deep learning-based algorithm has an impact on teeth detection and identification in dental panoramic images; however, the study showed possible errors in detection, which can result in subsequent identification errors. Thus, the simple adoption of a general CNN-based detection algorithm cannot provide the high standard of accuracy that is required in the clinics. It is critical to build a robust metric that can guarantee accuracy of the algorithm to verify the applicability of the system.
In this paper, we propose a CNN-based individual tooth detection and identification algorithm based on direct regression of object points. First, we propose a points regression neural network by employing spatial distance regularization (DR) loss. The proposed network performs center point regression of 32 fixed anatomical teeth, which automatically assigns anatomical identifiers. A novel inter-point DR penalty is employed on the output prediction of 32 points on a neighborhood basis. Subsequently, bounding boxes of an individual tooth is localized in a multitask fashion. For the final box regressions, a multitask framework is applied for an additional offset vector regression, which is trained to delineate a marginal error vector of a center point. The superiority of the proposed method not only depends on accurate localization but also on automated individual identification of teeth. An additional identification algorithm is not required in the proposed method. The proposed method automatically identifies each tooth by localizing all 32 possible regions of the teeth including missing ones. The experimental results showed that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods; moreover, various conditions of test images illustrated the clinical validity of the algorithm. The primary contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:
•Integration of a point-based detection method and fixed 32-point regression in a multitask framework.•The proposed method does not require any additional classification methods.•Introduction of a DR loss between neighboring teeth to improve the regression.•Multitask training of box parameters and the marginal offset vector of the center point.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we review related works on object detection and identification methods. Further, we describe our proposed method in Section 3. Section 4 demonstrates the experimental results and Sections 5 and 6 present the discussion and conclusion, respectively.
