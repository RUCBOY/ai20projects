In the recent years, one of the main challenging targets of robotics and computer-integrated manufacturing is the implementation of energy-efficient solutions, especially within the framework of Industry 4.0. This trend is pursued not only by economical considerations, but also by actions aimed at limiting climate change [1]. Since the industrial sector is responsible for a large percentage of the total global energy consumption (37% in 2017 [2]), sustainable manufacturing has inevitably become an integral part of European Union’s development plans [3]. Moreover, industries have recently taken advantages of the integration of 3D printing process into production lines [4], [5]. This technology allows for new manufacturing paradigms, exploited in particular in small medium enterprises, such as production flexibility and on-demand goods customization at relative low prices [6], [7]. In this context, several approaches have been studied to enhance the energetic performance of robotic and mechatronic systems [8].
Possible solutions for energy efficiency optimization include the design of robots with lightweight arms and components [9], [10], the recovering of energy that would be otherwise dissipated (e.g. by substituting traditional drives with regenerative ones [11], [12]), and the optimal positioning of manipulators with respect to the required task [13], [14]. Other approaches to reduce torque and power consumption rely on the optimal planning of paths and trajectories that the manipulators have to follow, such as in [15], [16], [17], [18], as well on the optimization of cycle time and coordination of multi-robot systems [19].
A particular method to increase the energetic performance of robotic systems is based on the exploitation of the system natural dynamics, using an approach called natural motion [20]. The natural motion is defined as the system response caused by the conversion of potential elastic energy, stored in compliant elements, into kinetic energy. The addition of compliant elements such as springs to a robotic system was first adopted in gravity balancing techniques [21], [22], [23]. Additional approaches to reduce the energy consumption with the introduction of external devices rely on balancing masses or counterweights [24], pneumatic actuators [25], and reaction wheels [26]. However, gravity balancing techniques based on the introduction of springs do not take into account dynamic effects that cannot be neglected when dealing with high speed motions. Compliant elements, if properly optimized, can be beneficial for energy or actuator effort reduction especially when cyclic tasks, such as legged robot locomotion or repetitive pick-and-place operations, are considered.
In this context, several examples can be found in the recent literature. In [27], Boscariol et al. optimize the spring parameters and attaching points for the torque reduction in a one degree-of-freedom mechanism (47% and 32% of peak torque reduction, with numerical and experimental tests, respectively), whereas Barreto et al. implement the idea of natural motion for energy efficiency in a five-bar linkage (up to 68% of energy reduction with numerical simulations) [28]. Other examples can be found in [29], where a Delta robot is employed for pick-and-place tasks (no energy required by the actuators for a simulated one-way point-to-point motion of the robot), and in [11], where the energetic performance of a Delta-2 robot with regenerative drives and torsional springs mounted in parallel to the main motors are evaluated (up to 70% of energy reduction in simulation). Furthermore, Van der Spaa et al. analyze in [30] the unparameterized optimization of spring parameters in parallel elastic actuators (no energy is needed to perform a simulated pick-and-place operation using an optimal nonlinear spring).
Nowadays, when dealing with robotics and manufacturing, one of the most popular and growing processes is robot assisted additive manufacturing [31]. Additive manufacturing describes a technology emerged in the late 1980s comprehending a group of processes that produce objects by depositing materials in a layer-by-layer way [32]. This technology is usually combined with multi-axis robotic systems to achieve flexibility and high-quality results [33].
Recent examples of robotic systems for additive manufacturing and 3D printing can be found in [34], where a robotic arm is employed for hydrogel in-situ printing, in [35], where a robotic 3D printing system is used for ceramic manufacturing, and in [36], where large-scale 3D printing is performed with a cable-suspended parallel robot. The adoption of parallel robots is widely used in several fields of manufacturing thanks, in many cases, to their possibility of achieving high speed and acceleration in the movement of the end-effector. One common parallel architecture for additive manufacturing is given by the Linear Delta Robot (LDR), which is a 3-DOF 3-PSS (3 prismatic-spherical-spherical kinematic chain) parallel manipulator that allows three translations of the end-effector in the operational space. The linear delta architecture makes this robot appropriate for 3D printing tasks, where cyclic operations are needed to deposit the material layer by layer. Indeed, it allows quick access to large build vertical volumes and the possibility of planning tool-paths containing dynamic z-values within each layer [37], [38]. The LDR is employed for 3D printing in [39], where a novel design of Linear Delta parallel robot with single legs and rotational joints is proposed for additive manufacturing, and in [38], where a LDR is adopted to improve surface finishing and flexibility, as well as to decrease time costs in curved layer fused filament fabrication. Furthermore, in [40] a Linear Delta mechanism is used for digital light processing 3D printing, whereas in [41] the LDR architecture is employed for metal injection molding.
In the field of robotic additive manufacturing, energy efficiency is usually investigated by optimizing material saving, waste recycling, temperature distribution, and layers parameters. In [42] material and energy loss in commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers are analyzed: the authors show that reducing preheating and standby time can reduce the energy consumption of FDM. In [43] a design of experiment approach is used to optimize parameters for 3D printed parts, such as slice orientation, number of shells (border outlines printed first for each layer), infill percentage and layer height. 3D printing parameters are also optimized in [44], where an adaptive multi-layer customization approach is proposed to increase the sustainability of the process. Moreover, in [45] the authors analyze the FDM process in order to enable lightweight and time-efficient construction with minimized energy consumption. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no examples of methods based on the introduction of elastic elements to achieve energy efficiency in 3D printing robotic tasks can be found in the present literature. For this reason, we would like to fill this gap and to propose an application of this technique to a 3D printing process, which represents a cyclical operation, especially for what concerns the layers filling.
In this paper we present a novel approach for sustainable 3D printing with a Linear Delta Robot equipped with elastic elements. Energy saving is achieved thanks to the optimal design of linear springs that are mounted on the parallel robot with two different configurations. In the first solution, three springs are connected in parallel to the prismatic joints of the robot, whereas the second solution considers one spring connected between the mobile platform and the fixed frame of the robot. To optimize the spring parameters, i.e. stiffness and no-load length, the inverse kinematic and dynamic models of the manipulator are implemented. An electro-mechanical model of the transmission chain and of the electric motors is as well adopted to compute the overall energy consumption. The proposed method is experimentally validated with a 3D printing trajectory.
The main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: (a) the introduction of a natural motion approach for the optimal design of elastic elements mounted on a Linear Delta Robot for energy efficiency, (b) the comparison of different configurations for the elastic elements mounted on the parallel manipulator, (c) the evaluation of the method on a 3D printing task, and (d) the experimental validation of the proposed approach.
The paper is organized as follows: Sections 2 and 3 report the kinematic and dynamic models of the parallel manipulator, respectively, whereas Section 4 describes the natural motion approach applied to a 3D printing process. Section 5 reports the results of the numerical simulations, whereas in Section 6 the experimental set-up and the architecture of the control system are illustrated. The experimental validation of the method and the results obtained with the proposed approach are presented in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 draws the conclusions of this work.
