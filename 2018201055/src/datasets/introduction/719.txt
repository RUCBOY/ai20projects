With the increasing complexity of real-word problems, uncertain group decision making (UGDM) is a kind of commonly considered multistage process to deal with diverse information. The root of UGDM related to fuzzy information can date back to the work of Zadeh [55], and the research in the context of rough sets can go back to the work of Rauszer [35], [36], [37]. Over time, UGDM has been developed both in theory [13], [55] and applications [20], [32], [40]. The reason may be that it is an intersection of objectives and constraints given in the complex environment where human intelligence has the ability to manipulate fuzzy concepts and fuzzy answer instructions [3]. On the one hand, some extensions of fuzzy sets have been proposed to suit for quantitative, such as nonstationary fuzzy sets [12], intuitionistic fuzzy sets [2] and hesitant fuzzy sets [38], etc. On the other hand, some extended fuzzy linguistic approaches including virtual linguistic term model [52], hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set (HFLTS) [39], probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) [31] and nested probabilistic linguistic term sets (NPLTSs) [46], have been proposed to describe information, and they are closer to human cognitive processes. At present, the fuzzy linguistic approaches have been considered to the best choice [56] in UGDM and they have achieved great development in many fields [24], [28], [47]. Therefore, it is interesting and worth making a comprehensive analysis of UGDM, and scholars can do more valuable research for further investigation.
Bibliometrics is not only a relatively mature and important branch of intelligence science [5], [44], but also a discipline that is based on quantitative analysis by the extensive intersection and combination of philology, information science, mathematics and statistics in a specific area [17]. Since bibliometrics can reveal internal structure and the development trend of a particular research direction or a specified journal, it has been broadly used to many areas. For instance, in terms of a specified journal, the inner structure and the evolution of the European Journal of Operational Research [23], IEEE Transaction on Fuzzy Systems [53] and Information Sciences [54] journals were presented based on bibliometric methods. With respect to a research direction, the leading trends of sustainable energy [16], economy [10] and engineering [27] were explored by using bibliometric indicators.
Bibliometric analysis is an effective tool to evaluate the merits of a given discipline or category [41], and mapping science can analyze the structure of the research field greatly [8], [49]. In order to provide a comprehensive and deep overview of UGDM clearly, CiteSpace [6] and VoS viewer [42] are selected as two visualization tools to investigate the current status and development trends. Because they specialize in presenting the co-citation network, co-authorship and revealing the structure of a picture research field [6]. In particular, hot topics and the development trends of a research field can be revealed by the burst detection analysis and timeline analysis in CiteSpace. Owe to unique advantages of CiteSpace and VoS viewer in bibliometric analysis, they have been widely applied in many fields, such as computer program [43], computer and information ethics [18] and information literacy assessment [33]. For example, Morar and Agachi [29] focused on the evolution of heat integration and hear exchanger network synthesis. Niazi and Hussain [30] studied computing based on agent and analyzed the complex network combined with the bibliographic data on the basis of visualization.
Until now, several overviews related to UGDM have been explored, which fall into two major categories. One emphasizes on the review of the applications, such as supplier evaluation and selection [21], environment management [34], sustainability issues [57] and power system [1]. Another focuses on the techniques, such as bibliometric-based review [4], modeling uncertainty [9] and heuristic decision making [14]. However, there is still room for further research. For example, Fabio [4] provided a bibliometric-based review about fuzzy decision making from four parts, which are influential journals, papers, authors and universities. The work gave the basic analysis from the whole period of time, but it is difficult to find development trend and hot topics during different sub-periods in fuzzy decision making. Therefore, it is necessary to make a deep analysis from multiple aspects during the last four decades, so that scholars can better understand the development of UGDM, and further obtain some new ideas and opinions.
In this study, our work belongs to review publications related to UGDM on the basis of bibliometric indictors from 1980 to 2019. The contributions of this paper lie in the following aspects:
(1)General analysis is provided to describe current status of UGDM at the levels of countries/regions, institutions and authors, which considers fundamental and classical indictors, such as H-index [19], numbers, citations and collaborations, etc.(2)Cooperation networks and dynamic analysis are presented to show the development of UGDM from the view angle of countries/regions, institutions and authors.(3)From the point of view of countries/regions, institutions and authors, deep analysis is given to help scholars better grasp hot topics of UGDM, including burst detection, timeline view and bibliographic coupling analysis,(4)According to the above-mentioned analysis, the current challenges and possible directions of UGDM are discussed from the aspects of both theoretical analysis and practical applications.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 illustrates the scope and data source. Section 3 gives general analysis. In Section 4, cooperation networks are presented. Section 5 gives deep researches including burst detection analysis, co-occurrence analysis, timeline view analysis and bibliographic coupling analysis. Section 6 provides further discussions containing current challenges and possible directions. Section 7 ends the paper with some conclusions.
