Metal foams (MFs) are classified as hybrids, among composites, sandwich and lattice materials [1]. Special MFs are called metal matrix syntactic foams (MMSFs), where the cells are formed by a second phase of roughly uniform size distributed evenly within the material [2]. The MMSFs’ matrix material is typically a lightweight metal, mainly Al [3], [4], [5], [6], [7] or Mg [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] but Zn [13], [14], [15], [16], Fe [17], [18], [19], [20] and Ti [21], [22], [23], [24] are also popular. The foam structure of the MMSFs is created by the introduction of porous or hollow particles as a second phase (or filler material) into the matrix material [25], [26], [27], [28]. These foams are also called composite metal foams (CMFs) since there is a bond between the particles and the matrix material through an interface layer – resulting in a classic composite structure. CMFs have been tested for withstanding ballistic threats, providing fire resistance and thermal insulation, and containing hazardous materials, with promising results, superior to homogenous matrix material structures [29], [30], [31], [32]. Compared to other MFs, syntactic foams are preferable for their increased (specific) strength, higher energy absorption and better designability [33].
Bimodality is defined by having two distinct characteristics for one property and nearly the same for all other features of the materials or particles. According to the literature, bimodality in CMFs appears trough variation of the second phase: either the spheres are of the same size, but made from different materials [34], [35] or of the same material, but with different sizes. In bimodal composite metal foams (BCMFs), the matrix material is filled with porous spheres of two different and quite distinct average diameters. Although the cells are formed by a second phase, and the distribution of the spheres may be considered consistent, the foam itself will not be homogenous; therefore, the syntactic definition is not entirely applicable. The ratio of spheres of different diameters may be different from 50 to 50 vol%; their size distribution is shown in Fig. 1.Download : Download high-res image (560KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Májlinger et al. [36] examined AlSi12 MMSFs filled with Ø1.4 mm sized mixed-oxide (Al2O3 and SiO2 based) ceramic hollow sphere (CHS) and pure Fe hollow sphere (Fe HS) particles. The volume ratio of the overall filler volume fraction or filling rate (~64 vol%) was varied from 100–0% to 0–100% CHS-Fe HS in 20% steps. A favourable interface layer was formed between the fillers and the matrix. Compression tests revealed that higher CHS content resulted in higher compressive strength, but the specimens also became more brittle. This allows tailoring the properties with different volume ratios for specific applications. A local maximum of energy absorption was achieved with a 60–40% CHS-Fe HS volume ratio.
Movahedi et al. [37] investigated functionally graded (FG) MMSFs with activated carbon (AC) and expanded perlite (EP) fillers. The AC and EP particles were distributed in four different ways: longitudinally (two- and six-layered), radially and at random in ZA27 zinc-aluminium alloy matrix. The EP particle size fell between 2.0 and 2.8 mm, and the average size of the AC particles was 2.4 mm. The longitudinal grading provided the highest plateau stress and energy absorption. Radial and random FG-MMSFs bore higher compressive strength values. In all tested foams, the EP parts had a ductile layer-by-layer collapse, while the AC parts exhibited brittle, sheared fracture.
BCMFs with mixed filler materials were produced by Su et al. [38]. In their research, expanded glass (EG) and alumina hollow spheres (HS) were used in two size ranges in ZL111 (AlSi8Cu3) aluminium alloy matrix. Three different volume ratios (75–25%, 50–50%, 25–75% HS-EG) were examined in the 3–4 mm particle size range. Parallel, foams filled with pure HS and pure EG were also tested for comparison. In the 2–3 mm particle size range only pure HS and pure EG were evaluated. No significant chemical reactions were detected between the matrix material and the fillers. The compressive tests revealed that with the increase of EG content, the mechanical properties decreased. The same decrease happens with the size increment of the used particles regardless of their material. From the mechanical properties of the pure alumina HS and EG foams, the properties of the hybrid MMSFs could be predicted using the ‘rule of mixture’.
Tao et al. [39] investigated ceramic microsphere (CM) filled BCMFs with different nominal filler particle diameters. Fine (75–125 µm) and coarse (250–500 µm) porous mixed oxide particles (hollow spheres) were used. Three different volume ratios (30–70%, 50–50%, 70–30% fine-coarse) were examined, as well as pure fine and pure coarse MMSFs for comparison. A 25% porosity increment could be achieved with the production of BCMFs compared to the unimodal MMSFs. The produced foams proved high plateau stress and good ductility.
AlSi12 matrix CHS filled BCMFs were examined by Orbulov et al. [40]. Loosely packed sets of 2 different nominal diameter CHSs (150 µm and 1500 µm) were used with 33–67% volume ratios in samples with three different aspect ratios (H/D = 1.0, 1.5, 2.0). For comparison, unimodal specimens with pure small and pure large CHSs were also made. The compression curves showed a second local peak over H/D = 1.0, and the ‘rule of mixture’ was proven to be applicable to estimate the compressive strength of the BCMFs from the evaluation data of the unimodal CMFs.
The peculiarity of BCMFs lies in the volume ratio and the size difference of the two types of hollow spheres [41]. The filling rate (Ƞ) of syntactic and bimodal foams is the volume of the second phase divided by the total volume of the foam sample. Bimodal packing, with spheres of two different average diameters, has a higher filling rate than unimodal random close-packing (RCP) of spheres (f1): Ƞ > f1 = 0.64 [42]. With calculations of bimodal packing, this filling rate is determined with respect to the volume ratio of the larger and smaller spheres (VL/VS) and the diameter rate of the two types of spheres (u = dL/dS) [43]. When the density of the two types of CHSs is even, there is an ascendant correlation between the diameter ratio and the filling rate.
During this research, the optimal mixing volume ratio was determined empirically. The produced samples were evaluated mechanically and microstructurally to determine the quality of the castings. The optimum of the mixed volume ratios was assessed by mathematical analysis, and the correlation was confirmed with macrostructural examination and upsetting tests.
