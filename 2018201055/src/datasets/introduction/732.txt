Cadmium ion (Cd2+), a highly toxic heavy metal ion, is characterized by bioaccumulation and non-biodegradablity with a long biological half-life (10∼30 years) [1]. Cd2+ is not an essential micronutrient for the human body, and its natural distribution is not widespread in minerals and rocks [2]. However, with the exploitation of resources, Cd2+ has been widely utilized in various industries, such as pigments, leather, electroplating, and rechargeable battery production [3]. Trace amounts of Cd2+ discharged into the environment have been causing serious pollution and deposition in flora and fauna [4], which in turn accumulates in human body through the food chain. As a result, Cd2+ pollution dramatically increases the incidence of kidney failure and diseases of immune system [5,6]. Due to the severe health threats, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified cadmium as a category I carcinogen in 1997 [7,8]. Many committees and organizations in the world have also strictly set the maximum Cd2+ level in water and food [[9], [10], [11], [12]]. The potential hazards from toxic Cd2+ presents an important need for the rapid and selective detection of Cd2+, especially in liquid medium in daily life.
Traditional methods for Cd2+ detection include flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) [13], atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) [14], inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) [15], inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) [16], graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) [17], and so on. For these methods, the obvious limitations include complicated sample pretreatment, expensive instrumentation and long test duration. As a result, these methods cannot meet the requirements for rapid, low-cost and field detection of Cd2+. Due to high sensitivity and specificity, numerous studies on biosensors for Cd2+ detection have been reported recently [[18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]]. Among them, optical and electrochemical approaches for signal conversion are mostly reported. Optofluidics [18], fluorescence [19], quantum dots [20] and colorimetry [36] are frequently adopted as optical methods, while current density [22], potentiometry [32] and voltammetry [34] are commonly found as electrochemical methods.
For a biosensor with good selectivity, the probe to effectively recognize the target is always of crucial importance. Porphyrin [24], imprinted polymer [25], peptide [26] and aptamer [27,28] are popularly used probes for Cd2+ coordination or reaction. Because DNA aptamer has advantages in artificial designing, high affinity and selectivity for molecule recognition [[29], [30], [31]], aptamer based sensors for Cd2+ detection is becoming attractive. Quite a number of aptasensors for Cd2+ have been reported [[32], [33], [34], [35], [36]].
As for aptasensor, an electrochemical sensor for detecting Cd2+ in aqueous solution is reported based on aptamer modified screen-printed electrode (SPE), with a linear range from 0.89 nM to 8.9 μM [34]. The limit of detection (LOD) of this sensor is 0.45 nM, and the detection time containing sample incubation is longer than 30 min. Another reported electrochemical aptasensor using polycrystalline gold disk electrodes achieves a LOD of 92 nM in 1 min’s duration, and has a linear range of (250 nM–5 μM) [28]. Aptamer is also applied in optical approaches for Cd2+ detection. A fluorescence aptasensor based on split DNAzyme fragments is designed to realize amplified detection of Cd2+ with a LOD of 10 pM and a linear range of (10 pM–1 μM), while the reaction lasts 120 min [35]. Another typical colorimetric aptasensor for Cd2+ based on gold nanoparticles is developed to yield a LOD of 0.01 μM, with a linear range of (17.8 nM–0.18 μM). The reaction time is 10 min [36]. Some of these molar concentrations have been converted from mass concentrations in the references.
In this work, we develop an easy-to-operate and sensitive aptasensor based on a gold interdigitated electrode (IDE). Microfluidic enrichment of ultratrace Cd2+ is realized by AC electrothermal (ACET) effect. During this enrichment process, the sensitive interfacial capacitance change is measured to perform the detection in a duration of 30 s. The LOD of 253.16 aM is ultralow, and the linear range of (fM ∼ pM) is adequate for most applications. Besides, the good selectivity of Cd2+ and capacity for different liquid media are also demonstrated.
To clearly illustrate the performance of recent aptasensors for Cd2+ detection, a concise list of sensor parameters is presented in Table 1, where the device (or material), sensing mechanism, LOD, linear range and turnaround time (containing pretreatment steps) are compared. According to Table 1, this sensor has a superior performance, being suitable for real-time and ultra-trace Cd2+ detection.Table 1.
