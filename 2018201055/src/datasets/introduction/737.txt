As natural metabolites extracted directly from plants or animals, natural dyes have attracted extensive attention due to their environmental friendliness and biodegradability. Virous reports about natural dyes have been published, and products from natural dyes are also common in the market. As one of the most famous natural dyes, madder has been widely used in the dyeing of cotton fabrics. Moreover, the roots and stems of madder can be used to promote blood circulation. The composition of natural madder dyestuffs, extracted from madder roots, has been proved to be complicated, which contains alizarin (Fig. 1), quinalizarin, purpuro-xanthin, purpurin, pseudopurpurin, munjistin, ruberythricacid and other hydroxyl anthraquinone derivatives [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. The dyeing properties of madder mainly comes from alizarin, the main pigment of madder.Download : Download high-res image (154KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

Although alizarin has so many advantages, limitations including the poor color fastness, especially poor light fastness have limited its wide application. The average light fastness of natural dyes on cotton fabrics is less than three grades, which shows obvious discoloration after lighting [[6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]].
The photochemical reactions of dye molecules could be attributed to isomerism reactions, oxidation or reduction reactions. Moreover, some examples about photo-polymerization, photo-substitution have also been reported [[12], [13], [14]]. Chipalkatti et al. believed that azo dyes are likely to undergo photo-reduction reactions on protein fibers, while photo-oxidation reactions mainly occur on non-protein fibers [15]. Victorin et al. demonstrated that p-naphthol azobenzene dyes mainly undergo photo-reduction reaction on polypropylene fibers [16]. Neevel et al. reported that singlet oxygen played key roles in photo-oxidation progress [17]. Freeman et al. believed that the main photo-oxidation reaction of anthraquinone disperse dyes occurred on polyester fibers and nylon [18]. Moreover, many dyes have been found to be photosensitizers themselves, which can absorb energy of light and be transferred into sensitive state, which could be further related to the formation of free radicals [19]. Thus, the mechanism of photochemical reactions of dyes varies from the species of dyes and fibers, and is difficult to be generalized.
Compared with other dyes, the composition of natural dyes is complex, which may contain some other oxidizing or reducing substances in addition to the main pigments [20]. However, the reports about the photo-fading progress of natural dyes are still rare. In this paper, we studied the mechanism of photo-fading and discoloration progress of madder dyed cotton fabric. Some methods including UV, HPLC, and HPLC-MS were used to explore the structure changes of alizarin before and after illumination. Reaction mechanism and the effects of oxygen, pH value and mordant metal ions on the photostability of alizarin were also investigated. Moreover, computer color matching system (Datacolor) was used to measure the photostability of cotton fabrics, and the effects of pre-mordant and moisture on the color change of cotton fabric were also discussed. Our work is of great significance, which could not only help to find a method to improve their light fastness, but also open the way to further studies aiming at improving the photostability of natural dyes or developing new photo-stable dyes.
