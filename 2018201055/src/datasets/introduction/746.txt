Owing to heightened oil demand, various enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques including thermal, chemical, and miscible methodologies have reached a mature stage to appropriately displace the remaining oil in the hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs. In the history of EOR technology advancement, the injection of various gases such as hydrocarbon gases, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide into the reservoir oil has been grabbed the attention of petroleum science scholars. Commercially established in the 1970s, carbon dioxide (CO2) flooding treatment is a momentous EOR approach which has been a subject of sustained research pursuit in the last decades [1], [2]. According to pivotal operational experiences and studies [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], the injection of CO2 gas into oil reservoirs offers superior efficiency with respect to other gases from the economic and environmental perspectives [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. CO2 is a colorless, odorless, highly dense (60% greater than dry air), and low-cost gas, in which the miscibility to hydrocarbons takes place in lower pressures in comparison to other gases [14]. The commercial prosperousness of CO2 injection has been asserted in the context of numerous studies in divert reservoirs over the world [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Furthermore, a CO2 injection project alleviates the atmospheric emissions of the CO2 by storing this significant greenhouse gas in the sedimentary deposits [7].
The oil displacement during CO2 injection can be implemented in immiscible and miscible manners. The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP), above which the interface between the injected gas and the reservoir fluid withdraws, is the key benchmark differentiating the two abovementioned manners. As per the earlier work of Holm and Josendal [21], MMP is the pressure at/above which greater than 80% of the reservoir oil is recovered at the injected gas breakthrough. Moreover, according to an operational scale rule-of-thumb [22], MMP associates with an oil recovery of at least 90% at 1.2 PV (pore volume) of CO2 injected.
The immiscible displacement mode takes place in pressures below the MMP, in which no unique phase could be established and fewer reciprocation of CO2 and oil components takes place [23]. However, the injected gas dissolves in the reservoir fluid giving rise to the mobilization of a portion of remained oil in the formation [16]. Accordingly, the major premises behind the immiscible flooding are the reduction in the viscosity and interfacial tension, swelling of the oil, and solution gas drive mechanism [19], [20]. The miscible treatment can be achieved in pressures above the MMP based on various mass transfer mechanisms including first contact and dynamic (multiple contacts) miscibility. There are several solvents including ethane, propane, and butane which constitute a unique phase at the first contact with the reservoir fluid. However, the miscibility of the CO2 into the reservoir oil occurs by dynamic miscibility (multiple contacts) mechanisms. The dynamic miscibility can be accomplished by the vaporizing and condensing gas drive processes, in which the reservoir hydrocarbons with intermediate molecular weight (MW) vaporizes into the injected CO2 and a portion of injected CO2 condenses into the reservoir oil conversely [7], [20], [24]. The interfacial tension (IFT) and consequently the capillary number (Nc) tend toward zero and infinity, respectively, and yields to an entirely miscible phase between the CO2 injected and the reservoir oil. As a result, the miscible CO2 injection brings a wealth of efficiency by a remarkable reduction in the remaining oil saturation in the porous media. The immiscible CO2 flooding, however, does not suffice to produce the remaining reservoir fluid, and an ample residual oil saturation may be left in the porous medium [25]. Accordingly, the miscible manner constitutes the dominant portion of the CO2 injection projects around the world [26].
Although miscible CO2 flooding has established itself as the superior scenario for EOR projects, its applicability is not ensured for all hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs. For instance, the vaporable components (C5-C30) of the heavy oils are insufficient for leading to a miscible condition. Additionally, the solubility pressure required in the case of a light oil may exceed the formation fracturing pressure [27]. Accordingly, a combination of implications including oil composition, oil swelling factor, and CO2-oil solubility should be met to appropriately design a CO2-EOR scenario. Defines as the ratio of the CO2 volume (in the solution) to the oil volume (at the solubility temperature), the CO2-oil solubility parameter plays a vital role in designing a miscible flooding process. There are extensive investigations that have shed light on the factors affecting the foregoing parameter. An expeditious review on the aforesaid studies demonstrates a significant association between the CO2-oil solubility and the molecular weight of the oil (MWo), oil specific gravity (γ), saturation pressure (Ps), and temperature (T) [1], [28], [29], [30], [31]. The heavier oils (with high molecular weight/low API) correspond to a smaller extent of CO2-oil solubility [28]. Furthermore, the solubility of CO2 in the reservoir oil increases by pressure increment as well as the temperature reduction [32], [33]. However, it should be mentioned that the gaseous CO2 outperforms the liquefied CO2 from the standpoint of solubility into the oil. Hence, the dependency of the CO2-oil solubility to the pressure dwindles for temperatures beneath the CO2 critical temperature (T < Tc, CO2) and the pressures above the CO2 liquefaction pressure (P > Pliquefaction, CO2) [34], [35].
Having greater insight into the CO2-oil solubility would yield useful information regarding the prosperousness of CO2 injection scenario. There are several methods regarding CO2-oil solubility measurement, the most reliable being the laboratory studies. However, the experimental measurements are time-consuming, not to mention their noticeable expenses. Accordingly, a plentiful of studies were undertaken to probe models to accurately predict the aforementioned physical property of CO2-oil mixtures.
Several graphical and mathematical correlations have been proposed to link CO2-oil solubility to easier-to-measure parameters [28]. Welker and Dunlop [29] utilized datasets of thirteen dead oils to make a connection between the CO2-oil solubility, the carbonate pressure, and the oil API gravity. This model was limited to temperature value of 80 °F, the pressures up to 800 psia, and API gravity between 20 and 40. Furthermore, they proposed a correlation to linearly correlate the solubility to the swelling factor as follows:(1)Rs=1000(SF-1)0.35where Rs and SF stand for the solubility and swelling factor of the CO2-oil mixture, respectively.
An improvement over the above-mentioned model was developed by Simon and Graue [36], in which the data attributed to the mixtures of CO2 and nine dead oils were employed in a more extended temperature and pressure ranges. They correlated the CO2-oil solubility with the CO2 fugacity (up to 1800 psia), UPO characterization factor also called Watson [37] K factor (11–12.4), saturation pressure (up to 2800 psia), and temperature (100–250 °F) in the context of three graphical representations. Mulliken and Sandler [38] integrated Peng-Robinson EOS [39] and a characteristic of the oil to predict the Rs and SF as a function of oil specific gravity and UPO characterization factor (or mean average boiling point). Mehrotra and Svreck [40], suggested the following correlation for estimation of the CO2-dead oil solubility (Rs, m3/m3) in accordance to input variables of saturation pressure (Ps, MPa) and temperature (T, °C):(2)Rs=-a-bPs+cPsT+273.15+dPsT+273.152where the constant parameters a, b, c, and d correspond to the 0.0073508, 14.794, 6425.8, and 4971.39 values, respectively. It is noteworthy that aforesaid correlation is restricted to pressures of less than 6.38 MPa and temperatures between 23.89 and 97.22 °C. Chung et al. [31] extended another relationship between CO2 solubility in dead oil and three input variables, namely pressure (Ps, psia), temperature (T, °F), and oil specific gravity:(3)Rs=1/aγbTc+dTeexp-fPs+g/Pswhere the parameters a through g take the values of 0.4934E−2, 4.0928, 0.571E−6, 1.6428, 0.6763E−3, 781.334, and −0.2499, respectively. For this purpose, experimental measurements were carried out on heavy crudes of five hydrocarbon fields encompass Bartlett (Kansas), Merey (Australia), Trix-Liz (Texas), McKittrick (California), and Chaffee (California), in which the API gravity ranges from 10 to 20. They contemplated the pressure (up to 4000 psia) and temperature (in a range from 75 to 200 °F) as the dominant parameters influencing the solubility.
Although the aforementioned graphical/mathematical correlations provide useful approximations in the absence of the experimental data, they fall ill with various aspects including remarkable deviation from the experimental data. The empirical correlations with all their concomitant advantages have been generated per a confined dataset that embodies the restricted rock and fluid properties and experimental conditions. This captures the essence of advising recent methodologies to establish more universal and reliable models capable of applying in a wide variety of conditions.
A recurrent theme in the literature published investigations, the artificial intelligence (AI) approach has progressively opened a new road in alleviating the foregoing problems in various fields of study including petroleum engineering. There is a wealth of investigations undertaken to model the physical properties of the CO2-oil mixtures by employing diverse AI techniques. Emera and Sarma [41] represented a relationship between CO2-oil MMP and three input variables including temperature, MWC7+, and the ratio of the light to intermediate components by utilizing the Genetic Algorithm (GA) methodology. Chen et al. [42] integrated the back propagation neural network (BPNN) with GA to predict CO2-oil MMP as a function of ten input variables encompassing temperature, Xvolatile (mole fraction of the volatile oil components), Xintermediate (mole fraction of the intermediate oil components), XC5-C6 (mole fraction of C5–C6 oil components), MWC7+, XCO2 in solvent, XC1 in solvent, XN2 in solvent, XH2S in solvent, and XC2–C4 in solvent. Kamari et al. [43], prognosticated CO2-live oil MMP based on Gene Expression Programing (GEP), in which TC (critical temperature), TR (reservoir temperature), MWC5+, and Vol:/Int. (ratio of volatile to intermediate components) were considered as the correlating parameters. Emera and Sarma [28] supplemented their work by generating multiple GA-derived correlations to estimate other physical properties of CO2-oil mixtures such as density, viscosity, swelling factor, and solubility. They correlated CO2-oil solubility in terms of temperature (T, °C), saturation pressure (Ps, MPa), bubble point pressure (Pb, MPa), MWo, and liquefaction pressure of CO2 (Pliq., MPa). The correlations were generated in accordance to oil and CO2 states as follows:
•GA-derived expressions for CO2-dead oil solubility
When addressing CO2 in its gaseous state (T > Tc,CO2 and all P; T < Tc,CO2 and P < Pliq.):(4)Rsmolefraction=2.238-0.33y+3.235y0.6474-4.8y0.25656where y=γ0.006897(1.8T+32)0.8Psexp(1/MWo).
When addressing CO2 in its liquid state (T < Tc,CO2 and P > Pliq.):(5)Rsmolefraction=0.033+1.14y-0.7716y2+0.217y3-0.02183y4where y=γPsPliq.exp(1.8T+32MWo).
•GA-derived expressions for CO2-live oil solubility
When addressing CO2 in its gaseous state (T > Tc,CO2 and all P; T < Tc,CO2 and P < Pliq.):(6)Rsmolefraction=1.748-0.5632y+3.273y0.704-4.3y0.4425where y=γ0.006897(1.8T+32)1.125Ps-Pbexp(1/MWo).
The same mathematical expression as Eq. (5) could be utilized when dealing with CO2 in its liquid state (T < Tc,CO2 and P > Pliq.).
A closer look at the CO2-oil solubility modeling was carried out in the work of Rostami et al. [1], which manipulated the GEP approach to approximate the Rs parameter in terms of T (°C), Ps (MPa), Pb (MPa), γ, and MW (g/mole). The model execution was led to the following correlations for the dead and live crudes:
