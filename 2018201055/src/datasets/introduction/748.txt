Holographic display is regarded as the ideal three-dimensional (3D) display since it can record and reconstruct the whole light field of a 3D scene [1], [2], [3]. With the developments of computer and spatial light modulator(SLM), a real-time dynamic 3D display can be realized without physical recording materials. However, due to the space-band-width of existing SLMs is generally not high, the viewing angle or the field of view (FOV) of the reconstructed image is always not large enough for observation [4], [5], [6].
There have been many researches reported on increasing the viewing angle of the reconstructed image. The high-order diffraction method expands the viewing angle by combining the high-order reconstructed beams sequentially [7]. However, due to the combination of different orders of diffraction light, the gray scale of the reconstructed image is not uniform. The resolution redistribution method enhances the viewing angle by increasing the horizontal resolution of a SLM [8], [9]. However, this method expands the horizontal viewing angle by sacrificing the vertical viewing angle. The scanning method realizes large size and large viewing angle reconstruction by using the scanner [10], [11], [12]. Nevertheless, this method requires a high frame rate of the SLM, while the imaging accuracy is affected by the scanning system. Besides, K. Wakunami et al. proposed a projection-type see-through holographic three-dimensional display with enlarged viewing angle and display size [13], but the eye-box is sacrificed at the same time [14]. Y. Su et al. proposed using a grating to improve the viewing angle, however the resolution is decreased since the SLM is divided into two regions to display different holograms [15].
Multi-SLMs method is also an effective method to expand the viewing angle of holographic display [16], [17], [18], [19]. Generally, the diffraction pattern on the hologram plane of an object can be seen as the superposition of the wavefronts emitted by all point light source (PLSs) [20], [21], [22], [23]. When the size of the SLM is not large enough to load the whole diffraction pattern, some light rays of large angles emitted by the object cannot be recorded and reconstructed which makes the viewing angle limited. Multiple SLMs in a planar configuration are used to load the whole diffraction pattern and the viewing angle is expanded since the size of the hologram is increased. However, multiple SLMs bring much increased cost. And to eliminate the seams between the SLMs, a large number of beam splitters and mirrors are used in this system. Thus, the optical system of this method is complicated and takes up a lot of space. It is not practical in some cases such as in a holographic head mounted display system [24], [25].
In this paper, we propose simply using boundary folding mirrors to increase the viewing angle of a holographic system. In the recording process, the light rays of large angle which cannot be recorded using a single SLM are reflected to the hologram by the adopted boundary folding mirrors. Therefore, the diffraction pattern is folded by these mirrors. In other words, the size of the SLM is equivalently expanded since additional virtual regions effectively exist in the mirror folded regions. During the reconstruction process, some of the diffracted light rays modulated by the SLM which are not involved in reconstructing the 3D objects before are recollected and used now. It means the spatial bandwidth of the SLM is increased equivalently. Hence, the equivalently expanded SLM using proposed method can record and reconstruct light rays of more angles which makes the viewing angle increased. Superior to the multiple SLMs method, the proposed method takes up less space and costs less since only one SLM and several mirrors are needed in our system. And this method can be easily adopted in a holographic head mounted display. Experiments prove that the proposed method is effective.
