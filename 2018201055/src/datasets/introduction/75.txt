The cryptographic primitives, such as signcryption, are used to build protocols that provide specific security services such as on-line transactions while protecting the integrity and confidentiality of the user’s data. The purpose of signcryption is to combine signature with encryption in one step, it is more efficient than the sign-and-encryption scheme. Signcryption was initially proposed by Yuliang Zheng, it can combine digital signature with public-key encryption, but it outperforms traditional sign-and-encryption scheme in efficiency significantly. Signcryption can be widely used in many areas, for example, safety communication [1], [2], [3], [4], mobile networks [5], [6], [7], [8], e-payment, mobile agent protocol [9], blockchain [10], [11], [12], cloud computing [13], [14], [15], edge computing [16] and smart cities [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23] et al. It can also improve the security of android systems [24]. Scholars proposed some signcryption schemes on the hard problem of bilinear pairings [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30] and the discrete logarithm problem (DLP) on the elliptic curve [31], [32]. But these schemes constructed on the DLP are weak to defeat the quantum attack. Though the signcryption can guarantee the confidentiality of messages, it cannot allow the original signcrypter to authorize the proxy signcrypter to sign on messages instead of the original signcrypter.
Proxy signature allows a proxy signer to sign on a message instead of an original signer. However, the proxy signature cannot guarantee messages’ confidentiality [33]. Proxy signcryption can guarantee the confidentiality of messages. Meanwhile, proxy signcryption can achieve the functions of proxy signature and signcryption. Lu et al. constructed a new identity-based proxy signature scheme (IDPS) on the lattice, its security relies on the small integer solution problem (SIS), it can achieve message recovery [34]. Lin et al. proposed a linearly homomorphic proxy signature, which can be used in e-business and cloud computing [35]. Zhu et al. presented a new IDPS on the NTRU lattice, its security relies on Ring-SIS problem [33]. Ehmet et al. extended proxy signature’s application to multi-proxy multi-signature, they defined a group, which contains all original signers, their scheme’s security is based on RSA [36]. However, these proxy signature schemes cannot protect data’s confidentiality.
Identity-based cryptography allows users’ identities to be their public keys and generates their secret keys by using their public keys, which was introduced by shamer [37], [38]. Later, scholars proposed different signature schemes based on identity-based cryptography [39], [40]. Besides, identity-based cryptography can also be used in blockchain, etc.
Identity-based proxy signcryption (IDPSC) has the advantages of identity-based cryptography, proxy signature, and signcrypion. Based on the bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption, scholars constructed some IDPSC schemes [25], [41].
However, these schemes are constructed on the DLP and the integer factoring problems [42], [43], which cannot defeat quantum attack [44], [45]. The lattice-based cryptography can be an alternative solution for its high efficiency and anti-quantum ability since there are still none efficient quantum algorithms to attack lattice-based cryptography. Our contributions are as follows:
A lattice-based IDPSC scheme is constructed, its security is analyzed, i.e., it satisfies IND-CCA2, sUF-CMA. Meanwhile, it has the security properties of the proxy signature. Comparing the proposed IDPSC’s performance with the others, the proposed IDPSC scheme outperforms other existing IDPSC schemes in computation complexity, secret key size and signature tuple size. The paper is organized as follows:
Section 2 reviews the background of lattice and IDPSC. Section 3 constructs the new IDPSC scheme. Section 4 analyzes the security of the constructed scheme and compares its performance with other IDPSC schemes. Section 5 concludes the paper.
