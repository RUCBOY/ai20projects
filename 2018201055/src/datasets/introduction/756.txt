Magneto-optical and ferromagnetic-material studies are of current interest [1], [2], [3], [4]. Magneto-optics has been known to deal with the phenomena associated with magnetic effects on matter as it emits light, having the potential applications in computer data-storage and waveguides, and to cope with the influence of the magnetic field upon matter, in the process of emitting or absorbing light [3], [4]. Magneto-optic effect has been seen as the one in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through a medium that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field [3], [4]. Ferromagnetic materials have been named as the materials displaying ferromagnetism, such as the various forms of iron, steel, cobalt, nickel, and their alloys [1], [2]. In addition, fluid mechanics has been concerned with the mechanics of liquids, gases, and plasmas, and the forces on them [5], [6], [7]; plasma physics has been concerned with matter in its plasma phase, while plasmas have been seen as by far the most common phase of ordinary matter in the Universe, both by mass and by volume [8].
In magneto-optics, ferromagnetism, fluid mechanics and plasma physics, for the electromagnetic waves in a ferromagnetic material, or water waves, or dust-acoustic/ion-acoustic/dust–ion-acoustic waves in a plasma, we need to consider the following generalized (3+1)-dimensional variable-coefficient modified Kadomtsev–Petviashvili (mKP) system: (1a)ut+μ1(t)uxxx−μ2(t)u2ux+μ3(t)uxv+μ4(t)vy+μ5(t)uxw+μ6(t)wz=0,(1b)vx=uy,wx=uz,
 where u(x,y,z,t), v(x,y,z,t) and w(x,y,z,t) are the real differentiable functions of the variables x, y, z and t, (2)μ1(t)≠0,μ2(t)≠0,
μ3(t), μ4(t), μ5(t) and μ6(t) are all the real differentiable functions of t. In magneto-optics, ferromagnetism, fluid mechanics and plasma physics, there have appeared some special cases of System (1): (A) an mKP system in magneto-optics, for the electromagnetic waves in an isotropic charge-free infinite ferromagnetic thin film with the potential application in magneto-optic recording [9], [10], [11], [12],1  when μ1(t)=1, μ2(t)=32, μ3(t)=μ4(t)=0, μ5(t)=−3 and μ6(t)=3, in which u(x,z,t) represents the first derivative of the angle made between the uniform magnetization of the medium2 . with respect to x and the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave, with t meaning the scaled stretched time, x meaning the stretched wave variable with the assumption that the electromagnetic wave propagates along a given direction on the x−z plane, and z meaning the scaled stretched variable along the normal z direction [11]; (B) an mKP system for the ion-acoustic waves in a plasma with non-isothermal electrons [9], [10], [13], [14], or the water waves on the (x,y) plane [9], [10], [15], [16], when μ1(t)=−14, μ2(t)=−32, μ3(t)=±32, μ4(t)=−34 and μ5(t)=μ6(t)=0, in which u(x,y,t) means the amplitude or elevation of the relevant wave, with (x,y) and t meaning the scaled space and time coordinates, respectively [10]; (C) a variable-coefficient mKP equation [17], when μ5(t)=μ6(t)=0; (D) a (3+1)-dimensional mKP equation for a collisionless multi-component plasma conceiving two-temperature electrons and cold ions with the different Maxwellian distributions rendered in the form of two Boltzmann relations [18], [19],3  when μ1(t)=B, μ2(t)=A, μ3(t)=0, μ4(t)=D, μ5(t)=0 and μ6(t)=D, in which A, B and D are the real constants related to the phase velocity of the plasma-acoustic mode and the normalized electron densities at the equilibrium state with the charge neutrality condition maintained, etc., u(x,y,z,t) represents the first-order perturbation of the normalized electrostatic potential, with x, y, z and t representing the space–time stretching coordinates [18]; (E) an mKP equation for the dust-acoustic waves in a cold, collisionless, unmagnetized and two-ion-temperature dusty plasma with electrons, low-temperature ions, high-temperature ions and extremely-massive highly-negatively-charged, differently-sized dust grains [20]; (F) an mKP equation for the dust–ion-acoustic waves in a magnetized dusty plasma whose components are certain nonextensive-velocity-distributed electrons, massive dust grains and negatively charged ions [21]. More relevant nonlinear physics issues can be seen, e.g., in optical fiber communication, in Refs. [22], [23], [24].
To our knowledge, however, there have been no bilinear-form, Bäcklund-transformation and soliton papers for System (1) published as yet. In Section 2 of this paper, with symbolic computation [25], [26], we will construct two auto-Bäcklund transformations with some soliton features. In Section 3, using the Hirota method [27] and symbolic computation, we will work out some bilinear forms for System (1) with N solitons, where N is a positive integer. Conclusions will be given in Section 4.
