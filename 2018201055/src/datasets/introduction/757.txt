Evolutionary biology is concerned, among other major things, about understanding what forces influence speciation and extinction processes, and how they affect macroevolution [1]. In order to do so, there has been a natural interest in the development of techniques and measures whose goal is to assess the imprint of these forces in what has become the standard representation of joint evolutionary histories of groups of species: phylogenetic trees [2], [3], [4]. There are two aspects of a phylogenetic tree that can expose such an imprint: its branch lengths – determined by the timing of speciation events – and its shape, or topology —which, in turn, is determined by the differences in the diversification rates among clades [5, Chap. 33]. But, as it turns out, the accurate reconstruction of branch lengths associating, to a given phylogenetic tree, a robust timeline is not straightforward [6] while, on the other hand, phylogenetic reconstruction methods over the same empirical data tend to agree on the topology of the reconstructed tree [7], [8], [9]. Therefore, the shape of phylogenetic trees has become the focus of most of the studies performed on this topic, be it via the definition of indices quantifying topological features – see, for instance, [3], [10], [11] and the references on balance indices given below – or the frequency distribution of small rooted subtrees [12], [13], [14], [15].
In his 1922 paper, Yule [16] first observed that taxonomic trees have a tendency towards asymmetry, with most clades being small and only a few of them large at every taxonomic level. Thus, balance, understood as the propensity of the children of any given node to have the same number of descendant leaves, has become the most popular topological measure used to describe the topology of a phylogenetic tree. Therefore, per negationem, the imbalance of a phylogenetic tree gives a measure of the tendency of diversification events to occur mostly along specific lineages [11], [17]. Several such measures have been proposed, in order to quantify the balance (or, in many cases, the imbalance) of a phylogenetic tree, and they are referred to in the literature as balance indices. For example, see [10], [11], [12], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24] and the section “Measures of overall asymmetry” in [5] (pp. 562–563).
For instance, these indices have then been thoroughly used in order to test the validity evolutionary models [3], [21], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]; to assess possible biases in the distribution of shapes that are obtained through different phylogenetic tree reconstruction methods [30], [31], [32], [33], [34]; to compare tree shapes [35], [36], [37]; as a tool to discriminate between input parameters in phylogenetic tree simulations [38], [39]; or simply to describe phylogenies existing in the literature [40], [41], [42], [43].
Introduced in [18], the Colless index has become one of the most popular balance indices in the literature. Given a bifurcating tree T, it is defined as the sum, over all internal nodes v in T, of the absolute value of the difference between the numbers of descendant leaves of the pair of children of v (even so, there exists a recent extension to multifurcating trees, see [23]). Its popularity springs from several sources. First of all, its antiquity: it is one of the first balance indices found in the literature, dating back to 1982. Secondly, the way it measures the “global imbalance” by adding the “local imbalances” of each internal node in T is fairly intuitive. Finally, it has been classified as one of the most powerful tree shape statistics in goodness-of-fit tests of probabilistic models of phylogenetic trees [21], [44], [45], as well as one of the most shape-discriminant balance indices [46].
Due to this popularity, the statistical properties of the Colless index under several probabilistic models have been thoroughly studied [47], [48], [49], [50] as well as its maximum [23] and minimum [51] values. The characterization of this last value, as well as that of the trees attaining it, apart from recent turns out to be rather complex and fails to shed light on the intuitive concept of balance. Indeed, other balance indices, such as the total cophenetic index [22] and the rooted quartet index rQI [19] classify as “most balanced” trees only those that are maximally balanced, in the sense that the imbalance of each internal node is either 0 or 1. Even though these trees are effectively considered to be “most balanced” by the Colless index, they are seldom the only ones being so considered.
In this manuscript, we introduce a modification of the Colless index that offers some benefits over the original definition, consisting in squaring the difference of the number of descendant leaves to each child of an internal node instead of considering its absolute value. On the one hand, we have been able to compute both its expected value and its variance under the Yule and uniform probabilistic models for phylogenetic trees. In contrast, notice that the expected value of the Colless index under the uniform model is still unknown in the literature. On the other hand, its maximum and minimum values are attained exactly at the caterpillars and the maximally balanced trees, respectively, and the proofs of these results are rather easy—more so when compared to those concerning the Colless index. Furthermore, it proves to be less prone to have ties between different trees than any other balance index in the literature is, as well as more shape-discriminant than any of the balance indices tested in [46] are.
Before leaving the Introduction, we want to note that, even though the Colless index, as well as other indices, was invented for its application to the description and analysis of phylogenetic trees, it is a shape index, i.e. one whose value does not depend on the specific labels associated to the leaves of the tree, but on its underlying topological features. Thus, in the rest of this manuscript we will restrict ourselves to unlabelled trees.
