Many civil engineering applications require to precisely locate cracks, either to then repair them or to assess the health of the structure. In particular, cracks in pavements for roads, airport runways / taxiways or other situations can reduce the serviceable life of the pavement significantly [1]. For these reasons, pavement crack detection has attracted significant attention lately [[2], [3], [4], [5], [6]]. However, most of the effort has been dedicated to detection of the presence of cracks [[7], [8], [9], [10]] and less to measuring its characteristics. Only few methods exist [[11], [12], [13]] but their cost and complexity reduces the frequency of their use and limits the applicability to less critical infrastructure. This infrastructure is typically under-invested in for maintenance purposes, and therefore shows greater defects such as cracks resulting in poorer performance.
Additionally, the poor localisation of cracks prevents this valuable information for being accurately incorporated into asset management processes, not least those managed or making use of Building Information Modelling (BIM) techniques [14]. Other more accurate localisation solutions have been presented in [[15], [16], [17], [18]]. These are mostly based on computer vision techniques applied to images. However, these systems can be ‘too successful’ in detecting multiple cracks and therefore result in multiple false positives. Hence, a cost-effective technique that can help to accurately localise cracks and reduce false positives, would be of great use. The remainder of the paper will focus on image-based crack detection and measurement.
The literature of image-based crack detection is quite large, therefore, we will only focus on work done for accurate crack localisation (which has also been termed as quantification or discretisation in the literature) and we have defined here as the identification of crack pixels within an image.
Crack detection from 2D visual image information can be broadly classified into geometric model-based and deep learning approaches. The model-based approaches may exploit one or more basic image processes such as edge detection, segmentation, morphological operations and texture analysis to extract crack features from the images [19]. There have been several attempts, in the model-based approach, to improve the reliability of crack detection using image pre-processing and different kinds of spatial smoothing. This can reduce image noise and hence improve the crack detection results. Pre-processing steps may include median filters, opening and closing morphological filters to join crack segments [[20], [21], [22], [23]].
Cracks on concrete surfaces were quantified in [[24], [25], [26]] with the objective of estimating crack width and length rather than the accurate localization for a consequent repair task. Cracks were discretized in [27] using the minimal path selection concept to improve crack detection against the imperfection of incomplete and sparse crack segments.
Deep learning approaches on the other hand, can learn the process from end to end using neural networks trained using hundreds of labelled/annotated images [17,[28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]] Recent developments in the deep learning showed good results through pixelwise segmentation with Unet models [[38], [39], [40]]. Several commercial crack identification systems have been tested in the field and reported to have problems with non-crack features present on the road surface, including joints, patches, road markings, resulting in high number of false positives in the reported cracks than those present in the reference data [41]. Since the main issue with crack detection is the appearance of noise, and consequently the increase of false positives, our research strategy aims to explore ways to enhance both the crack detection noise tolerance and accurate localisation.
Oliveira et al. [18] developed the CrackIT algorithm to detect road cracks and characterize them into basic types. It has two modes of operation: (1) pixel-based that segments the crack but is sensitive to noise and, (2) block-based to determine whether the block contains a crack or not but whilst it is noise tolerant it does not accurately localise cracks.
In this paper, the benefits of combining crackIT's two modes of crack detection (pixel-based and block-based) are explored to develop a robust method that can achieve both accurate localisation and a low level of false positives induced by noise. This is the first most critical step towards the use of crack information for asset management, leaving the image localisation outside the scope of this paper as it requires different techniques.
The paper is structured as follows: the next section describes the CrackIT methods and its modes of operation briefly together with the proposed combined method. The experiment conditions, metrics and comparison with pixel-based method are presented in Section 3 using the CrackIT image dataset. The proposed method is then compared with three deep learning methods running on three crack image datasets and the results are presented in Section 4. The results are discussed in Section 5 and conclusions are finally drawn in Section 6.
