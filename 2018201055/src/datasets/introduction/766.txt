Composite coatings consisting of hard phases of carbides embedded in a tough metal matrix phase have a wide range of engineering applications, due to their improved mechanical and tribological properties. They are also among the most extensively researched coatings. Deposits containing a solid lubricant improve the surface characteristics in comparison with the substrate properties and are widely used in tribological applications to reduce wear or to modify friction during contact [[1], [2], [3]]. Cr3C2-NiCr based cermet coatings exhibit improved performance due to the combination of the Cr3C2 carbide phase, which causes wear resistance, and the NiCr metal phase, which provides corrosion resistance [4]. The performance of Cr3C2-NiCr coatings depends on their thermal stability behaviour. They may be used in various applications involving sliding, abrasion and erosion over a wide range of temperatures up to 900 °C [[5], [6], [7], [8], [9]]. Plasma spraying (APS) and high-velocity oxygen-fuel spraying (HVOF) are the most effective industrial technologies to produce these cermet coatings [1,[10], [11], [12], [13], [14]]. However, these processes are conducted at high temperatures, which could melt the used feedstock, leading to significant changes in the phase composition of produced coatings. During the above-mentioned processes, changes take place throughout the microstructure, resulting in embrittlement of the material caused by dissolution of the carbide into the binder phase [4,6,10,[15], [16], [17]]. However, applying the cold spray technique allows composite deposits to be produced with the same phase composition as the used feedstock powder. The cold spraying is conducted at room temperature, eliminating the unfavourable effect of high temperatures, such as the form of oxides, phase transformations, and carbide dissolution, etc. [[18], [19], [20]]. In this process, the carbide loss is related to the partial rebounding of carbide particles upon impact with the substrate or previously deposited particles. When carbide particles crack upon impact, some are lost because of weak bonding between them and are blown away by the gas stream. This causes a significantly lower carbide particle content in the coatings than in the feedstock. The mechanical properties of cold sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr deposits are a little worse than coatings sprayed by APS or HVOF, as was shown in previous studies [21,22]. Wolfe et al. [21] showed that Cr3C2-25(Ni20Cr) coatings produced from an agglomerated and sintered TAFA 1375 V powder reveal hardness in the range of 277 HV0.3 to 575 HV0.3. The coatings made from blended Cr3C2-25(Ni20Cr) (Diamalloy 3004) powder show slightly higher values, as reported by Trelka et al. (635 HV0.3), Góral et al. (641 HV0.3), and Singh et al. (875.67 HV0.2) [[22], [23], [24]]. The hardness of the cold sprayed coatings is influenced by the carbide loss during deposition, the size and distribution of the carbide particles in the deposit, and the work hardening effect caused by the impact of particles and high plastic deformation of metallic particles. Therefore, additional surface treatment is used to obtain the coating properties in the strictly defined layer depth. Modification of the surface layer may extend coating lifetimes and reliability at higher operating temperatures and wear conditions. Laser treatment causes significant changes in the heat-treated zone microstructure and phase composition, and affects the resulting properties [[25], [26], [27], [28]]. Studies regarding the laser modifications of plasma-, HVOF- and HVAF-sprayed Cr3C2-NiCr coatings are available in the literature [15,29,30] however, there are no papers concerning these types of deposits produced using the cold spray technique. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of different laser treatment powers on the microstructure, mechanical properties, residual stresses and surface topography of Cr3C2-25(Ni20Cr)-(Ni-graphite) cold sprayed coatings on the 7075 Al substrate.
