Ghost imaging [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] which reconstructs an unknown object by the correlation properties between two correlated beams, has attracted much attention because of its non-local property. In traditional ghost imaging (TGI) system, the object beam is usually collected by a bucket detector with no spatial resolution, and the reference beam is detected by a detector with spatial resolution, such as the charge-coupled device (CCD). The object can be reconstructed by measuring the intensity fluctuation correlation between the two detectors [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. To improve imaging speed and imaging quality, ghost imaging technology has been widely investigated and combined with many new methods recently, such as compressive sensing GI [15], [16], [17], pseudo-inverse GI [18], normalized GI [19], spatial low-pass filtering [20], [21], [22], single-pixel imaging [23], [24], deep-learning GI [25] and so on.
As we all know, TGI requires a lot of measurements to reconstruct high quality ghost-image. During this process, the acquirement, storage and transmission of large amount of data can affect imaging speed. For this problem, binarization ghost imaging (BGI) is put forward [26], [27], [28], [29]. Chen et al. indicated that grayscale object authentication based on ghost imaging using binary signals can possess a potential for advancing ghost imaging [26]. While, imaging quality by BGI is poor than that by TGI because the binary process is inevitably accompanied by the loss of information. To solve this problem, the group of Guo proposed a scheme in which imaging quality can be improved effectively by adding suitable random noise to the raw data before quantization [28], and our group demonstrated experimentally that Otsu binary ghost imaging (OBGI) can achieve a better imaging quality when compared with TGI [29]. In fact, the detail reconstruction for imaging object in the two works is not good. Note that edge detection based on ghost imaging which has been proposed recently, can present the detail edge information [30], [31], but the low-frequency information is ignored.
In this paper, we present a new local-binary ghost imaging by point-by-point method (PPBGI). The basic idea of this method is to obtain the threshold corresponding to the current pixel point by comprehensively using the information of other pixel points, instead of simply using the fixed threshold to perform the binarization. It is shown that the details of the imaging object can be accurately reconstructed by setting the segmentation threshold corresponding to each pixel, which leads to the target information obtained by our method is richer than that from TGI. In addition, we also give a qualitative explanation of this phenomenon.
