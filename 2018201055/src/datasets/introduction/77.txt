The use of screen devices in everyday life is becoming more common even at a young age [18]. Excessive screen time has been recognized as a public health concern because it has been found to associate with increased risks of being obese [8,28], lower psychosocial wellbeing, and attention problems among children aged 3–5 years [5,17,20]. Insufficient sleep and irregular sleep habits in preschool children have been associated with obesity [23], behavioral problems [29,34], and compromised physical and mental health [10]. Sufficient sleep and healthy sleep habits are crucial for healthy growth and development, especially in the early years [6].
Studies have shown associations between increased screen time and poor sleep outcomes, such as sleep disturbances [3,26] and irregular sleep habits in children under school age [2,12]. Previous studies have investigated whether screen time affects sleep by reducing sleep duration (a sleep displacement process) or by shifting both bedtimes and wake-up times later, resulting in a delayed circadian rhythm (a sleep time shifting process). Some studies have reported that screen time is associated with reduced sleep duration in preschool children [26,27,29]. In addition Belmon et al. [1], found moderate evidence for screen time as a determinant for decreased sleep duration in the age group of 4–12 years in their review of longitudinal studies. However, not all studies have confirmed this finding. The cross-sectional study by Hense et al. [16] found no clear evidence for decreased sleep duration. In contrast [2], Beyens’s and Nathanson’s study suggested that, instead of decreasing sleep duration, screen time shifts bedtimes and wake-up times later in preschool children. Nonetheless, Moorman's [24] review was supposedly the first review concerning screen time and sleep among preschool children and concluded that screen time negatively impacts sleep outcomes, such as sleep duration and bedtimes.
Screen time can affect sleep through several mechanisms [4]. Using screens in the evening has been found to be a specific risk factor for sleep problems, because screen time can cause delay of the circadian rhythm [11,24]. Delay of the circadian rhythm can be caused because exposure to blue light in the evening disrupts melatonin production [9]. Also stimulating content of the screens can delay sleep onset latency, due to increased psychophysiological arousal and activation of the autonomic nervous system [4]. In addition, screen time can postpone going to bed, because it is time-consuming, and can also replace soothing bedtime rituals [4,11]. Using screens in the bedroom has been found to be associated with sleep problems [11] due to the conditioned learning effect between screen time and bedroom [15]. Among young adults, prolonged screen time has been observed to cause physical discomfort, which results in sleep problems [31].
Review by Moorman [24] revealed the lack of studies concerning smartphone and tablet use, as the majority of review studies included TV and computer use, but only a scatter of studies also included smartphone or tablet use. Studies have mostly used questions directed to parents to estimate children's screen time and sleep habits on a weekly average, and there is a need for more accurate screening methods such as time diaries [2]. As the use of all kinds of screen devices is becoming more common in young children, more information is needed on accurate methods to analyze how screen time and the use of screen devices, including smartphones and tablets, are associated with sleep habits in young children.
This study aims to examine the association between screen time and sleep habits in a sample of Finnish preschool children. The research questions are: 1) Is the amount of screen time associated with bedtimes, wake-up times, sleep duration, and sleep consistency in preschool children (analyzed separately for total, weekday, and weekend)?; and 2) Is there an independent association of the use of each screen device (TV, computer, smartphones, or tablets) with sleep habits? In addition, we examine whether the studied associations differ between genders.
