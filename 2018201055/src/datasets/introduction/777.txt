In recent years, we have witnessed a rapid development of complex network analysis, which is a multidisciplinary approach to study complex systems. A complex network is a powerful tool to characterize several different types of natural and man-made systems, such as brain networks [1], [2], computer science [3], [4], Internet topology [5], [6], and social networks [7], [8]. The complex network helps us to comprehend complex systems that have many components interacting with each other so that we can model, predict and control them. In some real complex systems, we cannot obtain all the interactions or correlations among the elements. From this perspective, the complex network provides us with a way to describe and build the relationships of system components and discover its internal mechanism.
Many scientists have proved that complex interactions and correlations exist in the seismic system in the past decades [9], [10], [11]. The concept of earthquake network was introduced to seismology by Abe and Suzuki [12] in 2004. They proposed an approach to construct a time series-based earthquake network describing the correlations between successive events. They only considered the successive events in the catalogue and did not consider other specific physical quantities of the epicentres, such as seismic wave and seismic moment. This is strikingly reminiscent of the introduction of the concept of natural time [13], [14] which is just based on the order of the appearance of successive events in the catalogue. Abe and Suzuki divided a particular geographical region into small equal-sized cells and linked them when successive events occurred within them. They have proved that the networks have the properties of scale-free [12] and small-world [15]. After that, many researchers began to use earthquake networks to do plenty of valuable work. They constructed earthquake network by proposing different approaches [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and studied different properties [21], [22], [23], [24], [25] of the earthquake network. Douglas [19] proposed a time window-based method to construct a global earthquake network. Xuan [18] proposed a space–time influence domain method to construct earthquake network considering the time, location and magnitude of the earthquakes. Other researchers proposed other construction methods, such as similar activity patterns [16], mutual information [17], and hybrid model [20]. They also found many valuable properties of earthquake network. For instance, they found the preferential attachment [23] in evolutionary earthquake networks. Furthermore, the researchers found that the networks are hierarchically organized and assortatively mixed [25]. Especially, some researchers used k-cores for facilitating earthquake prediction, which highlights the important approach of using complex network for seismicity [26].
However, even though various valuable work has been done by the researchers from the perspective of a complex network, we have minimal work on the weighted earthquake network. The weighted network representation allows the consideration of the dynamic or flows occurring on networks. Here, the weight represents the strength of links between nodes. The bigger the weight is, the more active interactions in the systems are. The weighted earthquake will add another dimension in the description of the earthquake network. In Ref. [27], the authors found different links of the network constructed by time sequence appear with highly different strengths. They also found that different properties of the weighted network are quite different from those of their un-weighted counterparts.
Recently, the authors have improved the work done in [12] by modifying the way to construct the earthquake network [18]. To do that, they have defined a space–time influence domain to connect different nodes, where the node corresponding to the first event is linked to all the nodes within its space–time influence domain forming the unweighted earthquake network. The authors find the scale-free and small-world nature of earthquake network and use k-core decomposition to study the centrality of earthquake network.
In our previous study, we found that the properties of weighted earthquake network based on different construction methods present differently in some aspects. We believe that it is necessary to study the weighted network based on different construction methods. Therefore, in this paper, we study the network properties and dynamic evolution of weighted earthquake network based on space–time influence domain and consider the issue of how dynamics and weighted structure affect the primary network properties.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the weighted network construction method is introduced in detail. The data used in our study and the relevant network information and visualization are also given in this section. The results and detailed analysis are presented in Section 3. Finally, in Section 4, the conclusions of this paper are presented.
