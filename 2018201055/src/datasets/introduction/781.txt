Social networks have become popular as a medium for disseminating information and interacting with others. The public accessibility of these networks with the ability to share information, opinions, and experience offers great promise to companies and governments. Social networks are used by companies and governments to deliver their services to customers and citizens. These networks are intrinsically non-deterministic, and topological structures and human behaviors in them have time-varying nature. As a result, using a static graph model with fixed weights for social networks is too simplistic and restrictive for many real-world network problems. Authors in [1] were the first to address the dynamicity of edge weights in social networks and propose using stochastic graphs, in which edge weights are random variables with unknown distributions, for modeling and analyzing these networks. They presented new generalizations of some graph measures for stochastic networks and proposed several learning automata-based algorithms for calculating these measures. Very recently, some research works have been dedicated to solving various problems on stochastic social networks [2], [3], [4], [5].
Trust is considered a vital factor in online social networks. The success of social interactions depends on the level of trust that users have with each other as well as with service providers. In this way, trust influences the quality of interactions in social networks and reduces uncertainties and risks from unreliable users. From the other side, the experience of users in their interactions also affects the level of trust between them in such a way that trust increases between users if the experience is positive and decreases otherwise. As a result, dynamicity is an important property of social trust.
Various techniques have been used in literature for addressing the dynamicity property of the trust, for example, using temporal window [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], aging of old interactions [11], [12], [13], giving more weight to recent interactions [14], [15], [16], periodically computing the value of trust [17], [18] and considering only the most recent interaction [19], [20]. However, even though the dynamic nature of trust has been widely accepted in the literature, most works in this scope have been modeled trust networks as static digraphs and developed deterministic algorithms for solving problems on these networks [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. In this paper, we propose that a stochastic graph can better represent trust networks with respect to the dynamicity property of the trust, and therefore it is a more accurate model for these networks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the concept of a stochastic trust network as a model for trust networks.
Since online social networks have gained more popularity among internet users in recent years, computer scientists and sociologists have started to study and analyze the characteristics of these networks. Social network analysis (SNA) as an inherently interdisciplinary field focuses on social relations between users rather in the users themselves. The main purpose of SNA is to study both contents and patterns of relations in online social networks to understand the implications of these social relations. Trust networks are of the most important directed and weighted social networks. There exist different generalizations of the original graph measures proposed in the literature, which in addition to considering the topological structure, also address directionality and weights of connections. However, since these generalizations have been designed with different types of networks in mind, despite having the same goal they behave quite differently from each other. As a result, when studying a network of a special type, the first and most important challenge is that which definitions must be adopted among several existing various definitions. To tackle the challenge of selecting measures, we survey the literature for the existing graph measure generalizations, and choose the most appropriate of them with respect to the properties of trust. Wherever it is necessary, we also propose new definitions of measures, considering the topological structure, the directionality, and the trust weights assigned to connections in a trust network.
In addition to the challenge of selecting graph measures, there exist many other factors that make it difficult, if not impossible, to study social networks in their entirety. First and foremost, the huge size of many real-world networks makes it computationally infeasible to study the entire network. Moreover, some online networks are not completely visible to the public (e.g., Facebook) or can be accessed only through crawling (e.g., Web). In other cases, the size of networks may not be as large but the measurements required to observe the underlying networks are costly. As a result, network sampling is at the heart and foundation of the study for understanding network structure.
The main goal of network sampling is to produce representative subgraphs with a smaller size which can be used to make inferences about the full graph. Many network sampling methods have been developed in the literature [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44]. However, these methods attempt to only match the structural properties of the original graph and in the case of weighted graphs, they ignore edge weights through their sampling process. This is while many social networks include weights associated with their edges to differentiate the edges in terms of their strength or capacity [45]. Moreover, the edge weights in many of these networks change over time, indicating the non-deterministic nature of these networks. Authors in [1] proposed that stochastic graphs, in which edge weights are random variables with unknown distributions, can better represent social networks. Very recently, some research works have been dedicated to sampling subgraphs from weighted [46] and stochastic [3] social networks.
In this paper, we also develop a dynamic sampling algorithm based on learning automata for stochastic trust networks, whose sampled subgraphs can accurately preserve our trust-specific measures. The proposed algorithm, called D-LAFS, is an extension of the Frontier sampling algorithm (m-dimensional random walk sampling) [43] which uses m dependent random walkers. It has been shown that sampling methods based on random walks performs best for preserving the properties of the original graph [47]. However, in the presence of disconnected or loosely connected original graphs, Random walks can suffer from large estimation errors [43]. Therefore, authors in [43] proposed a new m-dimensional random walk sampling method and indicated that this method, called Frontier sampling, exhibits lower estimation errors while preserving all of the important sampling properties of a regular random walk.
The problem with Frontier sampling is that this method, because of using m random walkers, is probable to sample subgraphs with multiple disconnected components. Moreover, Frontier sampling does not take into consideration edge weights and thus their changes over time. To tackle these problems, the sampling algorithm D-LAFS proposed in this paper uses learning automata to guarantee the connectivity of sampled subgraphs and, at the same time, perform smart sampling for minimizing the number of samples taken from the edge weights of the original graph. In D-LAFS, learning automata are biased to high degree nodes and learn to sample connected subgraphs. Learning automata has been successfully used in the literature for graph sampling [37], [38].
To evaluate the performance of the proposed sampling algorithm, we conduct several experiments on the well-known trust network datasets. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm more accurately preserves trust-specific statistic generalizations of the original graph comparing to the dynamic version of existing sampling algorithms including Random Walk sampling and Frontier sampling, as well as stochastic sampling algorithm eDLAS-SG [3].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides background and related work on social trust, social network analysis, graph sampling, and learning automata. In Sections 3 Stochastic trust network, 4 Trust network measures, we respectively describe the proposed stochastic digraph model for trust networks and the generalizations of graph measures, namely degree, clustering coefficient, and path length. Section 5 describes the proposed dynamic algorithm for sampling from stochastic trust networks. The experimental results on well-known trust network datasets are given in Section 6. Finally, the last section discusses and concludes the paper.
