Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is generally thought of as starting with or shortly after the Manhattan project. During the last 60 years, computational aerodynamics has seen more contributions by a single individual than many institutions combined: Antony Jameson. To his credit go the FLO and SYN-series of codes, which led to first fast multigrid finite volume methods to solve the potential/full potential equations [1], [2], [3], [4], the first working multigrid finite volume methods to solve the compressible Euler equations [5], [6], [7], the first Euler Solution for a complete aircraft [8], the first working multigrid finite volume methods to solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations [9], the first airfoil/wing/wing-body design methods using adjoints of the potential/full potential, Euler and RANS equations [10], [11], [14], [15], [16], [21], the first fast solvers for low frequency transients [13], [17], and a number of groundbreaking theoretical contributions in such diverse topics as convection upwind split pressure (CUSP) schemes [12], stability theorems [19], energy conserving schemes [18] and spectral difference schemes [20].
The methods developed, as well as the style in which these were coded have been copied and implemented innumerable times throughout the world. These FLO and SYN-codes were written in a particularly clear and legible style, the ‘Jameson Style’. In the same way that we can recognize a Bach suite or a Vivaldi concerto, a CFD code from Antony Jameson is clearly recognizable.
