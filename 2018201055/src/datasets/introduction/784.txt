The tremendous growth of connected devices and the continuous demands of multi-hungry-bandwidth applications along with the breakthrough of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) are urging researchers worldwide to look for new multiplexing technologies that are able to accommodate the surge of network traffic that will soon overwhelm the capacity of multimode fiber (MMF) backbones. However, modal dispersion and mode coupling cause Intersymbol Interference (ISI), which is considered as the primary impairment of MMF as it results in bandwidth degradation and a limited range. Mode division multiplexing (MDM) has been characterized as an elegant way to capitalize on orthogonal spatially overlapping and co-propagation of modes [1], [2]. In MDM, modes are transmitted in parallel streams carrying the data independently, and then de-multiplexed in low intermodal crosstalk. Controlling the excitation of modes will help to optimize the channel impulse response such that the differential mode delay and crosstalk will be minimized [3]. Long- Period Fiber Grating (LPFG) utilizing CO2 laser technique as in [4] transformed two-mode fiber (TMF) by means of employing a direct CO2 laser writing method to fabricate LPFG. This method is one of two approaches in producing modes directly from the laser cavity [5] whereby, the CO2 laser can be programmed to generate the needed grating profile. It has been proved that the usage of LPFG is an efficient transverse mode selector once the laser operates within a narrow spectrum [6], [7]. In addition, other techniques based on LPFG such as the thermal induction technique as in [8]. The thermal induction technique has been used as a simple method to have an efficient and stabilized mode convertor from LP01to LP11, followed by mechanical pressure technique as in [9]. The conversion of the mode can be feasible through a periodic grating structure, which induced by mechanical pressure technique. Moreover, electromagnetic induction technique as in [10] has been reported as a method to change the loss amplitude of the LPFG. Without moving the phase-matching wavelength, the conversion can be realized efficiently surpassing the limitation of thermal induction. In addition, it alleviates the overall system complexity that may occur from utilizing the mechanical pleasure technique to manipulate the fiber [10]. The spatial light modulator (SLM) is another selective mode excitation approach to increase the capacity of MMF. SLM in MDM may be classified into two categories namely, SLM with a priori knowledge, and SLM without a priori knowledge which considered to be a superior approach comparing to SLM with a priori knowledge. The rapid changes in power modal coupling functions ca be adapted using SLM. Therefore, it is imperative to optimize the channel impulse response. SLM as a binary mask and lens is another approach to generate the incident field that is similar to the inherent field in MMF. SLM based demultiplexer has the capability to excite modes mode that shared azimuthal index [11].
SLM with a priori knowledge is mainly used to solve the complexity adjustment of phase-front of the beam dynamically [12], [13], [14] to produce a new wavefront that is Fourier transferred through a lens. SLM-based MDM has proved to be a significant improvement in modal bandwidth through tailoring the launch profile incident of the core of the fiber [15], [16], [17]. By controlling the modes excited, the impulse response of each channel may be optimized such that the time delays between the modes are short and the highest power is coupled into the modes with moderate time delays [18]. Specific modes of the fiber may be excited for each channel by matching the incident field of the multimode fiber to its inherent modal field [19], [20].
Although several MDM experiments have been demonstrated, the Vertical-Cavity Surface-Emitting Laser (VCSEL) is the best choice of laser and was used in this paper for accessing networks owing to its low cost, simple alignment into MMF, and ability to excite specific modes. SLM-based reconfigurable MUX/DEMUX is used to launch and receive the spatial mode, which significantly reduces the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) digital signal processing (DSP), although the number of modes is restricted by the extent of SLM [21]. Despite the use of SLM-based MUX/DEMUX, MIMO-DSP remains essential particularly for long-haul systems [22], the random perturbations in fiber that allow the interchange of power from one axial direction to another have been addressed through several significant mitigation techniques. These mitigation techniques can be categorized into strong and weak mode coupling regime. The former is typically greater than 1000 m. In this regime the mode coupling can be compensated for by intensive computational-based techniques such as MIMO-DSP and electronic dispersion compensation techniques, using different adaptive algorithms such as IPNLMS [22], [23], LMS [24], [25], RLS [26], [27], LMS/RLS [28], [29], [30], [31], and RLSCMA [32], [33]. In addition are studies employing a modulation format agnostic space-demultiplexing algorithm [34], and modulation-format independent techniques [35]. However, and inventively, MIMO-DSP complexity would increase by increasing the number of modes [28]. Weak mode coupling which is typically less than 1000 m, and experienced in utilizing computational adaptive optics feedback algorithms. In the input, these algorithms reverse the coupling suppression of the modes to produce the modes required at the output. However, these approaches are limited since mode coupling is a random process and can change in the order of milliseconds in conventional fiber [36]. Therefore the SVD technique has been studied in a wide band in MIMO wireless communication systems to treat the overlapping and signal fading which may be relevant to optical communication systems as mode coupling and modal dispersion lead to ISI [37], [38], [39].
Although we may consider wireless communication almost as optical systems, MDM optical communication systems are further complicated by non-linear effects which will affect the performance and the feasibility of the candidate technique. Therefore, this paper has adequate incentive to investigate the ability of SVD based-MDM of Linear Polarization (LP) vortices in multimode fiber utilizing VCSEL arrays to mitigate the mode coupling and modal dispersion, significantly increasing the bandwidth-distance product. Optical vortices have attracted considerable interest in recent years for their diverse applications in laser trapping [40], supercontinuum generation [41], information processing [42], imaging [43], wavefront sensing [44], and interferometry [45]. This paper models and analyzes for the first time four-group demultiplexing MDM based-SVD. The novel model uses special VCSEL arrays to increase the degrees of freedom for MDM transmission in MMF.
The paper proceeds as follows: the introduction and related works have been presented in Section 1. The methodology and simulation are presented in 2. The mathematical model-based SVD and water-filling algorithm are presented in Section 3, and the results and discussion in Section 4. The conclusion of the paper is given in Section 5.
