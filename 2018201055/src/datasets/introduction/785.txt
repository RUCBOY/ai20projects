There is broad consensus worldwide that students need digital media skills for the future (e.g., European Commission, 2013; Fishman & Dede, 2016; OECD, 2015). However, the results of the 2018 International Computer and Information Literacy Study (ICILS) indicate that in most countries, the majority of students need support using digital media such as computers to complete basic information-gathering and management tasks. Additionally, across the participating countries, 18 percent of students were found to be working below the lowest level of proficiency, indicating a lack of functional working knowledge of computers as tools. In general, results indicate that students are not well prepared for study, work, and life in a digital world (Fraillon, Ainley, Schulz, Friedman, & Duckworth, 2019).
In order to address students' lack of digital media skills, we need to better understand how these skills are shaped. One important prerequisite is digital media self-efficacy. Self-efficacy beliefs are developed through different sources including students' experiences at home and their interactions with their parents (Bandura, 1977). Accordingly, in the present paper we investigate whether parents' beliefs and behaviors at home regarding digital media relate to studentsâ€™ digital media self-efficacy.
