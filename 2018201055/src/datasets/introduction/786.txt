An inhomogeneity of real-world networks manifests as distinct differences of density between intra-edges and inter-edges in certain subgraphs [1]. This is often called the community structure of network. Community detection is useful for similar module identification and node classification, and different communities usually carry out different functions [2]. Traditional methods assume each node only belongs to one community, such as spectral method [1] and Louvain algorithm [3]. However, nodes may have multiple memberships in real-world networks, for example two people could be co-workers and friends. Different from no community overlap, the possibility of multiple memberships for each node makes community detection even harder. The freedom of membership brings a huge explosion of possible solutions. As a result, overlapping community detection has attracted more and more attention in recent years [4], [5].
There are mainly two types of overlapping community detection algorithms. One is based on dense subgraph detection and merges certain overlapping subgraphs into communities [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11]. Besides, local community detection methods based on seed sets also have been developed [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. The other is based on community affiliation model, and non-negative matrix factorization is a standard method, where the latent vectors can be naturally interpreted as membership strengths between pairs of nodes and communities [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]. Most methods only focus on edges but ignore affiliation preferences of edge pairs, though it is a natural intuition that nodes are more likely to connect with nodes in the same community than others. Authors in [20] incorporate implicit preferences into overlapping community detection but pay little attention to interpret the relationship between edge possibility and latent factors.
In this paper, we propose the Bayesian Affiliation Preference based Non-negative Matrix Factorization (BAPNMF) method for overlapping community detection. The contributions of our method are in two aspects. First, We designed an edge preference possibility based on affiliation model which connects node membership with edge possibility and satisfies the totality of preference function. Second, by incorporating Bayesian preference of edges, we formulate the optimization objective which maximizes the likelihood of edge preference for each node to fully utilize non-link information. In order to make our method scalable, we exploit stochastic gradient decent with bootstrap sampling to learn the parameters. We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real-world networks. Compared with several state-of-art approaches, our method not only obtains overlapping community partitions with high quality but is scalable for large-scale data sets.
The structure of the remainder of this paper is as follows. Related works of overlapping community detection are introduced in Section 2. The details of BAPNMF model and stochastic gradient decent optimization algorithm are presented in Section 3. In Section 4, our method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world data sets along with several state-of-art approaches. Finally, it concludes with a discussion and summary in Section 5.
