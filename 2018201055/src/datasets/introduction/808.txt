Semiconductor nanostructures (NSs) have gained much interest due to their unique properties and they are demonstrated to be suitable for many device applications [1,2]. Recently, hybrid quantum dots (QDs) of InAs/GaAs and GaSb/GaAs have been proposed and their PL performance is studied by Huffaker's group [3]. The combination of types I and II QDs gives interesting optical and electrical properties due to high absorption and emission rate of type I QDs [4] and long carrier life time of type II QDs [5,6]. Tuning of the hybrid QD structure to control carrier absorption, diffusion and recombination rates can be conducted leading to improved performance of photonic devices such as infrared detectors [7,8] and intermediate band solar cells [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]]. In the case of photovoltaic devices, a hybrid QD design can improve solar cell performance by altering carrier pathways [17]. The successful demonstration is underlined by the well-controllable growth.
Concerning the investigated material systems, InSb/GaAs and GaSb/GaAs have type II band alignment with their large band offset [3,5,7,18]. Comparing to the well-known type I InAs/GaAs system, type II system provides longer carrier lifetimes which enhance carrier extraction. Due to the small bandgap of antimony (Sb)-based materials, Sb-based type II system has the potential as material system for optoelectronic devices utilized in near- to mid-infrared wavelength region. Therefore, the investigation of growth-related optical and electrical properties of hybrid type II InSb/GaAs and GaSb/GaAs NSs is needed as it is an important way for realizing optoelectronic applications.
We have recently reported the molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growths of self-assembled GaSb/GaAs NS [19] and InSb/GaAs NS [[19], [20], [21]] on GaAs substrates. Poempool et al. have reported the different surface morphologies and photoluminescence emissions of GaSb and InSb NSs at particular growth conditions [19]. Later, Thainoi et al. have revealed the interesting surface morphologies of InSb NS by controlling the various growth parameters [20,21]. From the reported studies, the optimum growth conditions for the targeted surface morphologies of NS can be determined. However, the further investigation of these NSs for the particular nano-electronics and nano-photonics applications has been remained. In the meanwhile, the idea to combine different material systems, which results in interdigitated properties [3,17], has motivated us. Therefore, in this work, type II GaSb/GaAs and InSb/GaAs NSs are consecutively grown on GaAs substrates for the hybrid NSs by MBE. The hybrid InSb and GaSb NSs with varied number of cycles (one, two and four) are inserted in AlGaAs/GaAs double heterostructures. InSb NSs are formed by self-assembly as a result of strain relaxation: the lattice mismatch between InSb and GaAs is 14% [[20], [21], [22]]. GaSb NSs on GaAs having a smaller lattice mismatch of 7.8% can be realized in a similar manner [3,5,8,11,[15], [16], [17], [18], [19],22]. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman scattering spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and current density-voltage (J-V) characterization are performed in order to reveal the properties of hybrid InSb and GaSb NSs. The high density and slightly elongated GaSb and InSb NSs are realized. Raman scattering spectroscopy demonstrates the slight Raman peak shifts resulting from the induced strain effect due to the presence of NS layers. Broad and strong PL signals are detected at 20Â K up to room temperature.
