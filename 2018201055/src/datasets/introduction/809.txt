As technology becomes an indispensable part of human life, efforts for a more natural interaction between human and technological devices are growing rapidly. Since emotions are an important part of human interaction, it is essential to embed emotion recognition capability into human–machine interaction systems. There exists several studies focusing on building emotion recognition systems using information gathered from several information sources such as facial expressions [1], [2], speech [3], [4], [5], [6], and physiological signals [7], [8], [9]. As a primary and natural way of communication, speech contains important information about emotional state of a human. Thus efforts towards building speech emotion recognition (SER) systems are integral to natural human–computer interaction [7], [10].
To build a speech emotion recognition system, many acoustic parameters, such as prosodic and spectral information, have been used to extract a large set of features. However, high dimensional feature space increases the computational cost and the curse of dimensionality. To solve this problem several feature selection methods, which is of considerable importance in bioinformatics, data mining and pattern recognition, are applied to the large feature sets. Sequential forward selection [11], [12], ReliefF [13], correlation based feature selection [14], principal component analysis [15], correlation analysis and fisher criterion [16] and statistical feature selection [17] are among the algorithms used in SER studies.
The purpose of feature selection algorithms is to reduce the number of features by removing irrelevant and redundant ones. However, searching all subset space requires exhaustive search which is computationally intractable and considered as NP-Hard problem [18], [19]. To overcome this problem, metaheuristic search algorithms such as Genetic algorithms [20], [21], [22], Ant-Colony [21], Cuckoo search algorithm [23], particle swarm optimization [24], [25], [26], Grey Wolf optimization [27] and Artificial Bee Colony algorithm [28] have been employed since such algorithms tend to reach global optimum subset while searching feature subspace. Genetic Algorithms (GA) using the natural selection mechanism are the stochastic search techniques [29]. GA can be implemented as single-objective or multi-objective. For instance, Brester et al. [20] proposed a modified multi-objective genetic algorithm to select features for speech emotion recognition. In [24], a method for feature selection that combines particle swarm optimization and Biogeography-based algorithm was proposed for SER. In an other study, Rao et al. proposed a new model that consists of artificial bee colony optimization and gradient boosting decision tree [28]. Recently, Kozodoi et al. used non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) for feature selection [30]. In [22], a modified NSGA-II is proposed to select variables for product quality determination.
Cuckoo Search is also a metaheuristic algorithm that is proposed for continuous optimization [31], [32]. This algorithm combines local and global searches using a switching probability Pa [33]. While local random search is determined by random walk using current solutions, global search is performed by Lévy flight [23]. Solutions are updated as continuous valued points in Cuckoo Search. In order to use Cuckoo Search algorithm for feature selection, Binary Cuckoo Search is proposed [34]. Recently, a modified Cuckoo Search, that uses the rough sets theory, was proposed to produce more general feature subsets [35].
In addition to feature extraction and selection, classification stage also plays an important role in order to build a successful SER system. In most of the SER studies, classifiers such as k-nearest neighbor (kNN) [17], decision trees [36] and SVM [37], [38] are trained using acoustic features. Recently, deep learning approaches have also been used in SER studies for feature extraction and classification [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. For example, in [43], the authors used 1D-2D CNN and LSTM networks to learn local and global emotion-related features from speech. In another study a CNN model with residual block was introduced for SER [39]. Even though, promising results are presented in such studies, since our goal is to evaluate the performance of metaheuristic based feature selection methods in SER, we employed conventional classifiers, namely k-NN, bagged decision trees and SVM with standard speech features.
In recent studies, multi-objective and swarm-intelligent algorithms have been preferred for optimization problems. Among the multi-objective algorithms, NSGA-II is the most popular algorithm due to its pareto front solution selection mechanism [28], [22], [30]. Besides, Cuckoo Search is a relatively new method among swarm-intelligent algorithms. Compared to other metaheuristic methods, Cuckoo Search usually converges to the global best solution by its ability to search different solution spaces by employing Lévy flight [44]. In several studies, Cuckoo Search has also been shown to give promising results for feature selection [34], [23], [45], [35], [46], [47]. Thus, in this paper, we evaluated the performances of Cuckoo Search and NSGA-II metaheuristics search algorithms for feature selection in speech emotion recognition. We also propose an approach to generate initial populations based on relevance weights produced by ReliefF. Thus, more relevant features in emotion classification are more likely to be found in the initial population sets.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Emotional Databases, feature selection methods and proposed models are presented in Section 2. Experimental setups and results are given in Section 3. Section 4 concludes the paper.
