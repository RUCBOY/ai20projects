The chemostat is a basic laboratory instrument for continuous culture of microorganisms. The basic design and theory of continuous culture were originally described independently by [1], [2]. The chemostat consists of three parts, namely, nutrient vessel, culture vessel and collection vessel. In industry, the chemostat can be used to simulate the decomposition of biological wastes, or to evolve water with microorganisms, etc. At the same time, the construction and analysis of chemostat model also play an important role both in mathematical and theoretical ecology. In recent years, many authors have analyzed various deterministic chemostat models and introduced many mathematical methods for analyzing chemostat models, we can see [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17] in detail.
A classical deterministic chemostat model with single microorganism and single nutrient base and general response function can take the following form:(1.1){S′(t)=D(S0−S(t))−1δp(S(t))x(t),x′(t)=−Dx(t)+p(S(t))x(t),where all parameters are positive constants, and S(t), x(t) stand for the concentrations of the nutrient and microorganism at time t respectively; S0 represents the input concentration of the nutrient; D is the common washout rate; δ is a growth yield constant reflecting the conversion of nutrient to organism. The general response function p(S):R+→R+ represents the pre-capita growth rate of the species, it is continuously differentiable, and it satisfiesp(0)=0,p(S)>0forS>0.Thus, 1δp(S) indicates the rate of nutrient uptake by microbial population.
Generally speaking, for chemostat model, we often choose the following functional response functions (or uptake function), which can be found in many literatures.
•Monotone response functions:(1)Lotka-Volterra: p(S)=mS, where m>0 is a constant.(2)Michaelis-Menten (Monod): p(S)=mSa+S, where m>0 represents the maximal growth rate of the microbial species; a>0 is the half-saturation (or Michaelis-Menten) constant.(3)IvIev:p(S)=1−e−λS, where λ>0 is a constant.(4)p(S)=arctanS, which has the same property as Monod type response function.(5)Sigmoidal: p(S)=mS2(a+S)(b+S), where m>0,a>0 and b are constant.•Nonmonotone response function:(1)Monod-Haldane: p(S)=mSa+S+bS2, where m>0, and the term bS2 is an inhibition.
In the chemostat environment, different microorganisms have different sensitivity to nutrient concentration. Generally speaking, the lower nutrient concentration is not enough to maintain the growth of microorganisms, while the higher nutrient concentration will inhibit the growth of microorganisms. Therefore, from this point of view, it seems not appropriate to choose a monotone functional response function, while choosing a nonmonotone functional response function may be more practical. So, in this paper, we will choose Monod-Haldane response function, thus, system (1.1) will become the following form:(1.2){dS(t)dt=D(S0−S(t))−1δmS(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t),dx(t)dt=−Dx(t)+mS(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t),where m>0 is the maximal growth rate; a>0 represents the Michaelies-Menten constant, and the term bS2 is an inhibition, b is a half-saturation parameter. In order to understand the Monod-Haldane response function p(S)=mSa+S+bS2 more clearly, we simply draw an image of p(S), where the parameter values are as follows: m=1,a=1,b=0.5 (see Fig. 1). Because p(S)=mSa+S+bS2 is a nonmonotone function, when p(S)=mSa+S+bS2=D, where D<mSa+S+bS2∣S=ab, there will be two solutions, namely: S=λ and S=μ, and we assume λ<μ (please see Fig. 1 in detail). When S∈(λ,μ), p(S)>D, which means that microorganism can survive; when S∉(λ,μ), p(S)<D, which means that microorganism will be washed out, and microorganism will be extinct.Download : Download high-res image (145KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1.

In the chemostat system, we note that, m>0 is the maximal growth rate of microorganism x. However, in the real environment of continuous microbial culture, due to the continuous disturbance of environmental noise, the maximal growth rate m always oscillates near an average value m¯. In order to simulate the impact of random environmental noise on the maximal growth rate m, we can take two ways [18]: The first way to interfere with m is a linear function of Gaussian white noise, as follows:(1.3)m(t)=m¯+σdB(t)dt,where m¯ is the long-time mean level of the maximal growth rate m(t), and it is a positive constant; B(t) is a standard Wiener process, σ represents the intensity of environmental noise.
By integrating (1.3) directly, we can get the average washout rate over an interval [0,t], namely(1.4)1t∫0tm(s)ds=m¯+σB(t)t∼N(m¯,σ2t).
From (1.4), we can see that the average washout rate over an interval of length t has a variance σ2t, which will go to infinity as t→0. Naturally, we will think of a question: as the time interval t decreases, the average value of the maximal growth rate m in a limited time will become more and more variable. Is this reasonable?
The second way to interfere with m is classical mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process [19], we have(1.5)dm(t)=α(m¯−m(t))dt+βdB(t),where α,β are all positive constants, and α represents the speed of reversion; β is the intensity of volatility; m¯ is the mean reversion level of m. In the theory of financial economics, Dixit and Pindyck first studied the mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in [20], which is also called Dixit and Pindyck model.
According to [21], we can get the following explicit form solution from (1.5):(1.6)m(t)=m¯+(m0−m¯)e−αt+β∫0te−α(t−s)dB(s),where m(0)=m0.
Through simple calculation, we can find that the expected value and the variance of m(t) over an interval [0,t] is(1.7)E(m(t))=m¯+(m0−m¯)e−αt,and(1.8)Var(m(t))=β22α(1−e−2αt).Thus, we can see that E(m(t))→m0 and Var(m(t))→0 when t→0. Compared with the first case, that is m(t) is a linear function of Gaussian white noise, the variance of the second case will go to 0 rather than ∞ as t→0, which seems to fit the biological hypothesis. Therefore, this is an effective and reasonable method to introduce environmental noise into chemostat model.
Based on the discussion above, in this paper, we will construct and analyze a stochastic chemostat model with mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and Monod-Haldane response function, and we assume that the maximal growth rate m will be affected by random environmental noise.
From (1.5)–(1.8), we can easy to know that the term β∫0te−α(t−s)dB(s) follows the normal distribution N(0,β22α(1−e−2αt)). Therefore, it is equivalent to(1.9)β∫0te−α(t−s)dB(s)=β2α1−e−2αtdB(t)dta.s.
Thus, (1.6) can be almost surely rewritten as follows:(1.10)m(t)=m¯+(m0−m¯)e−αt+β2α1−e−2αtdB(t)dt.
Combining system (1.2) with (1.5) together, we can get the following system(1.11){dS(t)=[D(S0−S(t))−1δm(t)S(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)]dt,dx(t)=[−Dx(t)+m(t)S(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)]dt,dm(t)=α(m¯−m(t))dt+βdB(t).
Substituting (1.10) into system (1.11), we can get the following stochastic non-autonomous chemostat model(1.12){dS(t)=[D(S0−S(t))−1δm¯S(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)−1δ(m0−m¯)e−αtS(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)]dt−βδ2α1−e−2αtS(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)dB(t),dx(t)=[−Dx(t)+m¯S(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)+(m0−m¯)e−αtS(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)]dt+βδ2α1−e−2αtS(t)x(t)a+S(t)+bS2(t)dB(t).
According to stochastic model (1.12), and we let ρ(t)=δS(t)+x(t), by simple calculation, we have(1.13)dρ(t)=d(δS(t)+x(t))=δdS(t)+dx(t)=[δD(S0−S(t))−Dx(t)]dt=[δDS0−Dρ(t)]dt.Thus, we have(1.14)ρ(t)=δS(t)+x(t)=δS0(1−e−Dt)+ρ0e−Dt≤δS0+ρ0:=Θ,where ρ0=δS(0)+x(0), and we can obtain that(1.15)limt→∞ρ(t)=δS0.
So far, many authors have studied the dynamic behavior of the chemostat model under the influence of white noise, such as [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37]. For example, in [22], Zhao and Yuan mainly focused on studying the noise-induced bifurcation in the stochastic chemostat model with general nutrient uptake functions, they used the noise intensity as a bifurcation parameter, it is proved that the model undergoes a dynamical (D) bifurcation and a phenomenological (P) bifurcation. In [23], Zhang and Yuan considered a stochastic chemostat model with non-zero cost inhibiting in finite time. The near-optimal control problem was constructed by minimizing the number of harmful microorganisms and minimizing the cost of inhibitor. In [24], Yan ahd Sun investigated a stochastic chemostat model with variable yield. The environment noises were given by independent standard Brownian motions, and the yield coefficient reflected the conversion of nutrient to microorganism varies depending on the ambient nutrient. In [25], Gao and Jiang considered two chemostat models with random perturbation, in which single species depended on two perfectly substitutable resources for growth. In [26], Sun et.al studied a stochastic two-species Monod-type competition chemostat model which is subject to environment noises. Such noises were described by independent standard Brownian motions.
In all the above articles, the author mainly studied the chemostat model under the influence of white noise. However, few people studied the chemostat model under the influence of color noise. Therefore, system (1.12) will be a new breakthrough in the dynamical behavior of stochastic chemostat model. We try our best to study the solution characteristics of this model and explore the conditions of extinction and persistence for microorganism.
Thus, this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we will prove the existence and uniqueness of global positive solutions of system (1.12) for any initial value. In Section 3, sufficient conditions for the extinction exponentially of microorganism are given. In Section 4, we study persistence in the mean of microorganism for stochastic model (1.12). In Section 5, some numerical simulations and conclusions are given.
