Diabetic foot is an infection, ulcer, or injury of the deep soft tissue occurred by neurological abnormalities and various degrees of the peripheral vascular abnormalities in the lower limbs [1,2]. It is the most common long-term and most costly complication of diabetes [[3], [4], [5]] and can lead to infection, gangrene, amputation, or even death [6]. Peripheral neuropathy, as the first phase of diabetic foot, is developed if it is not diagnosed immediately, and leads to increased risk of amputation up to 15 % [7]. Diabetic patients with neuropathic feet lack the sensory feedback, indicating that the patterns of walking, resting, and their shoes should be changed to heal or prevent diabetic foot [8].
Many external factors related to feet and shoes such as foot pressure, foot movement in the shoes, shoelace, moisture penetration, insole geometry, shoes depth and stiffness can develop diabetic ulcers. Each of these external factors requires patients’ data to be monitored [[9], [10], [11]]. Consequently, daily and simultaneously measurement and monitoring these parameters in the shoes can be useful to prevent diabetic foot [12]. Furthermore, excessive irritation and friction between the skin and socks or shoes increases the risk of infection and ulcer. Increased temperature caused by excessive friction also increases the blisters which in turn increases the infection risk because of high temperature and moisture [8,13]. High foot temperature is one of the main reasons for foot ulcers [14]. Studies have shown that there is a direct relationship between temperature of the feet and increased risk for diabetic foot [16, 15]. Furthermore, excessive moisture will lead to severe damage to feet and is very harmful for diabetic patients. Wetness or excessive moisture destroys tissues, spreads the infection to the surrounding tissues, increases the number of wounds, prevents wounds from healing, and results in deep wounds. These deep wounds may penetrate the tendons, muscles, or bones [17].
To prevent ulceration on patients’ feet, the parameters resulting in the ulcer should be monitored, and managed [18]. The best way to measure and manage the various parameters such as pressure, temperature, and moisture is to use non-invasive monitoring tools [19]. Sensors are one of the main non-invasive monitoring tools used to collect the physiological and motor data and enable patients to monitor themselves [20]. Sensors transfer the collected data to smart phones, computers or other wireless devices in real time, and they will help patients in pursuing and evaluating the physiological data and self-management [21]. Smart wearable devices can be used as diagnostic tools to identify and manage the various diseases, using sensors [22].
Many researchers have developed smart shoes for diabetic patients. Some of these studies have shown that continuous monitoring of some of these parameters can reduce the recurrence of diabetic foot ulcers [23]. However, most of these studies have not considered three destructive parameters of pressure, moisture (sweat), and temperature in developing the monitoring systems for diabetic foot [[24], [25], [26]]. Therefore, based on the high rates of amputation and mortality caused by diabetic foot, we aimed to develop a smart shoes device and a smart phone application to monitor the parameters affecting the foot ulcer development in order to empower diabetic patients for self-management.
