The theory of rough sets [23] is an effective tool for handling vague, uncertain, or imprecise data. Since the pioneering work of Pawlak [22], several extended and generalized models have been proposed, such as neighbourhood rough sets [10], [45], covering rough sets [15], [42], fuzzy rough sets [4], [6], probabilistic rough sets [31], [32], and others [46]. Among them, three-way decision [30], proposed by Yao [33], [41], is one of the most popular and efficient models for decision-making. Despite originating from probabilistic rough sets [33], the research and development of three-way decision have gone beyond the realm of rough sets and become the methodology and philosophy for thinking in threes [35], [36], [38], [40], [47]. Due to the universality and effectiveness, three-way decision has been introduced to many research domains, such as attribute reduction [43], conflict analysis [37], formal concept analysis [39], etc. Decision-theoretic rough sets (referred to as DTRS hereafter) [42], as a representative paradigm of three-way decision, generalizes the Pawlak rough sets by introducing the theory of Bayesian risk decision. In DTRS, binary decisions with options “yes” and “no” are extended into triple decisions, i.e., “yes”, “no”, and “wait-to-see”. Moreover, DTRS provides a unified and comprehensive framework for rough sets and exhibits the salient characteristics and advantages in probabilistic reasoning and semantic interpretation [34].
Both DTRS and other extensions of rough sets are primarily used to handle either labeled data or unlabeled data. However, in many real-world applications, such as web-page categorization, image retrieval, and intrusion detection [50], we often confront the case where labeled data are scarce since hand-labeled objects are fairly expensive to obtain, whereas unlabeled data are relatively cheap and readily available. In this scenario, traditional supervised learning may yield undesirable results because of the scarcity of labeled data, while unsupervised learning using only unlabeled data will result in the waste of valuable label information. Intuitively, a promising way is to fully capitalize on both labeled and unlabeled data to train an effective learning model [48], [50].
For the data containing both labeled and unlabeled data (referred to as partially labeled data hereafter), Lingras [14] et al. extended DTRS from two classes to multiple classes and introduced semi-supervised costs for promotional campaigns in real-world retail stores. Miao et al. [18] developed a semi-supervised discernibility matrix and proposed a diverse semi-supervised reducts-based model for partially labeled data. Dai et al. [5] employed the consistent rate of objects as the fitness function to generate semi-supervised reduct. Based on the concept of discernibility, Dai et al. [7] further developed two attribute reduction measures for partially labeled data. Instead of equivalence relation, fuzzy or neighbourhood relations-based rough set models are also introduced to deal with partially labeled data. Parthalain and Jensen [21] employed the unlabeled objects contained in the fuzzy lower approximation of all decision classes to retrain the model iteratively and presented a fuzzy rough set-based self-training model for partially labeled data. Wang et al. [29] used Gaussian kernel-based fuzzy rough set to measure the inconsistency of unlabeled objects and proposed a SVM-based sample selection algorithm for active learning. Jensen et al. [11] presented a semi-supervised fuzzy rough attribute reduction method, in which the fuzzy dependency degree on both labeled and unlabeled data was used to measure the quality of attribute subsets. To deal with numerical data, Liu et al. [16] introduced a weighted neighbourhood approximate quality and neighbourhood granules for partially labeled data. Further, they [17] used a graph-based semi-supervised method to yield the pseudo labels of all unlabeled data, and local neighbourhood decision error rates under different decision classes were combined to measure the significance of attributes. Li et al. [13] provided a semi-supervised attribute reduction method for partially labeled data with numerical attributes, where conditional neighbourhood granulation and neighbourhood granulation were used to measure the significance of attributes on labeled data and unlabeled data, respectively. By integrating cost-sensitive learning and three-way theory, Min et al. [19] proposed an active learning algorithm for classification. Qian et al. [24], [25] presented several local rough set models for big data with limited labels and provided some efficient local attribute reduct algorithms based on local lower approximation. In addition, the theory of rough sets has also been successfully applied to practical problems with partially labeled data [12], [26].
The aforementioned works mainly concentrate on rough sets-based semi-supervised attribute reduction or practical applications. Little attention has been paid for the semi-supervised rough set model to learn directly from both labeled and unlabeled data. On the one hand, the utilization of unlabeled data is a key problem of semi-supervised learning model, and unlabeled data may contain noisy or useless objects, which have a negative effect on the learning model. To guarantee the performance of semi-supervised learning model, it is vital and necessary to develop an appropriate and effective mechanism to select useful unlabeled objects. On the other hand, decision-making under uncertainty often results in different costs or risks. The selection of unlabeled objects should take into consideration the cost or risk of decision. Motivated by the above facts, we propose a three-way decision-based semi-supervised model for partially labeled data. The main contribution of this paper is threefold.
(1)To address the problem of attribute reduction for partially labeled data, we develop the concept of confidence discernibility matrix, based on which a heuristic algorithm is designed to yield the optimal reduct of partially labeled data. The confidence discernibility matrix takes into consideration both labeled and unlabeled data and allows a certain degree of inconsistency, thus resulting in better adaptability and robustness for partially labeled data. In addition, we prove several propositions about the confidence discernibility matrix, which provide the theoretical basis for semi-supervised attribute reduction.(2)To exploit unlabeled data efficiently, we design a three-way co-decision model for partially labeled data. The unlabeled objects to use have a considerable effect on the performance of the learning mode. Three way-decision is an effective method for decision making under uncertainty and risk. We thus introduce the theory of three-way decision to conduct the selection of useful unlabeled data. Moreover, motivated by the idea of co-training [2], the collaborative decision framework using two distinct semi-supervised reducts is adopted, which could make the classifiers of the model learn from each other. By incorporating the theory of three-way decision with the mechanism of co-training, the co-decision model could make full use of unlabeled data to improve its performance.(3)To gain a deep insight into the proposed model, we theoretically analyze the model from the perspective of noise learning and give the upper bound on the number of exploitable unlabeled data. Additionally, extensive experiments are performed to test the effectiveness of the proposed model, and promising results are achieved, indicating the potential of the proposed model for partially labeled data.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents some concepts in semi-supervised learning and three-way decision, respectively. Section 3 describes the proposed co-decision model for partially labeled data, and its effectiveness is also theoretically analyzed. Experimental results and analysis are shown in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and indicates future research work.
