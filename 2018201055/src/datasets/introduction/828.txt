Honey is a natural product collected by honey bees from the flowers of flowering plants. As an ancient food, honey has high nutritional value and good human health benefits; for example, it has antimicrobial, anticarcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antioxidant effects [1]. The quality and composition of honey mainly depend on the botanical source of the nectar used by bees during production [2]. The misrepresentation of honey’s floral origin will cause serious economic losses for honey consumers and producers [3]. Therefore, honey botanical origin authentication plays an important role in quality control of the honey industry. In addition, the need to determine the different botanical origins of honey also comes from the increase in the demand for honey certification on the market. The European Union has accepted a proposal that the blossom or plant origin of commercial honey must be supplied by the producer with its products [4].
The challenge of this task comes from the complex constituents and their interactions present in the honey samples. The chemical compounds of honey include multiple carbohydrates, organic acids, inorganic acids, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, enzymes and aroma compounds. Currently, a widely used method to confirm honey botanical origin is melissopalynological analysis, which determines the botanical origin of honey by analyzing its pollen species. However, this method is time consuming and requires professional inspectors for visual identification [5]. Alternative methods include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [6], gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) [7], phenolic compound physicochemical analysis [8], [9], Raman spectroscopy [10], physical–chemical analysis [11], hyperspectral imaging [12] and near-infrared spectroscopy [13]. However, the detection processes of these methods are complicated, require bulky and expensive equipment and are not suitable for rapid or on-site measurements.
Electronic tongue is a kind of bionic detection technology inspired by the mode of taste perception of humans. As a convenient and nondestructive testing technology, electronic tongue systems have been widely used to detect different analytes, such as determining adulteration of virgin olive oil [14], analyzing the total theaflavin content in black tea [15], analyzing coffee adulterations [16], monitoring water quality [17], identifying the geographical origins of rice wines [18] and identifying the botanic origin of the honey [19], [20]. Currently, various types of electronic tongues have been developed based on different working principles (e.g., potentiometry [21], [22], voltammetry [23], [24], impedance spectroscopy [25], and optics [26]). Among them, voltammetric electronic tongue (V-ET) systems have received extensive attention due to their high sensitivity, fast detection speed, good signal-to-noise ratio and flexible application [27], [28], [29]. Traditional V-ET systems are mainly based on multiple electrode arrays and computer-controlled measurement systems, which are bulky, expensive and inflexible. Recently, developments in wireless Internet and embedded techniques permit data to be collected online and transmitted in real time by miniaturized and cost-effective apparatuses, which greatly improve the flexibility and mobility of such detection systems. Nevertheless, very few reports on developing and applying a remote electronic tongue system can be found in the literature.
In the detection process, a large number of complicated signals are collected by the V-ET system. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a preprocessing stage for extracting the most relevant information from the original signal to overcome the difficulties of analyzing the raw data. In many cases, depending on personal experience, coefficients such as the minimum value, maximum value, maximum slope, inflection values and total area of the voltammogram are randomly collected as feature values to represent the original signal [30], [31], [32], [3]. However, these methods might lose some potentially sophisticated information for characterizing the signals. Another alternative approach is based on a spatial data transform, such as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) [33] and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) [34]. Nevertheless, these approaches are limited due to their inherent problems; for instance, FFT is unsuitable for compressing nonstationary signals [35], DWT cannot adaptively select the appropriate the wavelet basis function [36]. Recently, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) has gained reputation as a method for analyzing nonlinear and nonstationary time series data [37]. HHT consists of two processes: empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Hilbert transform (HT), among which EMD method has been well applied in single-channel source separation [38], speech emotion recognition [39] and fault diagnosis [40]. However, in practice, EMD exhibits the end effect and mode-mixing phenomenon [41], which affects the accuracy of signal analysis. Therefore, a new feature extraction method, which has a good capability in variable reduction and data representation for the V-ET system, needs to be further investigated.
In this work, a novel remote V-ET system is designed and constructed, which consists of a sensor array, a handheld instrument, a GPRS network, and a remote server. For the first time, a new signal feature extraction method for V-ET systems is proposed by combining variational mode decomposition and Hilbert transformation (VMD-HT). Based on the extracted feature datasets, two kinds of classification algorithms, namely, principal component analysis (PCA) and extreme learning machine (ELM), were applied to classify the honey samples. By combining a remote V-ET system and the proposed pattern recognition method, a fast, portable and cost-effective method for honey botanical origin authentication is established.
