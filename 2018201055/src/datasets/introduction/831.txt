Recently, due to the emerging services such as 4 K/8K large video application, 5G internet of things, and cloud computing, the capacity demand for access network is exploding. However, due to insufficient frequency resources, current 4G data rates for wireless communications are limited and can only support a few hundred Mbps. Therefore, to meet enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and provide multi-Gbps resources, the millimeter wave in W-band is an excellent solution [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. However, to provide higher data rate, the limited bandwidth for the electronic devices becomes a bottleneck to further enhance the system capacity. To overcome this issue and produce multi-Gbps signals, the generation technology of photonics-assisted mm-wave has been investigated [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. Moreover, OFDM as multi-carrier signals are favored by multi-user access network due to independent subcarrier optimization and higher spectral efficiency.
Probabilistic shaping (PS) can improve system capacity and signal quality due to additional shaping gain by transmitting signals with non-uniform distributions. Moreover, PS can release the requirement of the order of QAM and the baud rate of signals for the system. Some paper has reported the application of PS in W-band radio-over-fiber (RoF) system. In [3], by employing PS and orthogonal circulant matrix transform precoding, net data rates of 1.81 Gb/s 64-QAM OFDM signals can reach BER of 1 × 10−4. In our previous work [1], by employing PS, the BER can be improved from 3.4 × 10−2 to 1.02 × 10−2 when 7 Gbaud 64-QAM OFDM signals are transmitted in 1-m wireless and 22 km SSMF. In this case, we further improve BER performance by adopting pre-equalization (PE) to compensate high frequency attenuation.
In this paper, a photonic-aided fiber and MM-wave converged system is experimentally demonstrated in W-band. And this is the first time that PS and PE are applied in this system. By adopting above method, the BER can be improved from 1.65 × 10−2 to 4.4 × 10−3 when 8 Gbaud 16-QAM OFDM signal are transmited in 4-m wireless and 25 km SSMF.
