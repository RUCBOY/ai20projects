Since the past decades, studies in aerospace, automotive and marine structures have been constantly seeking answers to the question of how one can produce composite materials that have higher strength and stiffness but require less weight and cost. Until recently, in traditional composite structures, these targets were tried to be achieved by uniform lamination (straight and unidirectional fibers) over the whole structure (Constant Stiffness Composite Laminates-CSCL), and it was focused on increasing the number and thickness of the layers or changing the uniform fiber angle in the layer. However, due to their low transverse shear modulus, laminated composites can exhibit significant transverse shear deformation than the isotropic counterparts and thus, when designing composite structures, it is also important to obtain the accurate strain and stress fields through the thickness in order to prevent delamination caused by the transverse shear deformations.
Within the context of composite modelling, the theories for the stress–strain analysis of laminated composites can be grouped into two: Layerwise (LW) and Equivalent Single Layer (ESL) theories. In the LW theory [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], the thickness coordinate is split into a number of analysis layers and the kinematic displacement fields of each analysis layer have been independently described which makes the theory computationally expensive and dependent on the number of layers considered. The ESL theories [7], [8], [9], [10], [11] treat a heterogeneous laminated plate as a statically equivalent, single layer having a complex constitutive behavior, thereby reducing the 3-D continuum problem into 2-D space.
Refined Zigzag Theory (RZT), developed by Tessler et al. [12], [13], [14], [15], can be counted as one of the ESL theories which accounts for the zigzag pattern of the axial displacements by introducing a zigzag function for each layer. The kinematic variables of the theory are independent from the number of layers which make RZT computationally more efficient. In addition, anomalies for the clamped supports, encountered in the zigzag theory of Averill et al. [16], [17], [18] has been corrected in the RZT. Moreover, Gherlone [19] has compared the performances of RZT with Murakami’s one [11] and concluded that zigzag functions of RZT lead to more accurate results, especially for arbitrary stacking sequences, and superior even for the case where the external layers of a laminate are weaker than the adjacent layers. Iurlaro et al. [20] have investigated the efficiency of RZT in predicting the static response, natural frequencies and bucking loads of sandwich plates. Barut et al. [21] have proposed a new C0-continuous triangular plate element based on RZT that considers the transverse normal strain for laminated composite and sandwich plates. The isogeometric static analysis of straight fiber laminated beams and plates using RZT have recently been introduced [22], [23], [24]. By using anisoparametric interpolation strategy, Versino et al. [25] have developed a six and three node, C0-continuous, RZT based triangular plate/shell elements. Ascione and Gherlone [26] have developed a nonlinear formulation of RZT using Von-Karman strain–displacement relations. These studies overall focus on the structural mechanics of composites and sandwich structures with straight fibers.
Later on, the aforementioned studies for the straight fiber laminates were followed by the studies on the Variable Stiffness Composite Laminates (VSCL). The VSCL is based on the idea of changing the lamina stiffness locally which can be enforced by either changing the fiber volume ratio [27] or terminating the inner layers (ply drop-off) to reduce the composite thickness in certain regions [28]. However, the last option can result in highly stress-concentrated regions. With the invention of automated fiber replacement machines, the fibers are not constrained along a straight path, anymore and the concept of variable angle tow composites (VAT) along a curvilinear path enable a further characteristic tailor and improve the structural performance and enhanced capability of laminated composite structures by changing stiffness in the desired areas. Vibrational resonance in aerospace and naval structures can be avoided by designing the laminated plates according to maximum fundamental frequency. Abdalla et al. [29] have shown that the utilization of curvilinear fibers enable laminated composites to attain a higher natural frequency thereby eliminating the potential occurrence of vibrational resonance as compared to the straight fiber composites. Hyer and Lee [30] have explored the benefits of using curvilinear fibers to increase the buckling performance. It was shown that curvilinear fibers of a simply supported plate with a centrally located hole divert the load from the unsupported hole region to the supported edges, thus increasing the buckling capacity. When it is necessary to leave holes or notches in the laminated composite plate, it is clear that these gaps disrupt the continuity of the fiber and adversely affect the load carrying capacity in case of using straight fibers. For this reason, many researchers [31], [32] have examined how much the load carrying capacity can be increased by laying curvilinear fibers on the principal tensile and compressive trajectories that appear in accordance with the gap in their experiments. Thus, the load transfer can be carried over the curvilinear fibers instead of resin. Various studies have been conducted to facilitate the placement of curvilinear tows from the manufacturing point of view [33], [34], [35]. In addition, the optimization of variable stiffness composites by maximizing its mechanical strength have been studied in a great detail to determine optimal fiber angles throughout the composite structure. Also, these optimization studies aim to satisfy volume/mass and manufacturing (fiber path continuity) constraints [29], [36], [37], [38], [39] for lean production.
For the structural analysis of curvilinear fiber laminated composites, various numerical methods such as finite element, boundary element, smoothed finite element, mesh-free, differential quadrature etc. [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47] can be applied in the case of insufficient analytical solutions. Among these numerical approaches, finite element method (FEM) is a well-known one and frequently used in computer aided engineering industry (CAE). The FEM mainly utilizes Lagrangian (C0 inter-element continuity) or Hermitian (C1 inter-element continuity) type approximation functions to discretize the unknown kinematic variables of the finite element. However, high degree polynomials used in Lagrangian elements can be unstable and insufficient for the exact definition of complex geometries. In addition, the computer-aided design (CAD) and manufacturing (CAM) industries utilize Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) [48] instead of the former functions to parametrize the geometry, thereby introducing an engineering gap between the two industries, i.e., CAD and CAE.
Fortunately, Hughes et al. [49] introduced a state-of-the-art methodology known as Isogeometric Analysis (IGA), which use the same NURBS basis functions to discretize the geometry and displacement fields. In this regard, requirements for a smoother design geometry, highly precise analysis, and CAD/CAE integrity can be fulfilled without any difficulty. The mathematical backgrounds of NURBS and IGA can be found in the fundamental books of Piegl and Tiller [48] and Cottrell et al. [50], respectively. Albeit to a large collection of IGA studies on composite structures, we only focus on recently published studies for conciseness. For instance, Liu and Jeffers [51] have developed an isogeometric layerwise model for the analysis of straight fiber laminated composite and sandwich plates embedding a functionally graded material core. Thai et al. [52] have developed a generalized shear deformation theory based on IGA by imposing inverse trigonometric functions for the in-plane displacements of the functionally graded isotropic and sandwich plates. Besides, Nguyen et al. [53] have proposed a formulation based on IGA and FSDT for postbuckling analysis of functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite shells. More recently, Shi et al. [54] have introduced a new hyperbolic tangent higher order shear deformation theory assessed with the NURBS based IGA for the static, free vibration and buckling analysis of laminated composite plates. Nguyen et al. [55] have proposed a novel, generalized three-variable shear deformation plate theory by using the high-order continuity advantage of IGA. Recently, Nguyen et al. [56] have studied on the analysis of free vibration, buckling and instability of functionally graded porous plates, reinforced by graphene platelets using three-variable shear deformation theory. Furthermore, Fantuzzi and Tornabene [57] have employed strong form finite elements with isogeometric mapping for arbitrarily shaped laminated composite plates. With the development of micro electromechanical systems, recent studies are dedicated to investigating the small-scale effects for the bending, buckling and thermal analyses of layered composite microplates utilizing isogeometric analysis [58], [59].
Most of the IGA studies regarding composite structures are mainly dedicated to the structural analysis of straight fiber laminated beams/plates/shells. To the best of authors’ knowledge, there is currently no study available in literature concerning IGA of laminated plates with curvilinear paths that provides a rigorous mathematical formulation based on RZT. In this study, we propose a novel structural analysis methodology based on the coupling of isogeometric framework and RZT for accurately modelling VAT composite and sandwich structures. We envisage that the present IG-RZT formulation can address the shortcomings of finite element-based techniques available in literature, especially in the case of predicting accurate through-the-thickness distributions of stresses and strains with less computational cost.
This study is organized as follows. In the first part of IG-RZT mathematical formulation, the original form of RZT displacement fields is extended into higher order thickness expansions. In Section 3, the foundations of NURBS functions and IGA are briefly discussed. On the basis of these formulations, we provide the coupling of IGA and RZT for VAT composite structures in Section 4. In Section 5, numerical results are obtained for the bending of square and circular laminated composite plates and sandwich structures with curvilinear paths. The results are compared with high-fidelity 3-D ANSYS models and other reference solutions taken from the literature. The final section is devoted to the main conclusions that may be drawn from the present numerical results.
