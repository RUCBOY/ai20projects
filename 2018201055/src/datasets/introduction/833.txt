Portland cement (PC) concrete is the most produced-and-used material for the construction of infrastructure. However, the production of PC – currently at ≈ 4 B tons/year, and growing rapidly at the rate of ≈80 M tons/year [1] – presents considerable energy consumption (≈11 EJ/year [2]) and environmental impact (≈9% of global CO2 emissions [3]) related challenges. Another challenging aspect of PC concrete infrastructure is its susceptibility to degradation (e.g., corrosion of steel-rebar), which could lead to exorbitant costs of repair/re-construction [4], and, in most ill-fated circumstances, culminate with loss of human lives [5]. There is, thus, burgeoning interest in developing binders that are more sustainable, and yet more durable, than PC binders.
Alkali-activated concrete (AAC) – also called geopolymer concrete – is a promising, sustainable alternative to PC concrete [6,7]. The cementing constituent of AAC (i.e., alkali-activated binder) is prepared by mixing amorphous aluminosilicate materials – such as calcined clays (e.g., metakaolin); or industrial byproducts (e.g., fly ash; and blast furnace slag) – with an alkaline activation solution (often referred to as activator) [8]. Typical activation solutions used for formulation of AAC are aqueous solutions of alkali hydroxides (i.e., NaOH; and KOH) and alkali silicates (i.e., Na2SiO3; and K2SiO3) [1,9,10]. These highly soluble alkali compounds, when mixed with water, dissolve rapidly and raise the pH of the resultant activation solution. At high pH, the elevated presence of hydroxyl (OH−) and alkali (Na+/K+) ions in the activation solution facilitates dissolution of the solid aluminosilicate precursor (e.g., fly ash; and slag), resulting in the release of aluminate (Al(OH)4-) and silicate (H2SiO42−/H3SiO4−) ions into the solution [9]. Following this, the formation of reaction product occurs via the following sequence of steps: (i) precipitation of aluminosilicate (Al-Si) monomers and oligomers; (ii) hydrolysis and polycondensation of Al-Si oligomers to form a gel network [[11], [12], [13]]; (iii) reorganization of the gel and release of water; and (iv) polymerization of the gel, which enhances its binding properties [1,10,13]. The final reaction product (geopolymer: N-A-S-H and/or C-(N)-A-S-H gels) comprises of [AlO4]5- and [SiO4]4- tetrahedra linked by oxygen bridges; the alkali cations are incorporated between successive tetrahedra ensuring valence compensation [[10], [11], [12], [13]] [[10], [11], [12], [13]] [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Ca-rich and Ca-deficient AAC precursors (e.g., fly ashes) result, predominantly, in the formation of C-(N)-A-S-H [including C-(N)0-A-S-H that forms in high-Ca systems [8,10,14] and N-A-S-H gels, respectively.
Past studies [9,12,13,15] have shown that – compared to PC concrete – AAC can produce lower CO2-footprint, higher compressive strength, lower permeability, higher thermal and dimensional stability, and better corrosion-resistance. However, to formulate such performance-optimized AAC, it is important to carefully optimize the composition of its precursors (i.e., aluminosilicate composition; and activator) and mixture design (e.g., liquid-to-solid mass ratio; mixing procedure; and curing temperature). This is because the properties of AACs exhibit significant disparities in relation to precursory chemistry and mixture design [[16], [17], [18]].
Among the predominantly-amorphous, aluminosilicate materials that can be used to formulate AAC, fly ash is the prevalent choice because of its widespread availability and abundance [19,20]. Notwithstanding, fly ash, as a function of lineage of its parent coal and its combustion, features substantial diversity in composition. Based on ASTM C618-15 [21], fly ash can be classified into two classes: class C (calcium-rich) and class F (calcium-deficient). Significant research [[22], [23], [24], [25]] has been devoted to developing correlations between composition of precursors (i.e., amounts of Na2O/K2O; CaO; SiO2; Al2O3; and H2O) and properties (e.g., compressive strength) of AACs; success, however, has been inconsistent. This lack of success can be attributed to the overwhelmingly large compositional degrees of freedom – emerging from significant heterogeneity in fly ashes (in terms of their chemical composition, crystallinity and particle size) and activators (in terms of their chemistries) – which, essentially, have disallowed the advancement of clear, (semi-)empirical rules that govern the fundamental linkage between composition and properties of AACs [7,17]. As such, reliable prediction of composition-dependent properties of AACs, based on Edisonian approaches (i.e., iterative and parametric synthesis-testing-analysis cycles [16,18,26]) or conventional theory-based models, has remained infeasible.
Supervised machine learning (ML) – a tributary of artificial intelligence – is a promising approach, with the potential to overcome the limitations of the Edisonian approach. This is because ML is data-driven, and, therefore, capable of predicting composition-dependent properties of heterogeneous materials (such as AAC), even (and especially) in the absence of an across-the-board theoretical understanding. Not surprisingly, in the past decade or so, ML models have been extensively applied to predict various compliance-relevant properties of traditional PC concretes [[27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]]. In the context of AACs, prior studies – albeit very few compared to PC concretes – have also employed ML models to predict compressive strength; selected examples are highlighted here. Dao et al. [26,34] applied artificial neural network, adaptive neuro fuzzy inference, particle swarm optimization-based adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system, and genetic algorithm-based adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system to predict compressive strength of AAC in relation to four compositional descriptors (i.e., fly ash content; Na2SiO3 content; NaOH content; and water content). Lahoti et al. [35] employed random forest (RF), Naïve Bayes, and k-nearest neighbor models to predict 7-day compressive strength of AAC; the ML models were trained using a small database comprising of 71 unique data-records. Nguyen et al. [36] used two different deep ML models to predict compressive strength of AACs using 8 inputs consisting of compositional descriptors of the precursors and curing conditions. Prem et al. [37] used several ML models – all premised on nonlinear regression – to predict compressive strength AACs in relation to their compositions and mixture designs.
Prior literature referenced above shows that regression-based ML models are able to predict compressive strength of AAC with reasonable accuracy. Notwithstanding, in these studies, prediction performances of the ML models were arguably not tested exhaustively. This is because databases used to train and test the models had limited volume and limited diversity (i.e., small number of inputs, which entails that variations in fly ash compositions and mixture design were limited). Furthermore, prior studies have focused exclusively on compressive strength, and not attempted to predict slump flow – a quantitative measurement of workability, and an important compliance-relevant property – of AACs using ML models. Lastly, in prior studies, the AAC mixing procedure (i.e., protocols used for mixing AAC components, followed by curing) was not varied; therefore, the prediction performance of ML models in relation to mixing procedure is unknown. Such evaluation is important because mixing procedure – akin to precursor composition – imparts significant influences on properties of AACs [[38], [39], [40]]. As an example, minor alterations in the procedure and duration of mixing could substantially alter fresh- (e.g., rheology) and hardened-state (e.g., compressive strength) properties of AAC [41,42]. Palacios and Puerta [41] showed that increasing the mixing time – from a few minutes to several minutes – results in increment of initial and final setting times, workability, compressive strength, and flexural strength of slag-based AAC. Another study [42] also showed that increasing the mixing time from 1 to 10 min resulted in prolongation of time before the initial and final setting of AACs formulated using class C fly ash. Mixing energy – an important component of the mixing procedure, which is directly proportional to the speed of mixing (measured as revolutions-per-minute, or rpm) – when increased, has been shown to result in enhancement of compressive strength of AACs formulated using class C fly ash [1]. As ML models – in particular those based nonlinear regression – have been shown to reliably predict mechanical properties of cementitious materials [27,28,43], it is imperative to evaluate if they would be able to accurately predict fresh-state properties and mechanical performance of AACs, in which composition-properties links are presumably more complex than traditional PC concretes. It is also important to evaluate if nonlinear ML models, that are able to produce predictions with sufficient accuracy, are also able to capitalize on the composition-properties links to distinguish the influential compositional (input) parameters from the inconsequential ones [44]. This is important because several commonly-used ML models, such as artificial neural network and support vector machine, function like a “black-boxes” [44], from which it is difficult – if not impossible – to construe or leverage the underlying cause-effect correlations.
The study employs a classification-and-regression trees based random forest (RF) model to predict composition-dependent slump flow and compressive strength of AACs. The model is trained using a high-volume database, consisting of >200 unique data-records linking influential physiochemical properties of the precursors (e.g., chemical composition; and specific surface area) and mixing procedure (e.g., curing conditions) of AACs with their properties (i.e., slump flow; and compressive strength). During training of the RF model, emphasis is given to rigorously optimize the underlying hyper-parameters so as to enhance the model's ultimate prediction performance. Prediction performance of the RF model is then benchmarked – using multiple statistical parameters – against a blind (to the model) test dataset. On the basis of aforesaid benchmarking, it is shown that the RF model is able to produce high fidelity predictions, as well as optimizations, of AACs' properties. This study also places emphasis on leveraging the training of the RF model to quantify the influence of each input parameter on the compressive strength and slump flow of ACCs. This enables the determination of input parameters that are highly influential to AACs properties; and those that are largely inconsequential.
