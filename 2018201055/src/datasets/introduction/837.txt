Solar Radiation (SR) influences hydrological processes, agricultural production, ecological services, public health and atmospheric circulation and therefore, comprehensive knowledge of SR at any location is vital to understand its economic potential and environmental sustainability (Abedinia et al., 2019, Ben Othman et al., 2018, Ghimire et al., 2019). Moreover, SR is a decisive and critical parameter for solar energy generation and management (Charabi et al., 2016, Gao et al., 2019). The recent effort of the replacement of fossil fuel sources with renewable energy resources has made SR as an important meteorological variable to measure and simulate renewable energy potential of any location of interest (Bagal et al., 2018). At present, 24% of the total global energy supply comes from renewable energy sources (Awasthi et al., 2020). Solar energy shares only 8.7% of the total renewable energy supply. However, solar energy’s share of overall renewable energy has risen exponentially from 0.04% in 2000 to 8.7% in 2018, reflecting an average annual growth rate of nearly 43% since 2000 (Naubi et al., 2016). The expansion of solar energy would continue, and it has been projected that global solar energy installation would expand by six folds by 2030 (Sharafati et al., 2019). Reliable estimation of SR including its annual and seasonal variability has paramount importance of estimating the solar energy potential and capacity (Alipour et al., 2017, Hafezi et al., 2017).
Generally, a conversion process required for the use of solar energy when the site is equipped with a radiometric measurement station operating steadily for a long period. The required data can be obtained using various techniques like measuring SR data by cell references and pyranometers as well as satellite sensors (Hai et al., 2020, Hou et al., 2018). Nevertheless, in most regions of the world, these crucial measurements are not effortlessly accessible due to technical, institutional, and financial limitations (Badescu et al., 2013, Benmouiza and Cheknane, 2016). Additionally, some developing countries do not have the technical capabilities and skilled manpower required to manage monitoring equipment and maintenance operations (Beyaztas et al., 2019). Furthermore, an accurate estimation of SR for a longer period is not available in most of the regions of the world. Therefore, modeling SR to construct daily or hourly data has become an important field of research in recent years.
The integration processes of solar energy sources have gradually become the greatest obstacle for energy demand in recent decades. A principal source of global warming is the burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal for energy generation in a conventional way. A rising number of countries around the world are paying considerable attention to environmental concerns like climate change, greenhouses, gas emissions, and global warming through the reduction of fossil fuel burning (AlOmar et al., 2020, Mathew et al., 2019, Tao et al., 2019, Xie et al., 2019). This significantly encouraged the utilization and exploitation of friendly and alternative sources of energy such as solar, wind power, and others (Jiang et al., 2015). Although the solar radiation is widely available, it has some properties that may hinder the efficiency and stability of power grid systems such as time-varying, intermittence, uncertainty and stochastic (Calif et al., 2013, Zeng et al., 2013). This presents a new challenging issue regarding the process of integrating the sources of solar energy into the power grids. Measuring all the properties of solar radiation requires relatively expensive sensors like radiometers, pyranometers, and pyrheliometers incorporated with data-acquisition software and hardware (Dong and Jiang, 2019). The installation of such equipment and sensors across the world are also time-consuming and cumbersome (Hussain and Alili, 2017). To address these obstacles, it is very necessary to develop reliable SR prediction models with easily available meteorological variables for accurate estimation of SR at any point of interest.
Modeling SR is much more challenging compared to any other meteorological variables (Bokde et al., 2020). The SR is scattered and absorbed by the atmosphere. Besides, several atmospheric and weather conditions like could cover, wind and rainfall influence the amount of SR reached to land surface (Budiyanto et al., 2020). On top of that, it is highly variable and random when estimated at the ground. Modeling such highly erratic and random variable using conventional statistical methods is always very difficult (Voyant et al., 2020). Several methodologies using conventional statistical approaches have been designed to predict SR using geographical and metrological data such as precipitation, sunshine, humidity, air temperature, longitude and latitude (Deo et al., 2016, Fan et al., 2018c, Fan et al., 2018a, Feng et al., 2018, Gouda et al., 2018, Hassan et al., 2016, Loghmari et al., 2018, Okundamiya et al., 2016, Premalatha and Naveen, 2018, Zou et al., 2016). Most of the conventional methods showed poor performance in predicting SR (Mohanty et al., 2016). Besides, they are unstable and less reliable in case of missing values in the dataset. The performance of such methods is also found to deteriorate rapidly with time and therefore, unsuitable for long-term predictions.
Artificial intelligence (AI) models have been used in recent years for better prediction of SR, considering their ability to simulate complex and nonlinear relationships and ability to handle missing data (Benmouiza and Cheknane, 2016, Feng et al., 2020, Kisi et al., 2019, Ghimire et al., 2019, Hai et al., 2020; Quej et al. 2017; Üstün et al. 2020). Several AI models have been introduced for SR prediction including artificial neural network (ANN), regression tree, genetic programming, support vector regression, data mining, and fuzzy logic (FL) (Voyant et al., 2017). Among the AI models, Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), a combination of ANN and FL approaches is considered one of the most efficient modeling techniques (Yaseen et al., 2019). Several studies showed a higher efficiency of ANFIS in predicting SR. For example, classical and hybrid ANFIS model by integrating ANFIS with particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution algorithm (DEA) were employed to predict monthly global SR from different metrological factors like maximum and minimum air temperature, rainfall, clearness index and sunshine duration at a station located in Kuala Terengganu, Malaysia (Halabi et al., 2018). The results showed that the hybrid ANFIS-PSA performs better in predicting SR than the other models. Classical models namely Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and different types of AI models including ANFIS were developed for prediction of daily global SR in Iraq using different metrological parameters (Nourani et al., 2019). The results illustrated that ANFIS provides more accurate result compared to other predictive models. A comparative analysis of different AI models in SR prediction revealed ANFIS is the most suitable for SR simulation due to its ability to capture the uncertainty associated with time series data (Mohammadi et al., 2016). However, the major problem of this model is the tuning of ANFIS hyperparameters such as, the optimization of membership function parameters (Castillo and Melin, 2012). Therefore, the traditional ANFIS model was hybridized with different optimization algorithms in previous studies for improving its performance. Though the performance of the existing hybrid ANFIS model is encouraging, the prediction capability is still needed to be enhanced considering the importance of the accuracy needed in SR measurement. Besides, one of the major limitations of existing SR prediction models is the requirement of many variables as input which are not readily available in some regions due to the lack of monitoring network.
The feasibility metaheuristics algorithms have showed a remarkable progression in modeling several engineering problems (Katebi et al., 2019, Sadeghipour Chahnasir et al., 2018). A novel model by hybridizing ANFIS with two metaheuristics algorithms namely, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) and Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) is proposed in this study for the prediction of SR. Hybridization of AI model with SSA provides advantages of low computational cost and ease of implementation. However, the major drawbacks of this metaheuristic algorithms are low exploitation ability, slow convergence, and local optima entrapment. This study attempts to overcome these drawbacks of SSA by introducing a mutation approach using a novel metaheuristic, GOA with the SSA process which is referred to as muSG in this article. The muSG is used to train the ANFIS model to improve its prediction performance. The proposed approach is collectively called ANFIS-muSG in this article. The performance of the proposed ANFIS-muSG model was compared with ANFIS, ANFIS-GOA, ANFIS-SSA, ANFIS-Grey Wolf Optimizer (ANFIS-GWO), ANFIS-Particle Swarm Optimization (ANFIS-PSO), ANFIS-Genetic Algorithm (ANFIS-GA) and ANFIS-Dragonfly Algorithm (ANFIS-DA) to show its efficacy. It is expected that the novel model proposed in this study would able to address the challenge of low predictivity of existing SR models due to its high and irregular variability and randomness.
