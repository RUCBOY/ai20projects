Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) can be used to found various DNA genetic markers in large-scale populations through large samples, multiple centers and repeated verification methods at the genome-wide level [1], [2], such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) [3] (SNP) or Copy Number Variations [4] (CNV) and other genetic factors related to complex diseases. In this way, the genetic genes related to the occurrence, development and treatment of human diseases are fully revealed [5], [6], [7]. The SNP set analysis method in GWAS has high efficiency in identifying causal SNPs [8], [9], [10], [11], [12]. In theoretical level, disease-related genes can be identified by genotyping all SNP loci in haplotypes. It is impossible to genotype all SNP loci, since it is costly [13]. The research results show that many SNP loci have certain correlation, so some representative SNP sets carry almost all information of haplotype [14], [15], [16], [17]. A few number of SNPs loci taking almost all information of SNP loci are called informative SNP set or tagSNP-set. The cost of genotyping is greatly reduced by using tagSNP-set instead of all SNPs [18], [19], [20]. Therefore, the research of tagSNP-set selection method is a hotspot in the field of GWAS. Currently, numerous studies have been conducted to describe linkage disequilibrium (LD) structures and to apply these structures to tagSNP-set selection [16], [21], [22], [23]. The tagSNP-set selection methods based on LD are most widely used.
The tagSNP-set selection methods based on LD firstly calculate the LD coefficient between each pair of SNPs and then divide all SNPs into multiple subsets according to LD information. Finally, the methods select the most representative SNPs in each set as the tagSNPs [16]. Because the LD between each pair SNPs has a great influence on the statistical efficiency of association analysis [21], [24], [25], [26], it is an effective method to select tagSNP-set. Carlson et al. first proposed the concept of LD clusters, and found that the SNP loci of a LD cluster was often situated in the adjacent area [16]. Each LD cluster corresponds to one/several tagSNP(s), and the other SNPs in the cluster have a strong correlation with tagSNP(s). Based on LD clusters, Ao et al. used hierarchical clustering and graph clustering methods to strictly define the combination of each LD set and the selection of tagSNP-set in the LD set [27]. Based on Ao’s study, Shan et al. introduced the functional information of each SNP locus, and added the user-specified guidance parameters to make the selection of tagSNPs specific [28]. There is also a certain correlation among the SNP loci that are far away in the organism. The above methods only considers SNPs in adjacent chromosomal regions or in the same haplotype block when calculating LD. To overcome this disadvantage, Phuong et al. used each SNP locus as a feature, defined the loci distance according to the LD between each pair of SNP loci (D=1−r2), and obtained the tagSNP-set by the feature selection [29]. Yan et al. proposed a weighted tagSNP-set selection method by weighting each tagSNP in a tagSNP-set based on LD, which divides SNPs into several subsets based on the LD between each pair of SNPs, and then assigns an appropriate weight to select the tagSNP-set for each SNP [30], [31]. Wang et al. proposed a maximum information tagSNP-set selection algorithm (TSMI) to minimize the number of SNPs in the selected tagSNP-set and maximize the expressed information [32]. Although the tagSNP-set selection method based on LD can select high-quality tagSNP-set, the prediction accuracy of the tagSNP-set selected by these methods still need to be improved.
Not only the research of tagSNP-set selection method is a research hotspot in the field of GWAS, but also evaluating the quality of the selected tagSNP-set is an important issue [33], [34], [35], [36]. Halperin et al. proposed the selection of tag SNPs to maximize prediction accuracy (STAMPA) to evaluate the quality of tagSNP-set [37]. STAMPA uses easy-to-obtain genotype data instead of haplotype data in the prediction process, and the prediction process of the method is not limited by the division of haplotype blocks. Each non-tagSNP locus is predicted by tagSNPs. However, STAMPA only considers the tagSNPs that are closest to the physical distance (PD) of the non-tagSNP that need to be predicted. STAMPA without taking the biological distance between the SNPs, so the prediction efficiency is not high. Ilhan et al. used the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to select tagSNP-set, then used SVM, particle swarm algorithm and leave-one-out cross method to evaluate the selected tagSNP-set [38]. This method optimizes parameters to improve efficiency by iterative manner. However, this method requires all the tagSNP-set in the prediction process and excessively relies on the number of iterations. The method is compared with the STAMPA, and the results shows that the method is better than the STAMPA. Mauawad et al. proposed a Linkage Coverage method to evaluate the quality of tagSNP-set based on the LD between the non-tagSNP and the tagSNP, and used all tagSNPs to predict non-tagSNPs [39]. This method overcomes the shortcoming of the STAMPA considering only PD among SNPs, and can evaluate the quality of the selected tagSNP-set well. However, Linkage Coverage only calculates the LD between the tagSNP and the non-tagSNP, and excessively relies on LD information, which also reduces the evaluation quality of the tagSNP-set.
Based on the questions raised above, we come up with a novel method called TagSNP-set Selection by Optimal Iteration with Linkage Disequilibrium (TSOILD). Compared with other methods, TSOILD method not only improves the quality of the selected tagSNP-set, but also guarantees the stability of the selected tagSNP-set. Moreover, a quantificationally analytical tagSNP-set prediction method called Physical Distance-Linkage Disequilibrium Prediction Method (PDLDPM) is constructed. PDLDPM remedies the shortcomings of STAMPA and Linkage Coverage, soPDLDPM can better to predict tagSNP-set to STAMPA and Linkage Coverage.
The structure of the present paper is described below. Firstly, the research and application of tagSNP-set is introduced. Then, a TSOILD method to select tagSNP-set is construct. Next, PDLDPM to predict non-tagSNP by tagSNP-set is construct. Then, we verify the effectiveness of TSOILD method and PDLDPM by experiment. Finally, we discuss both of our methods in detail.
