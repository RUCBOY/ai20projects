The parallel processing capability of optical information is attributed for its utility and ubiquity in numerous areas of our daily lives. The progress in optical information technology has ushered new security and privacy challenges for optical data storage and transmission technologies [1], [2]. Optical image encryption is a common optical information security technology whose earliest version, the double random phase encoding (DRPE) method [3], employs two random phase masks for execution in the spatial and Fourier domains of the optical image. Subsequent technologies employed different transformations to improve the security of DRPE optical cryptographic systems.
Despite offering gains in many areas, the direct use of these transforms in DRPE optical systems [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] is inconsequential from the perspective of security. Moreover, on their own these transforms are incapable of securing the systems [13]. Consequently, numerous hybrid optical-digital encryption techniques have been investigated as platforms for securing optical information systems [2]. The parallelism and other astounding properties attributed to quantum systems [14], [15], however, present yet another challenge secure optical information system. Within this powerful paradigms, discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) [16] are known to possess chaotic dynamical behaviours that can be exploited for designing tamper-proof quantum and classical cryptographic applications [17], [18], [19], [20], [21].
Our study utilises alternate quantum walks (AQW) which are reputed for generating a probability distribution of size N x N (where N is the number of nodes on the circle) that circumvents predictable collision attacks required to safeguard optical systems. The quantum mechanical properties at the heart of AQW as well as its initial key parameters are used to generate permutations that diffuse the original image yielding two random masks for the DRPE process. Outcomes from simulation-based experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed technique in securing information systems.
The remainder of the study is outlined as follows. Rudimentary background on AQW is presented in Section 2. This provides foundation for designing our proposed optical imaging protocol whose details are presented in Section 3. Subsequently, in Section 4, we present performance analysis to validate the proposed technique.
