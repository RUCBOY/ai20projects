Feature matching, which aims to establish reliable correspondences between two feature sets, poses a fundamental and critical problem in computer vision and pattern recognition [1], [2], [3]. It is a popular topic and has been widely used in stereo vision matching [4], structure from motion [5], image fusion [6], simultaneous localization and mapping, video stitching, image retrieval, point and image registration [7], [8], [9]. Feature matching is a highly complex problem in non-Pareto criterion complex optimization due to its combinatorial nature. Specifically, matching N points to other N points leads to a total of N! permutations [10]. Many approaches have been proposed to address this problem. The common idea is to first obtain a set of putative correspondences (initial matches) by using a local image descriptor (e.g., scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) [11]) and remove outliers (incorrect matches) with additional geometrical constraints [12]. The current study focuses on removing mismatches from several given putative point correspondences. We review several representative methods and present them below.
1.1. Prior workLocal feature descriptors, such as SIFT [11] or its variations [13], [14], have been applied to compute sets of putative correspondences. To enhance the accuracy of SIFT descriptors based on putative correspondence establishment approaches, researchers have developed sophisticated algorithms via triangle constraint [15], Earth mover’s distance [16], or region-adaptive descriptor [17] to generate improved putative correspondences. However, these methods inevitably introduce many mismatches due to matching ambiguity. Therefore, we need to perform a robust estimation based on the global geometric constraints of a point set to detect and remove outliers.Many methods have been proposed to remove false correspondences from a putative correspondence set, and they can be roughly divided into four classes, namely, statistical regression, resampling, nonparametric interpolation, and graph matching methods. Inspired by sparse representation theory, the l1 norm is much more robust to real noise than the l2 norm is in many applications [18]. The approach proposed by [19] involves a l1 norm-based mismatch removal algorithm to resist a larger proportion of outliers compared with quadratic l2 norms [19]. Liu et al. [20] proposed an accurate rigid transformation estimation method through iterative 3D point match weighting. In [21], Maier et al. introduced a guided matching scheme based on statistical optical flow.The most representative feature matching method is random sample consensus (RANSAC), which randomly selects a subset of correspondences that can fit a given transformation model and subsequently calculates the model parameters. This method has been extended to maximum likelihood estimation sample and consensus [22] and progressive sample consensus [23]. Although the algorithm and its variations have achieved great success in feature matching, they also possess limitations. For example, the algorithm relies on a geometric parameter model; however, when the scene contains non-rigid motion, the geometric relationship among images does not meet any parameter model, and the algorithm becomes invalid [24].Scholars have proposed non-parametric interpolation methods to address this issue [24], [25], [26]. Non-parametric methods commonly interpolate a non-parametric function based on the assumption that the motion field associated with the feature correspondence is slow and smooth. Graph matching is another typical and powerful feature matching method [27], [28], [29], [30]. This method can obtain the ordered features of a point set based on the graph spectrum by solving a global optimization problem and constructing the affinity matrix of feature points [31]. Representative graph-matching-based feature matching approaches include dual decomposition (DD) [32], spectral matching (SM) [33], graph shift (GS) [34], and progressive graph matching (PGM) [35]. The DD algorithm [32] formulates the feature matching into an energy minimization problem. SM [33] uses a high-efficiency method to determine the correspondence between two sets of features, and GS [34] constructs an affinity graph based on the SM algorithm [33], where the maximal clique of the graph is regarded as the spatial correspondences. The approach proposed by [36] uses local neighborhoods for feature description, and graph-based feature matching is presented to prevent false matches. To alleviate the performance degradation caused by improper initialization, Cho et al. [35] proposed the PGM method to re-estimate the target graphs in a Bayesian manner, thus boosting the performance in the subsequent graph matching. Although graph-matching-based algorithms can provide considerable flexibility to the object model and deliver robust matching and recognition, especially for non-rigid scenes, they still suffer from high complexity due to their non-polynomial-hard nature. In addition, when the mismatch rate is relatively high, the performance of graph matching decreases sharply [37].Ma et al. [38], [39], [40] proposed a novel mismatch-removing framework based on locality preserving matching (LPM). They found that the absolute distance between two feature points of an image pair may change significantly under viewpoint change or non-rigid deformation, but the spatial neighborhood relationship between the feature points (representing the topological structures of an image scene) is generally well preserved [41], [42], [43], [44]. Accordingly, they developed a robust and effective mismatch-removing method by maintaining the local neighborhood structures of potential true matches. This method can efficiently handle rigid and non-rigid deformations related to two images.
1.2. Motivations and contributionsWe present a ranking list preservation approach for feature matching in this paper to effectively exploit the local neighborhood structures of feature points. The approach applies the top K rank similarity to measure the differences in topological structures of two feature points. We call our proposed method top K rank preservation (TopKRP)-based feature matching. Our proposed method considers the differences between neighbors (different neighbors have different ranking indices) and thus exploit the true topological similarity. Given a pair of images, we first obtain initial matches by adopting the similarity of local feature descriptors, such as SIFT. Second, we search the K nearest neighbors (K-NN) to obtain the ranking list for the feature point. Lastly, the ranking list of the corresponding feature point is calculated with the corresponding K-NN. By doing so, we transform the data from the feature space to the ranking list space (Fig. 1). Therefore, the topological structure similarity of two feature points can be simply calculated by comparing the ranking lists, which are measured by the top K ranking distance. The simplest way to obtain the ranking list is to calculate the spatial Euclidean distance between feature points in the putative set. However, this may lead to high sensitive to the outliers with respect to its ranking position. Therefore, in this paper we further propose to add another ranking form based on the angle correlation between feature points, thus achieving promising and robust matching performance.Download : Download high-res image (308KB)Download : Download full-size imageFig. 1. Comparison between local-feature-based similarity measurement and the proposed top K rank similarity. Representing a data point with ranking lists can transform the data from the feature space to the ranking list space. Thus, the topological structure similarity of two feature points can be simply calculated by comparing their ranking lists.This is an extend version of our previous work [45]. In addition to preliminary results published in [45], here we give the primary new contributions of this paper: i) a comprehensive review of the feature matching problem is given in the introduction section; ii) to measure the ranking similarity, the previous method only considers the spatial Euclidean distance and this may lead to sensitivity to the outliers. In this paper, we additionally introduce the angle correlation between feature points to exploit the local geometrical information and measure the similarity of each putative match; iii) additional analysis on neighborhoods preserving and ranking list preservation method, and additional analysis on influence of the outlier ratio; iv) in addition to conduct the comparison experiments on 10 widely used image pairs, we further collect two large datasets, MI52 and RS153, which have 52 medical images and 153 remote sensing image pairs, and extensive experimental results on these two datasets are added to evaluate the performance; v) we apply the proposed TopKRP method to a high-level vision task, i.e., image retrieval, to verify its usefulness.Although our previously developed LPM [38] and the proposed TopKRP method preserve the topological structures of two feature points from image pairs, their differences lie in the definitions of the topological similarity between feature points. LPM [38] defines the topological similarity between feature points by calculating the intersection of neighbors. It ignores the differences among neighbors and cannot easily exploit the true topology. By contrast, in the proposed TopKRP method, we represent a data point with ranking lists and transform the data from the feature space to the ranking list space. The topological structure similarity of two feature points is then calculated by comparing their ranking lists.
